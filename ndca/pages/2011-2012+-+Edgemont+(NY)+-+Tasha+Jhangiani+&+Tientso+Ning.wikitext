Contemporary Asian-American experience is shaped by two interlocking forms of White Supremacy – FIRST – is the “frontier settler” mentality that justified the founding violence of the United States – SECOND – is the US Empire that enforces the global fiction of White civilization. Asian liberation requires analyzing both structures in order to move beyond the Black-White binary paradigm.

==(((( Topicality ))))== 

===T- Bases=== 

**Interpretation: Military presence is bases.**
__**<span style="font-size: 14px;">Lutz ‘9 </span>**__
**(**professor of International Studies at Brown (Catherine, The Bases of Empire: The Global Struggle Against U.S. Military Posts, p. 6, google books)
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Bases are the literal and symbolic anchors, and the most visible centerpieces, of the U.S. military presence overseas</span>. To understand where those bases are and how they are being used is essential for understanding the United States’ relationship with the rest of the world, the role of coercion in it, and its political economic complexion. The United States’ empire of bases – its massive global impact and the global response to it – are the subject of chapters in this book. Unlike the pundits and the strategic thinkers who corner the market on discussions of the U.S. military, these authors concentrate on the people around those bases and the impact of living in their shadow. The authors describe as well the social movements which have tried to call the world’s attention to the costs those bases impose on them without their consent. In this introduction, I ask why the bases were established in the first place, how they are currently configured around the world and how that configuration is changing, what myths have developed about the functions U.S. overseas bases serve, and, finally, introduce the global movement to push back or expel the bases altogether.

**Violation: Affirmative does not reduce bases.**

**Vote neg on limits – Failure to reduce bases explodes the topic justifying infinite permutations of troops, naval, and air force affs that reduce specific brigades leading to tiny and unpredictable affs – impact is stale, anti-educational debates. <span style="background-color: #ffff00; font-size: 140%;">We provide the best limits on the topic.</span>**


===T-Development (New)=== 

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">A: </span>**Development is defined as producing something new**

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Development: systematic application of knowledge or understanding, directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, and systems or methods,</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">B: Violation - The Affirmative promotes satellite hardening - it is just improving something that already exists.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">C: Prefer our definition - </span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The definition comes from a space program, which is the ultimate authority on space travel, so it would be the most valid definition. This promotes critical thinking and decision-making education because it promotes decisions made based on the most knowledgeable source rather than other definitions, which could be random or broad. Further there is a clear intent to define, rather than an assertion.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Limits</span>
The definition says a specific list of things that can be done, meaning it limits the debate to a certain degree, while allowing for many advocacies on both sides. This has a direct link to education because limiting the debate creates a predictable debate and prevents debaters from bad debate practices running overly obscure positions to avoid debate clash.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">D: </span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vote off of education because debate is considered “intellectual competition.” The point of debate is to become educated on topics as well as to promote critical thinking and decision making. If debate wasn’t educational, it would also promote bad debate practice like taking positions meant to be hard to predict rather than educational, avoiding an actual debate rather than engaging in one.</span>

**This both turns and solves the case better because good and bad are not binary. They wrongly think it’s a zero-sum power struggle between white and blacks, a fight between two sides – the police and the policed. The struggle of 21st century politics is not a struggle oriented around race; rather, it is the very concept of race which has come to inhibit and constrain radical politics. The affirmative’s deployment of the concept of race as the organizational focus of political struggle is a smokescreen which obscures the dynamics of oppression – the very deployment of race as a concept itself is the lynchpin of racialized oppression.**

**They ignore the existence of a Racial Contract, one that applies only to the privileged white, which forms the status quo into a color-coded world that is structured all around them – this type of racial ignorance blankets oppression and normalizes white privilege into historical context, creates a racial space that prescribes everything out of that space as “savage” and untouchable, justifies generations of genocide and killing.**

**Traditional knowledge production within the debate community acts to expand the cages allowing for less constraints to the non-white, to give the illusion of freedom, while the cage still remains but the thought of confinement is out of the mind because we ignore the actuality of the situation, shrouded by the focus of governmental policy education that only goes to eliminate the “disruption” caused by the problem, and in turn forces the outcomes of racism to be inevitable.**

**White Supremacy is the unnamed political system, the //sine qua non// of contemporary politics that constructs the way political discussions and engagements are made to benefit the whites, our discussion is key to create antagonism and challenge white politics in order to rupture the political structure responsible for violence.**

<span style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">White supremacy is the unnamed political system that has made the modern world what it is today. You will not find this term in</span> introductory, or even advanced, <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">texts in political theory.</span> ..., one possible way of making this connection with mainstream theory, since it uses the vocabulary and apparatus already developed for contractarianism to map this unacknowledged system. Contract talk is, after all, the political lingua franca of our times.</span>

**Successful politics against White Supremacy must begin with analysis of the key historical moments that constitute contemporary American imperialism and racism – our uncovering of historical violence against Asian migrants helps us formulate contemporary anti-racism coalitions based on early survival strategies.**
