The concerns about weaponization lack logical foundation – space is weaponized and NMD is necessary to protect essential US space assets<br />
IWG 9 (The Independent Working Group is co-chaired by Dr. Robert Pfaltzgraff, President of the Institute of Foreign Policy Analysis (IFPA) at Tufts University, and by Dr. William R. Van Cleave, Professor Emeritus of the Department of Defense and Strategic Studies at Missouri State University, and a member of the original U.S. delegation which drafted the 1972 ABM Treaty.

<br />
Although space is already extensively used for military pur¬poses, the notion that space differs fundamentally from land, sea, or air with regard to the deployment of weapons is sym¬pathetically received in some quarters. The desire to preserve a sanctuary in space, defined as keeping space free from mili¬tary activities, gives rise to policy and programmatic recom¬mendations that lack logical foundation and are contrary to U.S. interests. This includes the contention that the weap¬onization of space is, or should be, prohibited or drastically limited by international treaties.3 The result can be seen in ef¬forts – such as the Space Preservation Act, first introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2001 and reintroduced in May 20054 – that, if enacted, would have the effect of prohibit¬ing the United States from developing, producing, or deploy¬ing space-based weapons and their components and would pave the way for an international treaty impeding or prevent¬ing U.S. use of space for national security purposes, including missile defense – enacting once again prohibitions against space-based missile defense that were removed with the ter¬mination of the ABM Treaty. It has been argued speciously that, since some space-based weapons could be used to attack targets in the at¬mosphere, at sea, or on the ground, they should be banned. Such reasoning, if it had been applied to maritime forc¬es, would have excluded naval vessels with the ability, like space-based systems, to attack targets thousands of kilome¬ters away. These naval systems include surface vessels and submarines armed with missiles and weapons of mass de¬struction (WMD) warheads. They have vast, over-the-hori¬zon destructive capacity, just as space-based systems could destroy far distant targets. For example, directed-energy weapons would be able to destroy targets either in space or on Earth at great speeds. However, whether directed-energy weapons are offensive or defensive, like surface ships and submarines, depends on how they are used. Space-based directed-energy mis¬sile defense systems, deployed to destroy ballistic missiles launched against the United States, cannot be deemed of¬fensive systems. To argue otherwise is to equate those who would launch such an attack using missiles armed with WMD warheads with those who seek to defend themselves from such an attack. Equally absurd is the notion that the United States can, and should, take the lead in banning space-based systems and thus provide an example to the international community. Here the assumption is that the United States can establish global regimes that will strength¬en or create international norms against the weaponization of space. The burden of proof that such an American ap¬proach would achieve its objectives is not supported by the history of conflict. The ability of states and other actors to utilize new geographical arenas, whether at sea, on land, or in the air, has led to conflict and competition based on avail¬able technologies in these diverse settings. At the same time, it is suggested that a decision by the United States to fore¬go the deployment of space-based assets will lead to com¬parable restraint on the part of others. It is equally plausi¬ble to suggest that such self-abnegation by the United States will only encourage others to fill the resulting political vac¬uum. This debate is discussed in greater detail in the next two sections of this report. Moreover, the drive to restrict U.S. access to space, wheth¬er for missile defense or for broader missions, is fundamen¬tally flawed not only because space has been used for mil¬itary purposes for several decades but also because space has become an arena for conflict regardless of U.S. policy. It was Nazi Germany, not the United States, that was responsi¬ble for the initial transit through space, accomplished by the V-2 rocket. The weaponization of space began in the closing months of World War II in Europe when German V-2 rock¬ets passed through the edge of space en route to their tar¬gets. More than a decade later, in 1957, the Soviet Union, not the United States, launched the first orbiting satellite, Sput¬nik, ushering in a space age in which nearly all space plat¬forms have some potential military use. Space-based satel¬lites, which are critically important to U.S. national security in the twenty-first century, have civilian as well as military applications. Although the United States is at the forefront of space technology in the early twenty-first century, this clearly was not always the case, nor is it inevitable that such dominance will continue. Like the early V-2, today’s ballistic missiles fly a large part of their trajectory through space en route to their targets. Furthermore, both the Soviet Union and the United States tested anti-satellite (ASAT) systems as far back as the 1950s. Russia continues to operate ASAT sys-tems initially deployed by the Soviet Union. As noted later in this section, other countries, China in particular, are devel-oping space programs to interdict U.S. space capabilities. In addition, technologies capable of destroying/disrupting U.S. space operations will increasingly be available to a range of other actors, including terrorist groups. The United States must protect its critically important space systems, which are obvious targets for future adver¬saries who will seek to eliminate the edge those assets give our military forces. This asymmetric U.S. advantage is well known to even limited powers who confront U.S. interests, and they will inevitably strive to reduce that advantage if they seek to attack the United States – and today’s tech¬nology makes that possibility a serious concern. Perpetu¬ating the well-known vulnerability of U.S. space assets is, therefore, an unacceptable security risk. The crucial impor¬tance of space was clearly highlighted in the early 1990s by the results of the first Gulf War – which the then-Air Force chief of staff, General Merrill McPeak, called the first “space war.”5 More recently, space-based assets, including com¬munications and surveillance systems and sensors, again were essential to the rapid and decisive military victory in Iraq. Operation Iraqi Freedom would have been impossible to conduct with lightning speed and low casualties in the absence of space-based assets providing for unprecedent¬ed connectivity among internetted military systems.6 U.S. space systems are also playing a vital role in the current counter-insurgencies in Afghanistan and Iraq. The impor¬tance of space systems for the United States and its allies lies in their utter ubiquity throughout the spectrum of conflict at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of war.<br />

NMD exists, just very limited and lacks global capacity due to political ignorance<br />

So far, however, the United States has stopped short of putting these principles into practice. Rather, the mis-sile defense system that has been deployed so far provides extremely limited coverage. It is intended as a limited de¬fense against a small, rogue-state threat scenario. Left unad¬ dressed are the evolving missile arsenals of – and potential missile threats from – modernizing strategic competitors such as Russia and China as well as terrorists launching short-range missiles such as Scuds from off-shore vessels. The key impediments to the development of a more ro¬bust layered system that includes space-based interdiction assets have been more political than technological. A small but vocal minority has so far succeeded in driving the de¬bate against missile defense and especially space-based mis¬sile defense. The outcome has been that political consider¬ations have by and large dictated technical behavior, with the goal of developing the most technologically sound and cost-effective defenses subordinated to other interests. A symptom of this problem is the fact that, in spite of a commitment to protecting the United States from ballis¬tic missile attack, little has been done to revive the cutting-edge technologies developed in the 1980s and early 1990s – technologies that produced the most effective, least costly ways to defend the U.S. homeland, its deployed troops, and its international partners from the threat of ballistic missile attack. The most impressive of these initiatives was Brilliant Pebbles. By 1992, that initiative – entailing the deployment of a constellation of small, advanced kill-vehicles in space – had developed a cheap, effective means of destroying en¬emy ballistic missiles in all modes of flight. Yet in the early 1990s, along with a number of other promising programs, it fell victim to a systematic eradication of space-based tech¬nologies that marked the closing years of the twentieth cen¬tury and still impedes the development of the most effective missile defense today.<br />

Advantage 1:China<br />

1. Recent US actions dashed the hopes of peaceful reunification – China will try to force Taiwan’s unification to the mainland<br />
Lister 10[ Charles R. Lister, Research Assistant Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, Researcher The Centre for the Study of Terrorism &amp; Political Violence, Editorial Assistant at The Diplomat, Article on e-IR “ US Missile Defence and Space Security: a Security Dilemma for China? “<br />
<br />
Taiwan is a major foreign policy issue for China and has been largely since 1949 when the People’s Republic was established. Beijing’s ‘One China’ policy foresees that eventually, Taiwan will ‘reunify’ with the mainland – until that time, Beijing considers it a ‘renegade province’ illegitimately seeking independence (taidu).[25] Officially, Beijing has a policy that accepts the necessary use of ‘non-peaceful means’ in the event of a Taiwanese push for independence. U.S. support for Taiwan has been clear ever since the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 and the subsequent 1954 Mutual Security Pact that placed “China’s Taiwan ‘province’ under U.S. protection.”[26] Crucially regarding the focus of this paper is the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act that committed the U.S. to provide Taiwan with “arms of a defensive character”[27] in order to prevent Chinese coercive (re)unification. In January 2010, President Obama announced the approval of an arms deal with Taiwan worth $6.7 billion that crucially included one-hundred and fourteen Patriot-3 anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs),[28] the purpose of which is clearly to deter the one thousand four-hundred Chinese offensive missiles and rockets currently deployed across the Strait.[29] For China, this considerably undermines hopes for eventual reunification and serves only to bolster Taiwanese self-confidence and give the U.S. more freedom of action in any conflict over Taiwan. For Rex Li, the U.S. sale of TMD systems to Taipei is part of a wider U.S. policy of “using Taiwan to constrain China” (yitai zhihua)[30] and undermines previous U.S. assurances of ‘strategic ambiguity’ over the Taiwan issue. For others, such a sale is “tantamount to a military alliance”[31] directed against China, and, because the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) arguably represents the most notable ‘nationalist’ or realist voice within China, will serve only to encourage escalatory moves such as incentivizing increased missile deployments opposite Taiwan – thus exemplifying a security dilemma. Further to this, China has serious concerns regarding the stability of various outlying provinces, like Tibet or Xinjiang, where secessionist, anti-government movements could be bolstered by an increasingly confident Taiwanese independence movement backed by U.S. weapons and support. Even though one-hundred and fourteen Patriot-3 missiles cannot defend Taiwan from a full-scale Chinese missile strike, sophisticated BMD technology in the hands of Taipei symbolizes a highly significant shift in the power balance. China has, as the result of one U.S. action, lost a crucial measure of strategic leverage over American regional power and will presumably have to respond counteractively.<br />

2. SB-BMD key to stop China from crossing Taiwan Straight<br />

<br />
The PRC military threat to Taiwan has increased dramatically over the years as China has deployed approximately 1500 short- and medium-range ballistic missiles along the Taiwan Strait [2]. While China’s ability to coerce or attack Taiwan with its increasingly sophisticated fighter aircraft and submarine fleets are ever-increasing threats, in the absence of a comprehensive Taiwan missile-defense system, the military and political risk for China of a missile attack remains significantly less than that of air strikes or a blockade. Moreover, China’s ability to launch an amphibious invasion of Taiwan remains limited by its sea lift and amphibious attack capabilities [3]. Since 2002, the U.S. government has assessed that Taiwan no longer has the capability to maintain air dominance over its territory [4]. Taiwan’s ground-based air defenses—its U.S.-supplied Patriot and I-Hawk missiles, it’s domestically produced Tien Kung I and II (Sky Bow) missiles [5], and its air force still pose a major risk for Chinese fighter and bomber aircraft. How long would it take for China to overcome Taiwan’s air defenses, what loses China would incur in achieving that goal, and how long would it take the U.S. Pacific Fleet to come to Taiwan’s defense are part of a dynamic deterrence equation that has been shifting in China’s favor for at least the past decade [6]. Operational deployment of China’s recently unveiled J-20 “stealth” fighter [7] remains several years away. Its introduction certainly would further tip the balance of power toward China and gives further arguments for the sale of new F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan. Sustaining a military blockade of Taiwan is also not without risk for China. It risks igniting a broader conflict; and if Taiwan sunk just one PRC warship in response, it would be an embarrassment for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). It is not clear how Taiwan’s major trading partners, Japan and the United States, would react should the PRC take military action against an American or Japanese flagged ship attempting or perceived to be attempting to challenge the blockade. They and the United Nations would have plenty of time to condemn China and take other actions to mitigate the result a blockade was intended to produce. A missile attack on Taiwan, in the absence of an adequate missile-defense, however, poses little risk for China beyond the international condemnation that would follow. How the international community would react to a ballistic-missile attack on Taiwan depends largely on the events leading up to it. From a purely military perspective, however, no aircraft, ships, or PRC military personnel would be at hazard. Certainly, Taiwan could attack targets on the Chinese mainland in retaliation, but Taiwan’s capability to do that with missiles and aircraft is limited, and the systems and bases Taiwan would use for such attacks would be among the primary targets of a PRC ballistic-missile strike.<br />

According to the Defense Department, “China has the most active ballistic missile program in the world. It is develop¬ing and testing offensive missiles, forming additional missile units, qualitatively upgrading certain missile systems, and developing methods to counter ballistic missile defenses.”46 PRC missile modernization efforts build upon current capa¬bilities that encompass ballistic missiles able to target the United States as well as Japan and other regional U.S. allies. For example, China has over 46 Dong-feng 4, Dong-feng 5, and Dong-feng 31 intercontinental ballistic missiles, approx¬imately 35 intermediate-range (Dong-feng 3, and Dong-feng 21) missiles, and hundreds of short-range rockets currently deployed.47 Between 990 and 1,070 SRBMs are deployed op¬posite Taiwan, and the People’s Liberation Army is increasing this force by more than 100 missiles each year.48 At the same time, China is in the midst of a massive, multi-year strategic-military modernization program, encompassing air power, naval, and land force capabilities, air defense, and electron¬ic-, information- and space-warfare technologies.49 As part of this effort, China is upgrading its existing bal¬listic missile arsenal. This includes the deployment of its Dong-feng 31 and Dong-feng 31A ICBMs with multiple inde¬pendently targetable re-entry vehicle (MIRV) warhead tech¬nology designed to defeat primitive anti-missile systems, priority solid-fuel propellant research intended to provide Beijing with immediate “launch on command” capabili¬ties, and the transformation of its strategic offensive forc¬es from large, stationary missiles to more versatile road- and rail-mobile variants. Notably, a successful flight test of China’s new submarine-launched version of the Dong-feng 31, the Julang 2, was conducted in June 2005.50 The Julang 2 has a range of up to 9,600 kilometers and, according to the U.S. Air Force’s National Air Intelligence Center, “will, for the first time, allow Chinese [missile submarines] to target portions of the United States from operating areas located near the Chinese coast.”51 These capabilities are even more troubling in light of remarks made by Chinese Major Gener¬al Zhu Chenghu, who declared that nuclear weapons would have to be used if the United States intervened militarily in a conflict over Taiwan.52<br />

<br />
A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/<br />
or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study<br />

Scenario 2 is EMP:<br />
<br />
1.War with China will result in EMP attack, crippling the US economy and destroying the Us military<br />

A noted Chinese theorist on modern warfare, Chang Mengxiong, compared China's form of fighting to &quot;a Chinese boxer with a keen knowledge of vital body points who can bring an opponent to his knees with a minimum of movements&quot;. It is like key acupuncture points in ancient Chinese medicine. Puncture one vital point and the whole anatomy is affected. If America ever goes to war with China, say, over Taiwan, then America should be prepared for the following &quot;acupuncture points&quot; in its anatomy to be &quot;punctured&quot;. Each of the vital points can bring America to its knees with a minimum of effort. I Electro-magnetic Pulse (EMP) attack China and Russia are two potential US adversaries that have the capability for this kind of attack. An EMP attack can either come from an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), a long-range cruise missile, or an orbiting satellite armed with a nuclear or non-nuclear EMP warhead. A nuclear burst of one (or more) megaton some 400 kilometers over central United States (Omaha, Nebraska) can blanket the whole continental US with electro-magnetic pulse in less than one second. An EMP attack will damage all electrical grids on the US mainland. It will disable computers and other similar electronic devices with microchips. Most businesses and industries will shut down. The entire US economy will practically grind to a halt. Satellites within line of sight of the EMP burst will also be damaged, adversely affecting military command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR). Land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles will be rendered unserviceable in their silos. Anti-ballistic missile defenses will suffer the same fate. In short – total blackout. And American society as we know it will be thrown back to the Dark Ages. Of course, the US may decide to strike first, but China and Russia now have the means of striking back with submarine-launched ballistic missiles with the same or even more devastating results. But knowing China's strategy of &quot;active defense&quot;, when war with the US becomes imminent, China will surely not allow itself to be targeted first. It will seize the initiative as mandated by its doctrine by striking first. China has repeatedly announced that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons. But as an old Chinese saying goes: &quot;There can never be too much deception in war.&quot; If it means the survival of the whole Chinese nation that is at stake, China will surely not allow a public statement to tie its hands and prevent it from seizing the initiative. As another saying goes: &quot;All is fair in love and war.&quot;<br />

The functioning of society and the economy is critically dependent upon the availability of electricity. Essentially every aspect of American society requires electrical power to function. Contemporary U.S. society is not structured, nor does it have the means, to provide for the needs of nearly 300 million Americans without electricity. Continued electrical supply is necessary for sustaining water supplies, production and distribution of food, fuel, communications, and everything else that is a part of our economy. Continuous, reliable electrical supply within very tight frequency boundaries is a critical element to the continued existence and growth of the United States and most developed countries. For most Americans, production of goods and services and most of life’s activities stop during a power outage. Not only is it impossible to perform many everyday domestic and workplace tasks, but also people must divert their time to dealing with the consequences of having no electricity. In the extreme, they must focus on survival itself. The situation is not different for the economy at large. No other infrastructure could, by its own collapse alone, create such an outcome. All other infrastructures rely on electric power. Conversely, the electric power infrastructure is dependent on other infrastructures that are themselves vulnerable to the direct effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) in ways that are described elsewhere in this report. No infrastructure other than electric power has the potential for nearly complete collapse in the event of a sufficiently robust EMP attack. While a less robust attack could result in less catastrophic outcomes, those outcomes would still have serious consequences and threaten national security.<br />

Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is likely to be the result of a number of intersecting and interlocking forces. With so many possible permutations of outcomes, each with ample Revisiting the Future opportunity for unintended consequences, there is a growing sense of insecurity. Even so,history may be more instructive than ever. While we continue to believe that the Great Depression is not likely to be repeated, the lessons to be drawn from that period include the harmful effects on fledgling democracies and multiethnic societies (think Central Europe in 1920s and 1930s) and on thesustainability of multilateral institutions (think League of Nations in the same period). There is no reason to think that this would not be true in the twenty-first as much as in the twentieth century. For that reason, the ways in which the potential for greater conflict could grow would seem to be even more apt in a constantly volatile economic environment as they would be if change would be steadier. In surveying those risks, the report stressed the likelihood that terrorism and nonproliferation will remain priorities even as resource issues move up on the international agenda. Terrorism’s appeal will decline if economic growth continues in the Middle East and youth unemployment is reduced. For those terrorist groups that remain active in 2025, however, the diffusion of technologies and scientific knowledge will place some of the world’s most dangerous capabilities within their reach. Terrorist groups in 2025 will likely be a combination of descendants of long established groups_inheriting organizational structures, command and control processes, and training procedures necessary to conduct sophisticated attacks_and newly emergent collections of the angry and disenfranchised that become self-radicalized, particularly in the absence of economic outlets that would become narrower in an economic downturn. The most dangerous casualty of any economically-induced drawdown of U.S. military presence would almost certainly be the Middle East. Although Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is not inevitable, worries about a nuclear-armed Iran couldlead states in the region to develop new security arrangements with external powers, acquire additional weapons, and consider pursuing their own nuclear ambitions. It is not clear that the type of stable deterrent relationship that existed between the great powers for most of the Cold War would emerge naturally in the Middle East with a nuclear Iran. Episodes of low intensity conflict and terrorism taking place under a nuclear umbrella could lead to an unintended escalation and broader conflict if clear red lines between those states involved are not well established. The close proximity of potential nuclear rivalscombined with underdeveloped surveillance capabilities and mobile dual-capable Iranian missile systems also will produce inherent difficulties in achieving reliable indications and warning of an impending nuclear attack. The lack of strategic depth in neighboring states like Israel, short warning and missile flight times, and uncertaintyof Iranian intentions may place more focus on preemption rather than defense, potentially leading to escalating crises. 36 Types of conflict that the world continues to experience, such as over resources, could reemerge, particularly if protectionism grows and there is a resort to neo-mercantilist practices. Perceptions of renewed energy scarcity will drive countries to take actions to assure their future access to energy supplies. In the worst case, this could result in interstate conflicts if government leaders deem assured access to energy resources, for example, to be essential for maintaining domestic stability and the survival of their regime. Even actions short of war, however, will have important geopolitical implications. Maritime security concerns are providing a rationale for naval buildups and modernization efforts, such as China’s and India’s development of blue water naval capabilities. If the fiscal stimulus focus for thesecountries indeed turns inward, one of the most obvious funding targets may be military. Buildup of regional naval capabilities could lead to increased tensions, rivalries, and counterbalancing moves, but it also will create opportunities for multinational cooperation in protecting critical sea lanes.With water also becoming scarcer in Asia and the Middle East, cooperation to manage changing water resources is likely to be increasingly difficult both within and between states in a more dog-eat-dog world.<br />

<br />
Last week's attack on Yeonpyeong island, a senior South Korean defence official told The Daily Telegraph, was personally approved by North Korea's supreme leader, Kim Jong-il and his son and heir-apparent Kim Jong-un, in an effort to curry favour with hostile military hawks. &quot;I fear we're going to see much more fighting in weeks to come,&quot; the official said. Hardship has mounted in North Korea ever since sanctions were imposed to punish its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Hundreds of North Korean soldiers are reported to have fled across the border into China seeking food in recent months. In August, a North Korean pilot's attempt to escape to Russia ended when his jet crashed in China's Liaoning province. But Kim Jong-il, US government sources said, is determined not to rejoin talks aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear programme in return for aid, fearful of upsetting military leaders. He hopes precipitating a crisis will lead the generals to rally behind his son and compel South Korea and the West to engage in dialogue on his terms. Kim Jong-un was made a four-star general and named vice-chairman of the country's National Defence Commission in September – even though the Swiss-educated 27-year-old had no military experience. &quot;The generals saw Kim Jong-un as a puppy who wasn't even lavatory trained,&quot; said Kongdan Oh Hassig, a North Korea expert, &quot;not a credible leader. There was lots of fuming.&quot; Bruce Bennett, another North Korea specialist, said the succession left generals &quot;asking themselves how much longer they would have a role in government&quot;. He noted that replacements of officials in North Korea &quot;usually occur as the result of a purge or a 'traffic accident,' so that could be cause for some instability.&quot; &quot;Every time there's been a succession in North Korea,&quot; Dr. Hassig noted, &quot;you've had trouble, because the leadership has needed to reassure the military.&quot; Kim Jong-il ordered the bombing of a Korean Air plane in 1987, killing all 115, and an attack on officials which left 17 dead. Little noticed in the West, tensions with the military have often threatened North Korea's ruling family. In 1991-1992, there were reports that a group of generals had been planning to assassinate Kim Il-sung, in order to implement a programme of radical modernisation. Later, in 1995, elements of North Korea's VI corps in famine-hit North Hamgyong province almost revolted. &quot;The Kims are playing the Crazed Fearsome Cripple Gambit,&quot; a US military official told The Daily Telegraph, referring to a term coined by the strategic analyst George Friedman. North Korea's regime, Mr Friedman argued, wilfully chose to be an economically-crippled state to make itself unattractive as a target for intervention. Then it sought to inspire fear by developing nuclear weapons. Finally, Mr Friedman argued, &quot;having established that they were crippled and fearsome, the critical element was to establish their insanity&quot;. Since no one would wish for a nuclear-armed North Korea to engage in a crazed military adventure, it would give the regime what it wanted. Both Koreas are now holding out threats of further fighting. North Korea's official news agency warned on Saturday that the &quot;situation on the Korean peninsula is inching closer to the brink of war&quot;. Lieutenant General Yoo Nak Joon, commander of the South Korean Marine Corps, meanwhile, called on his troops to &quot;put our feelings of rage and animosity in our bones and take our revenge on North Korea&quot;.<br />

<br />
North Korea has established an independent military division responsible for controlling and deploying its intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs).[1] Known as the Musudan,[2] these IRBMs are a strategic-level asset controlled by the senior leadership. Little is known about the missile, but U.S. assessments consider it to be a single-stage, road-mobile IRBM with a range of 1,800 to 3,000 miles--capable of targeting U.S. military bases in Japan, Okinawa, and Guam.[3] Twelve of these missiles were reportedly displayed in an April 2007 military parade in Pyongyang. A Musudan test flight from a North Korean test facility has not been identified, but media reports citing military and intelligence sources indicate a possible North Korean test flight in Iran in 2006. An Increasing Threat The South Korean Ministry of Defense assessed that Musudan missiles were first deployed in 2007.[4] It is likely that only a limited number of these missiles were actually deployed, representing initial operating capability. However, the creation of a new IRBM missile command suggests that the missile has now been deployed in greater numbers and has reached full operational capability. Deployment of a new military capability, as opposed to augmentation of an existing capability, often requires changes in military doctrine, strategy, and unit structure (known as a &quot;table of organization and equipment&quot;). The creation of a new military command structure indicates that North Korea continues to increase its missile threat to the United States and its allies. Deployment of the Musudan enables Pyongyang to attack staging bases for U.S. forces responding to North Korean provocations or hostilities. For example, U.S. air and naval forces in Japan, Okinawa, and Guam would provide extensive support to South Korean military units in the initial stages of a North Korean attack on the South. The U.S. Marine Corps Third Marine Expeditionary Force on Okinawa provides a critical ground force component to combined U.S. and South Korean operational war plans. The Musudan missile augments the existing deployed threat of 600 North Korean SCUD short-range ballistic missiles that threaten South Korea and 300 No Dong medium-range ballistic missiles capable of striking all of Japan. North Korea is also continuing development of the Taepo Dong intercontinental ballistic missile, which, when completed, could threaten the continental United States with a nuclear weapon--a Taepo Dong-2 missile flew 2,300 miles during an April 2009 test flight.<br />

The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community. At worst, there is the possibility of nuclear attack1, whether by intention, miscalculation, or merely accident, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions. But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow...The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger...To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4 These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. The direct impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis pale by comparison. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community.<br />

Scenario #5: A rogue leader wants to attack the United States but evade retaliation. Iran, which the 1998 Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States (the Rumsfeld Commission) reported &quot;has the technical capability and resources to demonstrate an ICBM-range ballistic missile...within five years of the decision to deploy,&quot; decides to take hostile action against the United States after developing an ICBM.7 It knows that a direct nuclear attack on the United States would result in the destruction of Tehran.8 It launches two missiles with nuclear warheads that detonate 250 miles above Illinois and Wyoming. The United States does not retaliate because no one is immediately killed. Not knowing whether Iran has other nuclear warheads, the United States decides to limit its response against Iran rather than risk a direct nuclear attack on a U.S. city.<br />

Defense: Tehran's navy deploys ships to the Atlantic capable of launching long-range missiles. This is not a joke. This is a dress rehearsal for the day an EMP attack ends our way of life. 'Is it possible for us to witness a world without America and Zionism?&quot; Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked at &quot;The World Without Zionism&quot; Tehran conference in 2005. &quot;But you had best know that this slogan and this goal are attainable, and surely can be achieved.&quot; He added that Iran had a &quot;war preparation plan&quot; for, as he put it, &quot;the destruction of Anglo-Saxon civilization.&quot; Electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, is not a subject familiar to most Americans. But it's quite familiar to the Iranian military. It's been practicing for the day when an Iranian missile tipped with a nuclear warhead lifts off from a vessel parked in international waters off our shores, the warhead detonating high above the American heartland, sending electromagnetic waves rippling across the American landscape, frying every electronic circuit within range. In a July 18 statement, Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari said the Iranian navy plans on deploying warships in the Atlantic Ocean as part of a program to ply international waters. Two days later, another Iranian rear admiral, Seyed Mahmoud Mousavi, revealed for the first time that his navy has equipped a number of its logistic vessels and units with long-range missiles. The squadron will be equipped with the Nur missile, which is based on China's long-range Silkworm C-802 anti-ship cruise missile and has a 125-mile range and 365-pound warhead. It is not these ships and their missiles that threaten us, but what comes later as they use these forays to gain experience operating far from Iranian shores. Subscribe to the IBD Editorials Podcast A simple Scud missile, with a nuclear warhead, could be fired from an inconspicuous freighter in international waters off our coast and detonated high over the U.S. It would wreak devastation on America's technological, electrical and transportation infrastructure. Masked as a terrorist attack, Iran would have plausible deniability of any responsibility. Iran has practiced launching and detonating Scuds in midflight, launched from ships in the Caspian Sea. It's also tested high-altitude explosions of its Shahab-3 ballistic missile, a test consistent with an EMP attack. The warhead need not be of a staggeringly high yield — nor must the missile have an intercontinental range. &quot;One nightmare scenario posed,&quot; according to Peter Vincent Pry, an expert on EMP who sits on a congressional panel looking into the threat of such a weapon, &quot;was a ship-launched EMP attack against the U.S. by Iran, as this would eliminate the need for Iran to develop an ICBM to deliver a nuclear warhead against the U.S. and could be executed clandestinely, taking the U.S. by surprise.&quot;<br />

For all the reasons outlined earlier, however, Iran has other capabilities to strike back against Israel. In fact, it has threatened retaliation if attacked by Israel. Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki was quoted as saying that an attack by Israel or the United States would have ―severe consequence,‖ and threatened that Iran would retaliate ―by all means‖ at its disposal. Mottaki added, ―Iran does not think that the Zionist regime is in a condition to engage in such a dangerous venture and they know how severe the possible Iranian response will be to its possible audacity […] Suffice to say that the Zionist regime, if they attack, will regret it.‖xlii On May 17, 2009, the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Mohamed ElBaradei, called any possible Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities an &quot;insane&quot; move. ―Attacking Iran would be insane,‖ ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told Der Spiegel, and added that ―this would trigger an explosion across the whole region and the Iranians would immediately start to construct a (nuclear) bomb and would be assured the support of the entire Muslim world.‖xliii Iran has several options in responding to an Israeli attack: Multiple launches of Shahab-3 including the possibility of CBR warheads against Tel Aviv, Israeli military and civilian centers, and Israeli suspected nuclear weapons sites. Using proxy groups such Hezbollah or Hamas to attack Israel proper with suicide bombings, covert CBR attacks, and missile attacks from southern Lebanon and Syria. Covert attacks against Israeli interests by its intelligence and IRGC assets. This could include lowlevel bombings against Israeli embassies, Jewish centers, and other Israeli assets outside and inside Israel. Use of ―suicide drone‖ UAVs possibly armed with CBR munitions against Israel overtly or through proxy groups such as Hezbollah. In addition, most Israeli military options would have to include an air strike that involved overflights of Arab territory that might seriously complicate Israel's fragile relations with Jordan and may provoke Saudi Arabia to respond. An Israeli strike against Iranian nuclear facilities may also strengthen the Iranian regime's stance to move toward nuclear capabilities and drive many neighboring states to support Iran's bid for nuclear weapons. In addition, it could lead to further escalation of the Iraqi insurgency and increase the threat of asymmetric attacks against American interests and allies in the region. On the other hand, Israeli officials have expressed the concern that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them, this could spark further proliferation in the region. This would spread WMD capabilities around the Middle East and greatly increase the threat of CBRN attacks against Israel and the entire region. Waiting also has its penalties.<br />

4. Global nuclear war*<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, the existence of an arsenal of mass destruction in such an unstable region in turn has serious implications for future arms control and disarmament negotiations, and even the threat of nuclear war. Seymour Hersh warns, &quot;Should war break out in the Middle East again,... or should any Arab nation fire missiles against Israel, as the Iraqis did, a nuclear escalation, once unthinkable except as a last resort, would now be a strong probability.&quot;(41) and Ezar Weissman, Israel's current President said &quot;The nuclear issue is gaining momentum (and the) next war will not be conventional.&quot;(42) Russia and before it the Soviet Union has long been a major (if not the major) target of Israeli nukes. It is widely reported that the principal purpose of Jonathan Pollard's spying for Israel was to furnish satellite images of Soviet targets and other super sensitive data relating to U.S. nuclear targeting strategy. (43) (Since launching its own satellite in 1988, Israel no longer needs U.S. spy secrets.) Israeli nukes aimed at the Russian heartland seriously complicate disarmament and arms control negotiations and, at the very least, the unilateral possession of nuclear weapons by Israel is enormously destabilizing, and dramatically lowers the threshold for their actual use, if not for all out nuclear war. In the words of Mark Gaffney, &quot;... if the familar pattern(Israel refining its weapons of mass destruction with U.S. complicity) is not reversed soon- for whatever reason- the deepening Middle East conflict could trigger a world conflagration.&quot;<br />

<br />
Ba’athist Iraq’s war-weary population was likewise subject to massive and—let’s face it—masterful propaganda. Hitting the hated Israelis, even with ineffective weapons, and the fact that due to US political pressure the Israelis did not strike back, was seen by Iraqis and by other Arabs as a great victory. A claim made explicit in a memoir written by Saddam’s missile force commander Hazim Abd al-Razzaq al-Ayyubi Forty-Three Missiles on the Zionist Enemy published in Amman, Jordan in 1998. Al-Ayyubi described how, in the years and months leading up to the war, his two missile brigades practiced their “shoot and scoot” operational techniques. He also wrote about the very serious efforts the Iraqis made building multiple secure communications links using both radio and phone lines. According to a report to Saddam, they started the war with 230 missiles and 75 “special” warheads. Interestingly, he also bragged about the success of his deception units, not only in fooling US and Coalition targeting efforts, but also in deceiving the UN inspectors who tried to account for the missiles. Wood makes it clear “that despite the cost to the Iraqi people, Iraq’s successful violation of UNSC [United Nations Security Council] resolution 687 was a source of great pride to its leaders.” Most, but not all, of what the Iraqis believed they had accomplished with their attacks was nonsense. The claims that they hit Ben Gurion Airport and the Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv, or the Haifa Technology Institute, are just not serious. As was their claim to have been “the first Arab country to conduct effective offensive operations against the enemy (Israel).” What is true is that these attacks “fulfilled the Iraqi President’s vow that he would retaliate against Israel as revenge for their attacks against the Iraqi reactor.” It is exactly this need for revenge that should get the attention of those in the US government who are trying to design a realistic missile defense policy for the next fifty years. Tyrannical regimes and terrorist movements share the need to excite people with dramatic and violent events. The more spectacular the attack, the better. Firing long-range missiles at an enemy, even if you only hit an empty parking lot, can provide followers with a level of emotional satisfaction. This in turn can motivate them to continue to fight even in a seemingly hopeless battle. In future wars, those who are fighting against the West—today Iran or North Korea, tomorrow, who knows?—will use ballistic missiles not only to terrorize enemy civilian populations but to build morale among their own forces and people. Missile defense is the key to winning this critical psychological battle. As long as their missiles are being shot out of the sky, claims that they are hurting the enemy and thus filling people’s need for revenge can be shown to be utterly empty. This, however, cannot be done with terminal phase defense weapons. To hit a missile or a warhead that is descending towards its target may be a feat of technological skill, but it does nothing to decrease the emotional satisfaction that comes from striking a hated enemy. Midcourse interceptors such as the US GBI or the Israeli Arrow are better, but the best way to publicly humiliate those who are launching Scud-type missiles is to shoot them down as soon after they leave the launch pad as possible. The only weapon now in development that will—in theory—be able to do this is the Airborne Laser (ABL), which the Missile Defense Agency plans to test next year. This is indeed a promising system, but it has its limits. Its range is, according to unclassified reports, about 300 kilometers, and the US only plans to build, at most, seven aircraft. If the goal is to prevent the enemy from using its missile attacks to build its own side’s morale and thus lengthen the war, another solution must be found. Space-based interceptors, such as a new version of the Brilliant Pebbles program that was canceled in 1993, could, in combination with space- and ground-based sensors, knock down missiles of this type in the boost phase. Significantly, they would do so over the launching country’s own territory and at least some of the citizens would witness the destruction of their leader’s vengeance weapons. This news would spread through word of mouth. This might be one of the keys to undermining their will to make war and help shorten the conflict.<br />

<br />
A global layered defense capability is necessary to counter these threats. Near-term options exist for augmenting sea-based defenses and deploying space-based defenses within the next decade, resulting in a comprehensive, global layered missile defense system. Layered defenses provide multiple opportunities to destroy attacking missiles in all three phas¬es of flight from any direction regardless of their geograph¬ic starting point. Furthermore, a layered defense makes the countermeasures available to the offensive systems much less effective than would be the case if interdiction was only possible in one (or two) phase(s) of the missile’s flight. Boost-phase intercepts, most efficiently conducted by components deployed in space, are particularly desirable because a mis¬sile is most vulnerable during this segment since it is rel¬atively slow moving, presents a readily identifiable target (bright rocket plume), and has not released any of its war¬heads or countermeasures that would complicate intercep¬tion in subsequent phases. Boost-phase interception has the added advantage that the missile’s payload may, depending on how early interdiction occurs, fall back on the attack¬ing nation. This situation could deter the launching state if it is confronted with the likelihood of serious damage to its own territory. In addition, depending on the number of assets deployed, a space-based boost-phase defense could always be on station on a world-wide basis, unfettered by sovereignty issues of overflight and operations on another nation’s territory. Layered defenses that include space-based interceptors might also dissuade adversaries in possession of ballistic missiles, or would-be possessors, from seeking costly in¬ vestments to acquire ballistic missiles that could not easi¬ly penetrate such a defensive shield. As a result, the United States would retain maximum flexibility in a crisis situa¬tion in which the threat of ballistic missile attacks would be minimized. In order to build a global layered missile de¬fense, the United States must take several important steps in parallel.<br />

There was. For some 16 months, NASA had been explor¬ing with SDIO possibilities of using DoD technologies in its space exploration program. So that early in 1992, SDIO for¬mulated the concept for a space probe mission based on Brilliant Pebbles technologies. In addition to NASA, the Na¬val Research Laboratory provided the spacecraft and overall system integration, and Lawrence Livermore National Lab¬oratory provided the sensors, propulsion, computers, and the like, using hardware gathered up from Brilliant Pebbles demonstration programs that it was handling. The mission: return to the moon, map its surface, fly by the Earth and slingshot past a near-Earth asteroid (Geogra¬phos) on a planned near-miss and continue out into deep space. Hence the space probe’s name, Clementine (“lost and gone forever,” per the old ballad). Authorized in the waning days of the Bush-41 administration, preparations were al¬lowed to continue under the new Clinton administration, so that the Clementine mission was launched aboard a Titan II rocket on January 25, 1994, and was completed in August. What, then, was the mission performance outcome? While it was unable to complete the asteroid flyby, Clem¬entine was “spectacularly successful” in the lunar portion of its mission, completing about 350 lunar orbits in two months and taking almost 1.8 million multi-spectral imag¬es of the moon (using 15 spectral bands). Clementine was the first high-fidelity photometric survey of an extraterres¬trial body and its data indicated the existence of water at the lunar poles. It delivered more data and more informa¬tion than the entire Apolloprogram, with a total mission program cost of $80 million. The small mission team won awards from NASA and the National Academy of Sciences, and results of the surveys and mission were widely (and fa¬vorably) reported. A replica of Clementine now hangs in a place of honor in the Smithsonian. In terms of the missionperformance of Brilliant Pebbles technologies, everything worked. As Baucom records: Clementine served as a highly successful test bed for twenty-three lightweight SDI technologies, all of which performed properly. A number of these technologies were directly related to the Brilliant Pebbles program. Specifically, Clementine’s cam¬eras and sensors had been developed for BP. Cle¬mentine also verified the autonomous operational mode that was to have been employed with Bril¬liant Pebbles... [and] lent support to the philoso¬phy that had initially guided the Brilliant Pebbles development and acquisition process – the maxi¬mum use of commercial off-the-shelf components and a minimum reliance on hardware designed to military specifications. Thus, the by-product of the Clementine mission was to space-qualify all of the first generation of Brilliant Pebbles tech¬nologies, except for the miniature propulsion elements for the space interceptor, which were subsequently tested with “very efficient” results in the Astrid launch experiment in February 1994, thus completing the qualification requirements.19 Clementine notwithstanding, the stop-work order issued approximately five months earlier on Brilliant Pebbles and other space-related projects continued the dismantling pro¬cess without interruption. Little, if any, of the SBI technol¬ogies survived – not even for use in the land-based system which SDIO had been working on per instructions from Congress. It was to have been an agile, fast, and lightweight land-based interceptor to harmonize with other GPALS components for a layered defense and thus drew heavily on these technologies (most of which Clementine had proved); known as the GBI-X KV, it was to weigh about 20 kilograms (44 pounds) but was abruptly cancelled.20<br />

During the past two decades, this technology has advanced considerably in areas such as power, beam control, and pointing and tracking techniques which enables the system to hit a target at great ranges.57 This energy can be used to engage satellites, aircraft, and vehicles, but the most promising aspect of this technology is the ability to destroy missiles traveling at mach or supersonic speeds. In addition to being able to being able to engage rapidly moving targets,lasers can be re-directed by mirrors to hit these targets that fall outside of line-of-sight range. This all can be donewithoutcompromising much of the beam’s initial power.58 The unique attributes of lasers has the potential to revolutionize missile defense operations.Those attributes include: 1. Speed of Light Capability: This represents a core significant advantage of lasers.With the potential to travel at 186,000 miles per second, directed energy offers the warfighter near-instantaneous options to destroy targets at great distances. Quite naturally, this attribute also greatly simplifies tracking and targeting of missiles while also greatly reducing target counter-measure techniques. 2. Precise and Adjustable Targeting: Directed energy offers extremely precise targeting effects, which are capable of delivering energy to a small spot on a missile. This phenomenon would cause a missile to undergo aerodynamic stress which would lead to catastrophic failure. A related feature of this characteristic is the ability to adjust the amount of energy required to successfully propagate through the atmosphere from surface locations. The free-electron laser is the only form of directed energy that has demonstrated that capability. 3. Affordability: Once deployed, lasers will be able to intercept missiles at relatively low costs per shot. Although the beam-generating system may be initially expensive to build and 15maintain, the price per engagement will be relatively cheap as compared to conventional systems.59 For example, the Missile Defense Agency conducted a missile intercept experiment back in December of 2008using a kinetic energy intercept vehicle. The total cost of the experiment ranged between $120 million and $150 million, although the Agency did employ several other defense systems to ensure a successful intercept.60 Navy surveillance ships and space-based command and control platforms provided a robust network for the experiment that assisted with launch intercept. 4. Repetitive Engagements: Laser have a great capacity for continuous engagements over an extended period of time,and are constrained only by the availability of power and the need to vent energy producing by-products such as heat. Conventional weapons, especially those firing precision-guided munitions, are constrained in the number of engagements it can execute. In additionto engaging threats,lasers can be used to detect, image, track, and illuminate targets. This process can work autonomously with the “kill laser” while also enabling the platform to lock onto a multiple number of missiles. 5. Weapon System Diversity: Directed energy systems can be placed on a variety of platforms to achieve optimum results.Airborne lasers are capable of attacking targets out to several hundred kilometers, while a ground-based platform could attack targets on a global scale.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is the second of two scenarios that consider how </span>U.S. space weapons might create incentives for America’s opponents to behave in dangerous ways.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The previous scenario looked at the systemic risk of accidents that could arise from keeping nuclear weapons on high alert to guard against a space weapons attack. This section focuses on the risk that </span>a single accident in space,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> such as </span>a piece of space debris striking a Russian early-warning satellite, might be the catalyst for an accidental nuclear war<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As we have noted in an earlier section, the United States canceled its own ASAT program in the 1980s over concerns that the deployment of these weapons might be deeply destabilizing. For all the talk about a “new relationship” between the United States and Russia, both sides retain thousands of nuclear forces on alert and configured to fight a nuclear war. When briefed about the size and status of U.S. nuclear forces, President George W. Bush reportedly asked “What do we need all these weapons for?”43 The answer, as it was during the Cold War, is that the forces remain on alert to conduct a number of possible contingencies, including a nuclear strike against Russia. This fact, of course, is not lost on the Rus- sian leadership, which has been increasing its reliance on nuclear weapons to compensate for the country’s declining military might. In the mid-1990s, Russia dropped its pledge to refrain from the “first use” of nuclear weapons and conducted a series of exercises in which Russian nuclear forces prepared to use nuclear weapons to repel a NATO invasion. In October 2003, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov reiter- ated that Moscow might use nuclear weapons “preemptively” in any number of contingencies, including a NATO attack.44 So, it remains business as usual with U.S. and Russian nuclear forces. And business as usual includes the occasional false alarm of a nuclear attack. There have been several of these incidents over the years. In September 1983, as a relatively new Soviet early-warning satellite moved into position to monitor U.S. missile fields in North Dakota, the sun lined up in just such a way as to fool the Russian satellite into reporting that half a dozen U.S. missiles had been launched at the Soviet Union. Perhaps mindful that a brand new satel- lite might malfunction, the officer in charge of the command center that monitored data from the early-warning satellites refused to pass the alert to his superiors. He reportedly explained his caution by saying: “When people start a war, they don’t start it with only five missiles. You can do little damage with just five missiles.”45 In January 1995, Norwegian scientists launched a sounding rocket on a trajectory similar to one that a U.S. Trident missile might take if it were launched to blind Russian radars with a high26 What if Space Were Weaponized? altitude nuclear detonation. The incident was apparently serious enough that, the next day, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated that he had activated his “nuclear football” – a device that allows the Russian president to communicate with his military advisors and review his options for launching his arsenal. In this case, the Russian early-warning satellites could clearly see that no attack was under way and the crisis passed without incident.46 In both cases, Russian observers were confi- dent that what appeared to be a “small” attack was not a fragmentary picture of a much larger one. In the case of the Norwegian sounding rocket, space-based sensors played a crucial role in assuring the Russian leadership that it was not under attack. The Russian command sys- tem, however, is no longer able to provide such reliable, early warning. The dissolution of the Soviet Union cost Moscow several radar stations in newly independent states, creating “attack corridors” through which Moscow could not see an attack launched by U.S. nuclear submarines.47 Further, Russia’s constellation of early-warn- ing satellites has been allowed to decline – only one or two of the six satellites remain operational, leaving Russia with early warning for only six hours a day. </span>Russia is attempting to reconstitute its constellation of early-warning satellites,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with several launches planned in the next few years. </span>But Russia will still have limited warning and will depend heavily on<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its </span>space-based systems to provide warning of an American attack<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.48 As the previous section explained, the Pentagon is contemplating military missions in space that will improve U.S. ability to cripple Russian nuclear forces in a crisis before they can execute an attack on the United States. Anti-satellite weapons, in this scenario, would blind Russian reconnaissance and warning satellites and knock out communications satellites. Such strikes might be the prelude to a full-scale attack, or a limited ef- fort, as attempted in a war game at Schriever Air Force Base, to conduct “early deterrence strikes” to signal U.S. resolve and control escalation.49 By 2010, the United States may, in fact, have an arsenal of ASATs (perhaps even on orbit 24/7) ready to conduct these kinds of missions – to coerce opponents and, if necessary, support preemptive attacks. Moscow would certainly have to worry that these ASATs could be used in conjunction with other space-enabled systems – for example, long-range strike systems that could attack targets in less than 90 minutes – to disable Russia’s nuclear deterrent before the Rus- sian leadership understood what was going on. </span>What would happen if a piece of space debris were to disable a Russian early-warning satellite<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> under these conditions? Could the Russian military distinguish between an accident in space and the first phase of a U.S. attack? Most Russian early-warning satellites are in elliptical Molniya orbits (a few are in GEO) and thus difficult to attack from the ground or air. At a minimum, Moscow would probably have some tactical warn- ing of such a suspicious launch, but given the sorry state of Russia’s warning, optical imaging and signals intelligence satellites there is reason to ask the question. Further, the advent of U.S. on-orbit ASATs, as now envisioned50 could make both the more difficult orbital plane and any warning systems moot. The unpleasant truth is that the </span>Russians<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> likely </span>would have to make a judgment call<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. No state has the ability to definitively deter- mine the cause of the satellite’s failure. Even the United States does not maintain (nor is it likely to have in place by 2010) a sophisticated space surveillance system that would allow it to distin- guish between a satellite malfunction, a debris strike or a deliberate attack – and Russian space surveillance capabilities are much more limited by comparison.</span> Even the risk assessments for col- lision with debris are speculative, particularly for the unique orbits in which Russian early-warning satellites operate.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> During peacetime, it is easy to imagine that the Russians would conclude that the loss of a satellite was either a malfunction or a debris strike. But how confident could U.S. planners be that the Russians would be so calm if the accident in space occurred in tandem with a second false alarm, or occurred during the middle of a crisis? </span>What might happen if the debris strike occurred shortly after a false alarm<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> showing a missile launch? </span>False alarms are appallingly common<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – according to information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command </span>(NORAD) experienced 1,172 “moderately serious” false alarms between 1977 and 1983 – an average of almost three false alarms per week. Comparable information is not available about the Russian system, but there is no reason to believe that it is any more reliable.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">51 Assessing the likelihood of these sorts of co- incidences is difficult because Russia has never provided data about the frequency or duration of false alarms; nor indicated how seriously early- warning data is taken by Russian leaders. More- over, there is no reliable estimate of the debris risk for Russian satellites in highly elliptical orbits.52 The important point, however, is that such a coincidence would only appear suspicious if the United States were in the business of disabling satellites – in other words, there is much less risk if Washington does not develop ASATs. The loss of an early-warning satellite could look rather ominous if it occurred during a period of major tension in the relationship. While NATO no longer sees Russia as much of a threat, the same cannot be said of the converse. Despite the warm talk, Russian leaders remain wary of NATO expansion, particularly the effect expansion may have on the Baltic port of Kaliningrad. Although part of Russia, Kaliningrad is separated from the rest of Russia by Lithuania and Poland. Russia has already complained about its decreasing lack of access to the port, particularly the uncooperative attitude of the Lithuanian govern- ment.53 News reports suggest that an edgy Russia may have moved tactical nuclear weapons into the enclave.54 If the Lithuanian government were to close access to Kaliningrad in a fit of pique, this would trigger a major crisis between NATO and Russia. Under these circumstances, </span>the loss of an early-warning satellite would be extremely suspicious. It is any military’s nature during a crisis to interpret events in their worst-case light.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For ex- ample, consider the coincidences that occurred in early September 1956, during the extraordinarily tense period in international relations marked by the Suez Crisis and Hungarian uprising.55 On one evening the White House received messages indicating: 1. the Turkish Air Force had gone on alert in response to unidentified aircraft penetrating its airspace; 2. one hundred Soviet MiG-15s were flying over Syria; 3. a British Canberra bomber had been shot down over Syria, most likely by a MiG; and 4. The Russian fleet was moving through the Dardanelles. Gen. Andrew Accidental Nuclear War Scenarios 27 28 What if Space Were Weaponized? Goodpaster was reported to have worried that the confluence of events “might trigger off ... the NATO operations plan” that called for a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union. Yet, all of these reports were false. The “jets” over Turkey were a flock of swans; the Soviet MiGs over Syria were a smaller, routine escort returning the president from a state visit to Moscow; the bomber crashed due to mechanical difficulties; and the Soviet fleet was beginning long-scheduled exercises. In an important sense, these were not “coincidences” but rather different manifestations of a common failure – human error resulting from extreme tension of an international crisis. As one author noted, “The detection and misinterpretation of these events, against the context of world tensions from Hungary and Suez, was the first major example of how the size and complexity of worldwide electronic warning systems could, at certain critical times, create momentum of its own.” Perhaps most worrisome, </span>the United States might be blithely unaware of the degree to which the Russians were concerned about its actions and inadvertently escalate a crisis.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> During the early 1980s, the Soviet Union suffered a major “war scare” during which time its leadership concluded that bilateral relations were rapidly declining. This war scare was driven in part by the rhetoric of the Reagan administration, fortified by the selective reading of intelligence. During this period, NATO conducted a major command post exercise, Able Archer, that caused some elements of the Soviet military to raise their alert status. American officials were stunned to learn, after the fact, that the Kremlin had been acutely nervous about an American first strike during this period.56 All of these incidents have a common theme – that confidence is often the difference between war and peace. </span>In times of crisis, false alarms can have a momentum of their own<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As in the second scenario in this monograph, the lesson is that commanders rely on the steady flow of reliable information. </span>When that information flow is disrupted – whether by a deliberate attack or an accident – confidence collapses and the result is panic and escalation. Introducing ASAT weapons into this mix is all the more dangerous, because such weapons target the elements of the command system that keep leaders aware, informed and in control.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As a result</span>, the mere presence of such weapons is corrosive to the confidence that allows national nuclear forces to operate safely.<br />

<strong>US-Russia war is the only existential risk to humanity – smaller wars don’t lead to extinction</strong><br />

<span class="underline">A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that might have been</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> persistent enough to qualify as global and </span><span class="underline">terminal. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization.[4] Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Unfortunately, we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">President Obama and Russian President Dimitri Medvedev are scheduled to Wednesday in London during the G-20 summit. They must not let the current economic crisis keep them from focusing on one of the greatest threats confronting humanity: the danger of nuclear war. </span>Since the end of the Cold War, many have acted as though the danger of nuclear war has ended. It has not. There remain in the world more than 20,000 nuclear weapons. Alarmingly, more than 2,000 of these weapons in the U.S. and Russian arsenals remain on ready-alert status, commonly known as hair-trigger alert.They can be fired within five minutes and reach targets in the other country 30 minutes later. Just one of these weapons can destroy a city. A war involving a substantial number would cause devastation on a scale unprecedented in human history.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A study conducted by Physicians for Social Responsibility in 2002 showed that if only 500 of the Russian weapons on high alert exploded over our cities, </span><span style="background-color: lime;">100 million Americans would die in the first 30 minutes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. An attack of </span><span style="background-color: lime;">this</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">magnitude also </span><span style="background-color: lime;">would destroy the entire economic, communications and transportation infrastructure on which we all depend. Those who survived the initial attack would inhabit a nightmare landscape with huge swaths of the country blanketed with radioactive fallout and epidemic diseases rampant</span><span style="background-color: lime; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="background-color: lime;">They would have no food, no fuel, no electricity, no medicine, and certainly no organized health care.</span> In the following months it is likely the vast majority of the U.S. population would die<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Recent studies by the eminent climatologists Toon and Robock have shown that such a war would have a huge and immediate impact on climate world wide. If all of the warheads in the U.S. and </span>Russian strategic arsenals were drawn into the conflict, the firestorms they caused would loft 180 million tons of soot and debris into the upper atmosphere — blotting out the sun. Temperatures across the globe would fall an average of 18 degrees Fahrenheit to levels not seen on earth since the depth of the last ice age, 18,000 years ago. Agriculture would stop, eco-systems would collapse, and many species, including perhaps our own, would become extinct. It is common to discuss nuclear war as a low-probabillity event.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But is this true? We know of five occcasions during the last 30 years when either the U.S. or Russia believed it was under attack and prepared a counter-attack. The most recent of these near misses occurred after the end of the Cold War on Jan. 25, 1995, when the Russians mistook a U.S. weather rocket launched from Norway for a possible attack. Jan. 25, 1995, was an ordinary day with no major crisis involving the U.S. and Russia. But, unknown to almost every inhabitant on the planet, a misunderstanding led to the potential for a nuclear war. The ready alert status of nuclear weapons that existed in 1995 remains in place today. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">WARNINGS Through </span>the US State Department<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the JSOC </span>issued about 1,000 warnings in 2010 to foreign governments that a space asset was at risk of collision.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Many of those resulted in avoidance manoeuvres, which consume propellant a satellite would normally use to maintain orientation. While some debris is an unavoidable consequence of launching a rocket, one senior US official says that &quot;</span>if we don't make some changes, we won't be able to use space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;. The USA, this official says, &quot;learned our lesson&quot; after a 1985 anti-satellite test left debris near the ISS. Stressing the need for all space-faring nations to take debris seriously, this official adds that China has behaved &quot;very irresponsibly but we are hopeful&quot;; a January 2011 &quot;missile defence&quot; test by the Chinese was followed within an hour by a statement assuring the world the incident was a test that left no debris. However, </span>the US position is that another two or three ASAT tests would threaten the use of low-Earth orbits<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The gravity of the issue has been highlighted by the European Commission, whose &quot;reinforced&quot; space policy calls for establishment of an autonomous European space situational awareness system to track debris and monitor solar weather, two hazards that cause E332 million ($480 million) in damage to European assets annually. What Europe is proposing is a system of comparable performance to what the USA is operating. Holger Krag, a space debris analyst at the European Space Agency's debris office, describes the ESA concept as a single radar installation somewhere in Europe supplemented by some 20 optical telescopes at four sites equally spaced near the Equator. The radar would be capable of tracking, and thus calculating the orbit of, objects of about 5cm size at altitudes around 800km, with capability decreasing with altitude; 10cm objects could be tracked at 1,200-1,300km and 30-40cm objects at 2,000km. However, radar cannot track objects at the 36,000km orbits of geosynchronous communications satellites, so to protect them the optical telescopes become necessary. Some space-based telescopes could ultimately be added to the system. Tracking capability gives spacecraft operators some warning of a collision, but Krag notes that </span>scarce resources have to be directed to averting &quot;catastrophic&quot; collisions that create more debris<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>A 1cm object carries enough energy to disable a satellite, but a 10cm object is powerful enough to break it apart, hence the focus on objects of this size or larger. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The ISS is unusual in being shielded against 1cm impacts, although Krag admits </span>there are larger objects that fall in the &quot;gap&quot; between what the ISS is protected against and the objects which can be detected.<br />

In 1969, considering the future of the U.S. space program, the Space Task Group noted the importance of international participation and communication. It believed </span><span class="Underline0">this would promote a sense of world community; optimize international scientific, technical, and economic participation; apply space technology to humanity’s needs; and share the benefits and costs of space research and exploration</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.16 These factors continue to drive international cooperation today. Even if increased cooperation is desirable and has been put into action during the construction phase, one may still question whether the ISS program is designed to promote future collaboration. In The Evolution of Cooperation by Robert Axelrod, an expert on strategic interactions</span>, two of the primary methods for promoting future partnerships include making interactions more durable and more frequent.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">17 </span><span class="Underline0">The ISS </span>does both.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It </span><span class="Underline0">is a highly visible, long-lasting program backed by international agreements, and therefore is more durable than other, less publicized or less formal international arrangements</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Due to the technological challenges involved in design, development, production, launch, and operation of so complex an orbital facility, frequent international interaction and iterative cooperation are essential. </span><span class="Underline0">Global cooperation on large-scale technical projects is a growing phenomenon, and the I</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nternational </span><span class="Underline0">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">pace </span><span class="Underline0">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tation </span><span class="Underline0">has been</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> studied as </span><span class="Underline0">a model for these types of partnerships</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.18 A great example is the 2008 integration of two international laboratories, the European Columbus lab and the Japanese Kibo lab, into the ISS. The Canadian Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator has been added, and both the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) have successfully performed servicing missions. </span><span class="Underline0">These</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> concrete </span><span class="Underline0">steps forward provide strong evidence that the program is succeeding</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.19 International partners place a great deal of importance in the ISS. The name of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s ( JAXA) laboratory Kibo means “hope” in Japanese. When the first module of the laboratory was delivered in March 2008, the Prime Minister of Japan hailed it as the beginning of Japan’s new “home in space.”20 </span><span class="Underline0">Each international partner mentions its participation in the ISS program as a major effort of its space program</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The JAXA vision statement, written in 2005, notes that participation </span><span class="Underline0">in the ISS program shows Japan’s status as an “equal partner with the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="Underline0">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span class="Underline0">and European countries” and establishes its status in the international community</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.21 Russian, European, and Japanese space policy documents all mention the importance of research done on the ISS to successful future human spaceflight missions.22 </span><span class="Underline0">If U.S. support for the ISS program lapses</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in 2015, </span><span class="Underline0">it is likely that one of the most significant negative impacts would be on international relations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="Underline0">andglobalperceptions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as to </span><span class="Underline0">whether or not the U.S. is a reliable partner.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Concern over U.S. intentions is already apparent. Even amid the excitement of the Kibo module being launched, an article was published in the Daily Yomiuri, an English-language online supplement to Japan’s largest selling newspaper, that warned people not to be overly optimistic.23 The article notes that the United States plans to shut down the ISS in 2015 and, if that happens, the Kibo laboratory will not be operational for the 10 years it was designed to last, in which case benefits from the project may be limited. The article highlights the risks of “international projects in cooperation with countries like the United States, where policies can change abruptly with the changing of administrations.” The article also says that Europe has engaged in diplomatic talks with Russia and the United States about the ISS, while Japan, “has relied almost completely on the United States, and has fallen behind Europe as a result.”24 At the 2009 Paris Air Show, international partners voiced their interest in continuing the ISS mission past 2015, possibly to 2025. European Space Agency partners noted that they have a strong desire to extend the program to fully exploit their Columbus science lab.25 The ramifications of a decision to withdraw from the ISS program in 2015 would, therefore, extend far beyond this single project. The United States’ choice to honor (or not) international commitments vis-à-vis the ISS will affect other countries’ views of the United States as a partner in virtually all future endeavors. </span><span class="Underline0">The ISS provides the opportunity to cement lasting partnerships and cooperation in many areas</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A unilateral U.S. decision to end the program against the wishes of the international partners will adversely affect future programs. </span>If the United States is unable to sustain its engagement with its international partners, it will either have to forgo future large-scale space programs, or undertake all costs on its own.</strong><br />

Scenario A: “Back to the Future” - “</span>Back to the Future” describes a future<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> characterized by a high degree of technological breakthrough </span>wherein power is projected by rule of force.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In 2009 </span>global tensions create an atmosphere where nations increasingly test new defensive tech<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nology. In 2010 </span>India explodes a satellite out of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Low-Earth orbit (</span>LEO<span style="font-size: 8pt;">) </span>and the US<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A </span>tests an orbital interceptor<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Gazprom invests $1 billion in the development of a nanotechnology research lab. </span>There is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span>a steady erosion of Outer Space Treaty norms and limits to protect commerce<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. By 2013 </span></strong>NATO is dissolved<strong>, seen as no longer relevant<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The EU alliance shifts towards defending its borders. </span>Human spaceflight continues<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>in a<span style="font-size: 8pt;">n increasingly </span>competitive atmosphere<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The USA launches Aries I, with a crew. Generation Y seems more interested in environmental issues than space. By 2014 </span>many nations begin deploying <span style="font-size: 8pt;">anti-satellite (</span>ASAT<span style="font-size: 8pt;">) </span>tech<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nology. In 2015 </span>China, the US<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A, </span>India and Russia</strong> field rival ASATs <strong>in orbit, as LEO orbits are at risk from debris<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Commercial interests give up on LEO and eye the Moon, which fuels the race to establish a presence there. An increasingly protectionist US<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A </span>leaves the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> World Trade Organization (</span></strong>WTO<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">). </span>In response, China recalls its debts from the US<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A. Meanwhile, European and Asian growth continues and, in 2018, a Chinese factory begins production of bulk carbon nanotubes. The USA and China race to produce the first space elevator. The civil lunar programs move forward. By 2020 a joint US–EU team land on and ‘reclaim’ the Moon. </span>Lunar bases<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the space elevator </span>are established, as resources continue to dwindle on earth. Rival moon bases compete over mining rights and orbital lasers promote a <span style="font-size: 8pt;">defensive</span></strong> arms race in space<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. NATO is replaced by a new European Defence Organization (EDO). A coalition emerges, including the USA, the EU and India, in opposition to Russia and China. By 2025 </span>African nations reject the influence of major powers and, thanks to the prolif<span style="font-size: 8pt;">eration </span>of tech<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nology, </span>become space powers in their own right<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In 2028 </span>major powers</strong> withdraw from the O<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uter</span></strong> S<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">pace</span></strong> T<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">reaty. Saudi oil fields are now officially empty, and the lunar colonies' major export is solar power. </span>Military bases on the Moon defend against rival solar farms<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>A Russian–Chinese coalition attacks the space elevator, which essentially strands the US–EU lunar colonies and seriously impairs energy availability on Earth<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The</strong> UN breaks down <strong>and is dismantled. Treaties are ignored and tensions increase. The earth is highly militarized, and</strong> conflict occurs both on earth and in space<strong>. The future is tense, dark and uncertain<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. By 2030 Californian scientists claim to have discovered an alleged artificial signal from outer space. The signal offers the possibility of a new reason for hope. 4.4. Group observations on Scenario A In this scenario technological breakthroughs add to the rule of force rather than providing a means for international cooperation. States come together and drift apart based on their perceived interests. The group acknowledged the importance of “giving teeth” to the Outer Space Treaty and other treaties in order to enhance means of overcoming conflict in the future. However, treaties do erode when states or blocs of states perceive these no longer to serve their interests. Further, norms of the Outer Space Treaty may be eroded through the commercialization of space, rather than by conflict and militarization. The group recognized that cooperation is possible on some, but not all, issues. Following the Chinese recent ASAT test there were efforts to clarify the situation for all parties concerned and prevent repeat occurrences. This suggests in part that the UN breaking down is not realistic, and that there might be greater political will to move in a collaborative direction than the scenario suggests. </span>The competition for resources breaks down liberal order and traps states into a situation where the rule of force is perceived as the only option<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this scenario democracies are not less likely to militarize. Politicians bear the responsibility for the implications of their actions. NASA remains a remnant of the Cold War, while the EU space plan is geared towards a broader array of concerns. The voice of civil society is then squashed. (There is also an option of a scenario where, instead of the EU, China becomes a regional champion, bringing other regional leaders like Brazil under a new transparent framework.) The rule of force is also justified for the protection of investments. An entity such as the US-Soviet Standing Consultative Commission (SCC), which was convened when one side thought there had been a violation by the other, might be helpful. Driving factors come not necessarily from the bottom or the top, but rather from mid-level officials who can promote a discussion on the consequences of space weaponization. </span>It is important to reach out to the non-space community, to help a wider constituency relate to the issues and take greater interest. Getting away from focusing on big, one-off, prestige programs is one way to elicit such an interest.Tech<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nological </span>innovation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while important, </span>does not necessarily lead to an advantage for the country of origin. Rapid dissemination of tech<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nologies among a certain community </span>can affect the security of the countries of origin. For this reason, if weaponization of space is inevitable,</strong> countries should operate as much as possible in a collaborative, transparent fashion<strong>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This suggests the utility of a global regime controlling the technology. Cooperative </span>leadership<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> among youth </span>could be developed to help ensure future cooperation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>This<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> group </span>underlines the importance of reaching<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> young </span>people<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> today in order </span>to stimulate awareness<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the next generation of leaders </span>of the negative spirals that could develop<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>All parties<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> must be made aware that it is in no one's interest to attack each other's satellites; both sides </span>need<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span>info<span style="font-size: 8pt;">rmation </span>and<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> need </span>freedom to access space. A non-interference pact could be developed<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which might name the kinds of weapons not to be used.</span></strong><br />

There will be numerous accidental nuclear wars<br />
Ross 09**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - Reporter for the Chicago Daily News [Sherwood Ross, “Space Race Increasing Risk of Nuclear War,” Atlantic Free Press, Saturday, 04 April 2009 08:21, pg. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atlanticfreepress.com/news/1/8948-space-race-increasing-risk-of-nuclear-war.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atlanticfreepress.com/news/1/8948-space-race-increasing-risk-of-nuclear-war.html</a></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">]</span><br />
<br />
An unchecked race to militarize space<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is underway that </span>is “increasing the risk of an accidental nuclear war while shortening the time for<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> sanity and </span>diplomacy to<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> come into play to </span>halt crises<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” an authority on space warfare</span> says<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. By 2025, the space capabilities of the leading space powers---the U.S., Russia, India and China---will be roughly equal “due to information sharing in a globalized economy,” says noted space researcher </span>Matt Hoey<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in </span>an<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> exclusive interview. Hoey is </span>international military space technology forecaster <span style="font-size: 8pt;">who provides analysis on issues related to technology proliferation and arms control.</span> He is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span>a former senior research associate at the I<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nstitute for </span>D<span style="font-size: 8pt;">efense and </span>D<span style="font-size: 8pt;">isarmament </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tudies </span>and has contributed to<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> publications such as </span>the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span>Space Review<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Through their military and commercial research facilities, the world’s military powers are pursuing development of a reusable, unmanned, hypersonic, space-strike delivery platform that “would permit rapid precision strikes worldwide in 120 minutes or less,” Hoey said. The strike platform could loiter in near-space or in low earth orbit and assault terrestrial targets at incredible speed “with a nuclear or conventional payload and then return to any base in the world on demand,” he explained. While “there will not be a dedicated ‘space war’ in our lifetimes or our children’s,” Hoey said, “we are likely to witness acts of space warfare being committed…in concert with other theatres of combat” on land, sea, and air and cyber space.” Hoey said </span>his research analysis suggests<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: “Back and forth escalation regarding military space capabilities would fuel each nation’s respective space industries as would commercial space races driven by national pride.” “If </span>these systems<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> are deployed in space we </span>will <span style="font-size: 8pt;">be </span>tip<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ping </span>the nuclear balance<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> between nations </span>that has ensured the peace for decades<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” Hoey continued. “The military space race will serve the defense industry much like the cold war and this is already being witnessed in relation to missile defense systems.” Hoey pointed out </span>the arms control community “is still trying to put the nuclear genie<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from decades ago </span>back in the bottle<span style="font-size: 8pt;">” and adds “</span>once this new genie<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(space war) </span>is out it is not going back<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in anytime soon, </span>either<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” The five treaties governing space “are highly outdated,” Hoey said, notably the milestone “Outer Space Treaty” of 1967. Theoretically, the U.S. is also bound by The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 that declares our “activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.” (Rep. Dennis Kucinich(D-Ohio), in introducing a bill to ban the weaponization of space, charged the Bush administration with breaking with that policy by “putting weapons in outer space to give the U.S. the power to control the world.” Kucinich charged “the Air Force is seeking permission to put both offensive and defensive weapons in space.”) Hoey said the research community is expecting space warfare systems to come from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA) and the Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL). But instead of doing straight military R&amp;D in-house, the Pentagon is funding civilian research that has dual-purpose use capabilities---civilian applications as well as military. </span>Because military space race tech<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nologies </span>are the same as those needed to explore the heavens<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, service the international space station and defend against threats from near earth objects, the civilian-military partnerships “present the most challenging dilemma for the arms control community,” Hoey said. That’s because arms control proponents cannot object to their military applications without also opposing “technologies that benefit mankind.” And he warned this will continue to be the case as long as existing treaties fail to differentiate between commercial and military space technology. Because their overlap is “overwhelming,” Hoey noted, in that “systems that destroy can also create and facilitate discoveries,” </span>it behooves the international arms control community to act before our military and commercial industries become “inextricably integrated with military space systems and unable to extract themselves<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” Hoey said the defense community is actively scouting students still enrolled in high school who have demonstrated a talent in aerospace, cryptology and computer security for military research, “in an attempt to compete with emerging science and technology rivals such as China and India.” This would place future generations who dream of discoveries on a fast track towards the defense industry, Hoey said, even if they land jobs in the private sector. </span>As dual-usage progresses<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>far more space tech<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nology </span>roads will lead to<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> careers that contribute to </span>the development space warfare-enabling tech<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nologies. </span>Companies engaged in nano<span style="font-size: 8pt;">technology, </span>robotics and A<span style="font-size: 8pt;">rtificial </span>I<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ntelligence </span>are<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span>being wooed by the military with fat checks<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Hoey said. “These (space exploration and space warfare) systems are being developed through multi-tiered collaborations that include NASA, the Defense Department, universities, big defense contractors and small space start- ups. “</span>The work force consists of military scientists and<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> engineers, students, scientists, </span>and even foreign nationals” ultimately enabling tech<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nology</span> prolif<span style="font-size: 8pt;">eration </span>globally. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">For an arms control community that is focusing primarily on banning specific space weapons currently in development, nearing deployment, and in some cases already deployed, </span>efforts should<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also be focused towards lobbying the international community to begin establishing rules of the road that </span>differentiate between peaceful commercial space tech<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nologies </span>and destructive military<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> space </span>applications before the lines between the two are irreversibly blurred<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Hoey urged. </span>By doing so<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, “</span>next generation space warfare systems<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and space security threats </span>can,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as a result, </span>be prevented<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> long </span>before they<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have a chance to further undermine peace in outer space and </span>increase the probability of nuclear war<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” he said.</span><br />

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has a lot on his mind these days, from cutting the defense budget to managing the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/panetta-afghanistan-withdrawl-begins-and-ends-with-politics/2012/02/01/gIQAmoaliQ_blog.html" rel="nofollow">drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan</a>. But his biggest worry is the growing possibility that <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/israeli-officials-say-the-window-of-opportunity-to-strike-iran-narrowing-fast/2012/01/30/gIQABJf2cQ_story.html" rel="nofollow">Israel will attack Iran</a> over the next few months. Panetta believes there is a strong likelihood that Israel will strike Iran in April, May or June — before Iran enters what Israelis described as a “zone of immunity” to commence building a nuclear bomb. Very soon, the Israelis fear, the Iranians will have stored enough enriched uranium in deep underground facilities to make a weapon — and only the United States could then stop them militarily. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu doesn’t want to leave the fate of Israel dependent on American action, which would be triggered by intelligence that Iran is building a bomb, which it hasn’t done yet. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak may have signaled the prospect of an Israeli attack soon when he asked last month to postpone a planned U.S.-Israel military exercise that would culminate in a live-fire phase in May. Barak apologized that Israel couldn’t devote the resources to the annual exercise this spring. President Obama and Panetta are said to have cautioned the Israelis that the United States opposes an attack, believing that it would derail an increasingly successful international economic sanctions program and other non-military efforts to stop Iran from crossing the threshold. But the White House hasn’t yet decided precisely how the United States would respond if the Israelis do attack. The Obama administration is conducting intense discussions about what an Israeli attack would mean for the United States: whether Iran would target U.S. ships in the region or try to close the Strait of Hormuz; and what effect the conflict and a likely spike in oil prices would have on the fragile global economy. The administration appears to favor staying out of the conflict unless Iran hits U.S. assets, which would trigger a strong U.S. response. This U.S. policy — signaling that Israel is acting on its own — might open a breach like the one in 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower condemned an Israeli-European attack on the Suez Canal. Complicating matters is the 2012 presidential campaign, which has Republicans candidates clamoring for stronger U.S. support of Israel.<br />

JERUSALEM — Israeli leaders on Thursday delivered one of the bluntest warnings to date of possible airstrikes against Iranian nuclear sites, adding to the anxiety in Western capitals that a surprise attack by Israel could spark a broader military conflict in the Middle East. Defense Minister Ehud Barak, speaking at a security forum attended by some of Israel’s top intelligence and military leaders, declared that time was running out for stopping Iran’s nuclear advance, as the country’s uranium facilities disappear into <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nti.org/facilities/165/" rel="nofollow">newly constructed mountain bunkers</a>. “Whoever says ‘later’ may find that later is too late,” Barak said. He switched from Hebrew to English for the last phrase: “later is too late.” The language reflected a deepening rift between Israeli and U.S. officials over the urgency of stopping Iran’s nuclear program, which Western intelligence officials and nuclear experts say could soon put nuclear weapons within the reach of Iran’s rulers. Although accepting the gravity of the Iranian threat, U.S. officials fear being blindsided by an Israeli strike that could have widespread economic and security implications and might only delay, not end, Iran’s nuclear pursuits. In a series of private meetings with Israeli counterparts in recent weeks, Western officials have counseled patience, saying recent economic sanctions and a new European oil embargo are <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-unable-to-stabilize-its-plunging-currency/2012/02/01/gIQAJ175hQ_story.html" rel="nofollow">pummeling Iran’s economy</a> and could soon force the country’s leaders to abandon the nuclear program. Yet Israelis are increasingly signaling that they may act unilaterally if there is no breakthrough in the coming months, according to current and former administration and intelligence officials. “The Obama administration is concerned that Israel could attack Iranian nuclear facilities this year, having given Washington little or no warning,” said<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://eurasiagroup.net/about-eurasia-group/who-is/cliff-kupchan" rel="nofollow"> Cliff Kupchan</a>, a former State Department official who specialized in Iran policy during the Clinton administration and recently returned from meetings with Israeli officials. He said Israel “has refused to assure Washington that prior notice would be provided.” Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta is one of several administration officials to express concern publicly that Israel is positioning itself for a surprise attack. Last month, the administration dispatched the Joint Chiefs chairman, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jcs.mil/biography.aspx?ID=135" rel="nofollow">Gen. Martin E. Dempsey,</a> to the Israeli capital for high-level discussions about the possibility of a unilateral Israeli strike. “Israel has indicated they’re considering this, and we have indicated our concerns,” Panetta told reporters Thursday after a NATO meeting in Brussels. Panetta declined to comment on published reports that he thinks the Israelis could carry out a strike this spring, possibly as early as April. Although the Obama administration has not ruled out U.S. military action against Iran, White House officials are worried that a unilateral strike could shatter the broad international coalition assembled in the past three years to confront Iran over its nuclear program, which Iranian leaders have consistently said is for peaceful purposes.<br />

The United States may need to examine the standards it applies to the fielding of other BMD systems and adjust expectations for an initial SBMD capability. Henry Kissinger has commented on the standard of perfection applied to missile defense: The experts had all the technical arguments on their side, but Reagan had got hold of an elemental political truth: in a world of nuclear weapons, leaders who make no effort to protect their peoples against accident, mad opponents, nuclear proliferation, and a whole host of other foreseeable dangers, invite the opprobrium of posterity if disaster ever does occur. <span style="text-decoration: none;">That it was not possible at the beginning of a complicated research program to demonstrate SDI’s maximum effectiveness was inherent in the complexity of the problem; no weapon would ever have been developed if it first had had to submit to so perfectionist a criterion</span>.55 <span style="text-decoration: none;">Fielding even imperfect elements of the architecture may deter an adversary, as occurred in Desert Storm when imperfect TMD helped keep Israel out of the war. </span>The fact that senior leaders and policy makers tend to focus on current issues because they are more tangible puts the United States at risk of not funding research critical to its future defense. America may need to avoid pressures to sacrifice long-term research for the sake of short-term procurement by moving away from having policy determine the technologies pursued and letting feasible technologies inform policies necessary to deter threats.<br />

<strong>3. Israel Strike causes mid-east war, terrorism, and a global economic meltdown</strong><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">A unilateral Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities would likely have dire consequences, including a regional war, global economic collapse and a major power clash. For an Israeli campaign to succeed, it must be quick and decisive. This requires an attack that would be so overwhelming that Iran would not dare to respond in full force. Such an outcome is extremely unlikely since the locations of some of Iran’s nuclear facilities are not fully known and known facilities are buried deep underground. All of these widely spread facilities are shielded by elaborate air defense systems constructed not only by the Iranians, but also the Chinese and, likely, the Russians as well</span>. By now, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Iran has also built redundant command and control systems and nuclear facilities, developed early-warning systems, acquired ballistic and cruise missiles and upgraded and enlarged its armed forces. Because Iran is well-prepared, a single, conventional Israeli strike — or even numerous strikes — could not destroy all of its capabilities, giving Iran time to respond. </span>A regional war <span style="text-decoration: none;">Unlike Iraq, whose nuclear program Israel destroyed in 1981, Iran has a second-strike capability comprised of a coalition of Iranian, Syrian, Lebanese, Hezbollah, Hamas, and, perhaps, Turkish forces. Internal pressure might compel Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority to join the assault, turning a bad situation into a regional war. </span>During the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, at the apex of its power, Israel was saved from defeat by President Nixon’s shipment of weapons and planes. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Today, Israel’s numerical inferiority is greater, and it faces more determined and better-equipped opponents</span>. Despite Israel’s touted defense systems, Iranian coalition missiles, armed forces, and terrorist attacks would likely wreak havoc on its enemy, leading to a prolonged tit-for-tat. <span style="text-decoration: none;">In the absence of massive U.S. assistance, Israel’s military resources may quickly dwindle, forcing it to use its alleged nuclear weapons,</span> as it had reportedly almost done in 1973. An Israeli nuclear attack would likely destroy most of Iran’s capabilities, but <span style="text-decoration: none;">a crippled Iran and its coalition could still attack neighboring oil facilities, unleash global terrorism, plant mines in the Persian Gulf and impair maritime trade in the Mediterranean, Red Sea and Indian Ocean. Middle Eastern oil shipments would likely slow to a trickle as production declines due to the war and insurance companies decide to drop their risky Middle Eastern clients. Iran and Venezuela would likely stop selling oil to the United States and Europe. The world economy would head into a tailspin; international acrimony would rise; and Iraqi and Afghani citizens might fully turn on the United States, immediately requiring the deployment of more American troops. Russia, China, Venezuela, and maybe Brazil and Turkey — all of which essentially support Iran — could be tempted to form an alliance and openly challenge the U.S. hegemony. </span>Replaying Nixon’s nightmare <span style="text-decoration: none;">Russia and China might rearm their injured Iranian protege overnight</span>, just as Nixon rearmed Israel<span style="text-decoration: none;">, and threaten to intervene,</span> just as the U.S.S.R. threatened to join Egypt and Syria in 1973. President <span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama’s response would likely put U.S. forces on nuclear alert,</span> replaying Nixon’s nightmarish scenario. Iran may well feel duty-bound to respond to a unilateral attack by its Israeli archenemy, but it knows that it could not take on the United States head-to-head. In contrast, if the United States leads the attack, Iran’s response would likely be muted. If Iran chooses to absorb an American-led strike, its allies would likely protest and send weapons, but would probably not risk using force. While no one has a crystal ball, leaders should be risk-averse when choosing war as a foreign policy tool. If attacking Iran is deemed necessary, Israel must wait for an American green light. <span style="text-decoration: none;">A unilateral Israeli strike could ultimately spark World War III.</span><br />

<strong>4. Conflict breakout in the Middle East escalates globally and goes nuclear</strong><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">The Middle East conflict is unparalleled in terms of its potential for spreading globally. During the Cold War</span>, amid which the Arab-Israeli conflict evolved, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the two opposing superpowers directly supported the conflicting parties</span>: the Soviet Union supported Arab countries, while the United States supported Israel. On the one hand, the bipolar world order which existed at that time objectively played in favor of the escalation of the Middle East conflict into a global confrontation. On the other hand, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the Soviet Union and the United States</span> were not interested in such developments and they <span style="text-decoration: none;">managed to keep the situation under control. The behavior of both superpowers in the course of all the wars in the Middle East proves that</span>. In 1956, during the Anglo-French-Israeli military invasion of Egypt (which followed Cairo’s decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company) the United States – contrary to the widespread belief in various countries, including Russia – not only refrained from supporting its allies but insistently pressed – along with the Soviet Union – for the cessation of the armed action. Washington feared that the tripartite aggression would undermine the positions of the West in the Arab world and would result in a direct clash with the Soviet Union. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Fears that hostilities in the Middle East might acquire a global dimension could materialize also during the Six-Day War</span> of 1967. On its eve, Moscow and Washington urged each other to cool down their “clients.” When the war began, both superpowers assured each other that they did not intend to get involved in the crisis militarily and that that they would make efforts at the United Nations to negotiate terms for a ceasefire. On July 5, the Chairman of the Soviet Government, Alexei Kosygin, who was authorized by the Politburo to conduct negotiations on behalf of the Soviet leadership, for the first time ever used a hot line for this purpose. After the USS <em>Liberty</em> was attacked by Israeli forces, which later claimed the attack was a case of mistaken identity, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson immediately notified Kosygin that the movement of the U.S. Navy in the Mediterranean Sea was only intended to help the crew of the attacked ship and to investigate the incident. The situation repeated itself during the hostilities of October 1973. Russian publications of those years argued that it was the Soviet Union that prevented U.S. military involvement in those events. In contrast, many U.S. authors claimed that a U.S. reaction thwarted Soviet plans to send troops to the Middle East. Neither statement is true. The atmosphere was really quite tense. Sentiments both in Washington and Moscow were in favor of interference, yet both capitals were far from taking real action. When U.S. troops were put on high alert, Henry Kissinger assured Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that this was done largely for domestic considerations and should not be seen by Moscow as a hostile act. In a private conversation with Dobrynin, President Richard Nixon said the same, adding that he might have overreacted but that this had been done amidst a hostile campaign against him over Watergate. Meanwhile, Kosygin and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko at a Politburo meeting in Moscow strongly rejected a proposal by Defense Minister Marshal Andrei Grechko to “demonstrate” Soviet military presence in Egypt in response to Israel’s refusal to comply with a UN Security Council resolution. Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev took the side of Kosygin and Gromyko, saying that he was against any Soviet involvement in the conflict. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The above suggests an unequivocal conclusion that control by the superpowers in the bipolar world did not allow the Middle East conflict to escalate into a global confrontation. After the</span> end of the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Cold War, some</span> scholars and political observers <span style="text-decoration: none;">concluded that a real threat of the</span> Arab-Israeli <span style="text-decoration: none;">conflict going beyond regional frameworks ceased to exist. However, </span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">in the 21st century this conclusion no longer conforms to </span></em>the<em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;"> reality</span></em><span style="text-decoration: none;">. The</span> U.S. military <span style="text-decoration: none;">operation in Iraq has changed the balance of forces</span> in the Middle East. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The disappearance of the Iraqi counterbalance has brought Iran to the fore as a regional power</span> claiming a direct role in various Middle East processes. I do not belong to those who believe that the Iranian leadership has already made a political decision to create nuclear weapons of its own. Yet Tehran seems to have set itself the goal of achieving a technological level that would let it make such a decision (the “Japanese model”) under unfavorable circumstances. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Israel already possesses nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles</span>. In such circumstances, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the absence of a Middle East settlement opens a </span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">dangerous prospect</span></em><span style="text-decoration: none;"> of </span>a<em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">nuclear collision</span></em>in the region,<span style="text-decoration: none;"> which would have </span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">catastrophic consequences</span></em><span style="text-decoration: none;"> for the </span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">whole world</span></em><span style="text-decoration: none;">. </span>The transition to a multipolar world has objectively strengthened the role of states and organizations that are directly involved in regional conflicts, which increases the latter’s danger and reduces the possibility of controlling them. This refers, above all, to the Middle East conflict. The coming of Barack Obama to the presidency has allayed fears that the United States could deliver a preventive strike against Iran (under George W. Bush, it was one of the most discussed topics in the United States). However, fears have increased that such a strike can be launched <em>Yevgeny Primakov</em> 1 3 2 RUSSIA IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS VOL. 7 • No. 3 • JULY – SEPTEMBER• 2009 by Israel, which would have unpredictable consequences for the region and beyond. It seems that President Obama’s position does not completely rule out such a possibility.<br />

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">5. Strikes fail—only a risk they destabilize the region and the global economy</span><br />

<br />
1. <span style="text-decoration: none;">There's no good end state. Striking Iranian nuclear sites is like mowing the grass. Unless a strike succeeded in permanently crippling the Iranian capacity to produce and weaponize fissile material, the grass would only grow back again</span>. And <span style="text-decoration: none;">no strike -- or even series of strikes -- can accomplish this. Iran's hardened sites, redundancy of facilities, and secret locations present significant obstacles to a successful attack. Even in the best-case scenario</span> -- an incomplete strike that, say, set back the Iranian nuclear program by two to three years -- <span style="text-decoration: none;">the Iranians would reseed it with the kind of legitimacy and urgency that can only come from having been attacked by an outside power. Self-defense would then become the organizing principle of Iran's nuclear program; it would resonate tremendously throughout the Middle East and even in the international community. </span>The counterargument of course is that the Israelis would cut the grass periodically, striking Iran every 18 months or so. But this situation is probably untenable; it would put Iran and Israel in a permanent state of confrontation and keep the region burning for years to come. 2. <span style="text-decoration: none;">No one can prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Except Iran. </span>The fact is that <span style="text-decoration: none;">India, Pakistan, North Korea, and even Israel -- nations with both a profound sense of insecurity and entitlement -- have all developed nuclear weapons secretly. Iraq and Syria were on their way, too</span>. Iran, under the Shah, was also committed to a nuclear program and might, over time, have tried to weaponize. But <span style="text-decoration: none;">denying Iran a weapon </span>means more than taking away the toys; it <span style="text-decoration: none;">means changing the national calculation and motivation of a power that historically has imagined itself as a great nation. Even in the unlikely event Iran became a democracy, its own regional image and ambitions might still impel it to develop a nuclear capacity. </span>At a minimum, <span style="text-decoration: none;">denying Iran nuclear weapons means fundamentally changing the mullahcracy in Tehran; a military strike by the Israelis might do just the opposite -- further legitimizing it, particularly if there were civilian casualties. There's no better way to mobilize a divided polity or bring out its nationalist and unified character than to demonize a foreign enemy. And the Israelis would be the target of a massive Iranian propaganda effort across the Arab world, an effort that would likely win a great deal of sympathy. </span>3. <span style="text-decoration: none;">There are severe costs to the United States.</span> When countries undertake actions that carry great uncertainty and risk, two questions need to be asked. First, can it be done? Second, what will it cost? The fact that Israel faces an existential threat may understandably lead it to downplay the costs to others, particularly to the United States. After all, it's easy enough for Americans to assume, living thousands of miles away, that Iran is a rational actor and would never use a nuclear weapon against Israel because of the expectation of its own obliteration at the hands of the Israelis or the United States. Israelis, of course, maintain that the threat of retaliation is not an acceptable deterrent and will look to their own interests first. But let's look at what an Israeli strike might do to U.S. interests and an economy still in recession. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Even if the Iranians could only temporarily block shipping in the Strait of Hormuz </span>(through which 40 percent of all oil sails), <span style="text-decoration: none;">the price of oil would spike exponentially, further undermining and sabotaging world markets -- and doing tremendous damage to the fragile economic recovery in the United States. These economic and financial uncertainties could be truly global and catastrophic</span>. At the same time, the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Iranians would</span> certainly try to <span style="text-decoration: none;">turn up the heat against U.S. forces in Afghanistan and those remaining in Iraq, further compounding an already tenuous security situation in both countries. Together with a resurgent al Qaeda in Iraq</span> (a Sunni threat), <span style="text-decoration: none;">U.S. forces would be faced with a Shiite one as well. At the precise moment U.S. forces are committed to leaving Iraq, they could get sucked back into staying. Iran might well lash out at foes and perceived foes across the region</span>, including in the Persian Gulf, <span style="text-decoration: none;">particularly in a place like Bahrain</span>. The Iranian capacity to strike the continental United State may be limited, but <span style="text-decoration: none;">the capacity to wage a clandestine war against U.S. and Israeli interests across the Middle East is far more formidable. </span>4. <span style="text-decoration: none;">It will legitimize and popularize Iran in the Middle East</span>. George H.W. Bush's administration went to great lengths to prevent Israel from responding to Iraqi Scud attacks during the 1991 Gulf War. The logic was pretty compelling: Iraq was in defiance of the international community and U.N. Security Council resolutions, and a 34-country international coalition had formed to enforce the global good. The last thing needed was for Saddam Hussein to turn his invasion of Kuwait into an Arab-Israeli confrontation. The same applies here, to some extent. Sanctions may never prevent the Iranians from acquiring a weapon, but they do have some impact; and <span style="text-decoration: none;">Iran has become greatly isolated. An Israeli attack could undermine all that good work, particularly in the wake of this year's Arab revolutions</span>. An Israeli <span style="text-decoration: none;">attack</span> might be quietly welcomed by the rulers of some Persian Gulf states, but it <span style="text-decoration: none;">would be viewed on the Arab street as another example of Israeli aggression and U.S. double standards</span>. The Arabs would love to see the Iranians taken down a notch or two; but <span style="text-decoration: none;">Israel's involvement is going to complicate the post-strike environment and almost certainly undermine any U.S. effort to clean up the mess that will be left behind. </span>5. If the Israelis strike, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the United States is necessarily involved. There's no way that an Israeli strike comes off without major complications and a military response against U.S. interests</span>. Clearly<span style="text-decoration: none;">, the assumption in Tehran will be that the Israeli attack was coordinated with the United States</span>. Likely <span style="text-decoration: none;">responses include attempts to close off shipping in the Strait of Hormuz and proxy attacks against U.S. military installations and embassies. Even if the United States is actively not involved in the strike, it will </span>likely<span style="text-decoration: none;"> be called upon to aid or support Israel against attacks from Hezbollah and Hamas using high-trajectory weapons. Washington's credibility, at an all-time low internationally, will be further undermined. The United States is now involved in the two longest wars in its history and still has thousands of forces on the ground in two Muslim countries</span>. And let's be clear: <span style="text-decoration: none;">The United States is not winning those wars. The last thing it needs is another war against a Muslim country whose staying power and effectiveness in striking back at America</span> (albeit in asymmetrical ways) <span style="text-decoration: none;">should never be underestimated.</span><br />

<strong>6. Causes global wars</strong><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict</span>. Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent stales. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level. Pollins (20081 advances Modclski and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that <span style="text-decoration: none;">rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next</span>. As such, <span style="text-decoration: none;">exogenous shocks such as economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power</span> (see also Gilpin. 19SJ) <span style="text-decoration: none;">that leads to uncertainty about power balances, increasing the risk of miscalculation</span> (Fcaron. 1995). Alternatively, <span style="text-decoration: none;">even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power</span> (Werner. 1999). Separately. Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level. Copeland's (1996. 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that 'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states. He argues that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, <span style="text-decoration: none;">if the expectations of future trade decline, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources</span>. Crises could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, <span style="text-decoration: none;">others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level</span>. Mom berg and <span style="text-decoration: none;">Hess</span> (2002) <span style="text-decoration: none;">find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">particularly during periods of economic downturn</span>. They write. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The linkage, between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Economic conflict lends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour</span>. Moreover, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other</span> (Hlomhen? &amp; Hess. 2(102. p. X9&gt; <span style="text-decoration: none;">Economic decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism</span> (Blombcrg. Hess. &amp; Wee ra pan a, 2004<span style="text-decoration: none;">). which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions</span>. Furthermore, <span style="text-decoration: none;">crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. &quot;Diversionary theory&quot; suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect</span>. Wang (1996), DcRoucn (1995), and Blombcrg. Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force arc at least indirecti) correlated. Gelpi (1997). Miller (1999). and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that Ihe tendency towards diversionary tactics arc greater for democratic states than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked lo an increase in the use of force. In summary, rcccni <span style="text-decoration: none;">economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict</span> al systemic, dyadic and national levels.' This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.<br />

<strong>7. Strikes cause Pakistan regime collapse</strong><br />

Southeast Asian intelligence sources report that Burma's (Myanmar's) recent abrupt decision to move its capital from Rangoon (Yangon) to remote Pyinmana, 200 miles to the north, is a result of Chinese intelligence warnings to its Burmese allies about the effects of radiation resulting from a U.S. conventional or tactical nuclear attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. <span style="text-decoration: none;">There is concern that a series of attacks on Iranian nuclear installations will create a Chernobyl-like radioactive cloud that would be caught up in monsoon weather in the Indian Ocean. </span>Rangoon (Yangon) capital moved 200 miles north over fears of monsoon season Iran nuclear fallout? <span style="text-decoration: none;">Low-lying Rangoon lies in the path of monsoon rains that would continue to carry radioactive fallout from Iran over South and Southeast Asia</span> between May and October. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Coastal Indian Ocean cities</span> like Rangoon, Dhaka, Calcutta, Mumbai, Chennai, and Colombo <span style="text-decoration: none;">would be affected by the radioactive fallout more than higher elevation cities since humidity intensifies the effects of the fallout</span>. Thousands of government workers were given only two days' notice to pack up and leave Rangoon for the higher (and dryer) mountainous Pyinmana. In neighboring West Bengal, the leftist government and its national leftist allies around the country are planning massive demonstrations during Bush's upcoming trip to India. They are protesting the war in Iraq as well as the threats against Iran. Reports from Yemen indicate that <span style="text-decoration: none;">western oil companies are concerned about U.S. intentions in Iran since the southern Arabian country catches the edge of the monsoon rains that could contain radioactive fallout from an attack, endangering their workers in the country. </span>The Bush administration aborted last minute plans to attack Iranian nuclear and political installations prior to the 2004 presidential election. On October 9, Rumsfeld met with defense minister colleagues on the now decommissioned USS John F. Kennedy in the Persian Gulf to seek support for the attack. That meeting has been confirmed by the Danish Defense Minister who was in attendance, however, the topic of the meeting was not discussed. According to U.S. naval personnel on board the Kennedy, a special &quot;war room&quot; was set up to coordinate the attack. Britain, Australia, Italy, Netherlands, and Japan did not attend the meeting because of their opposition to the attack plans. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Intelligence and military officials around the world are also bracing for the results of a U.S. attack on Iran. This includes the distinct possibility of a major Shia retaliatory attack in Iraq, the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and Afghanistan against U.S. military, diplomatic, and economic targets in the region. Radioactive fallout from a conventional or tactical nuclear attack on Iran will result in major problems with Pakistan, India, China, Russia, Japan, and other downwind countries in Asia and the Pacific Rim, possibly including the fall of the Pervez Musharraf government in Pakistan and replacement by a radical Islamist regime having possession of nuclear weapons. That would provoke a military response from nuclear power India. </span>In a counter-attack, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Iran would immediately launch its Shahab I and II missiles</span> at the U.S. Green Zone in Baghdad, the Al Udeid airbase in Qatar, the US Navy base in Bahrain, Camp Doha base in Kuwait, Al Seeb airbase in Oman, Baghdad International Airport, the U.S. base in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Iran would also launch its long-range Shahab III missiles on the Israeli cities of Tel Aviv, Haifa, Beersheba, Eilat, and the Israeli nuclear complex at Dimona. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Iranian missiles would also be launched at US naval ships in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The virtual end of NATO as a viable defense organization may also result from an attack that will drive a final wedge between Washington and Europe. And China may elect to respond financially and militarily against the United States since Iran is China's second largest source of imported Middle East oil after Saudi Arabia and plans to use an Iranian terminal for the export of natural gas from Turkmenistan</span>. [China now imports 60 percent of its oil needs, and Iran represents 17 percent of those imports].<br />

<strong>a. Regime collapse causes global nuclear war</strong><br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Rosenbaum 7 </span>Ron, “Talkin’ World War III,” The Spectator, 29 November 2007, accessed 2/23/09 <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1199:http://www.slate.com/id/2178792 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2178792" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2178792</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1199 --><br />
I don't want to be alarmist (actually I do, or rather I'd like you to share my sense of alarm), but I'm surprised there isn't a greater sense of concern about those Pakistani nukes. Forget Iran and Israel (Bush's hypothetical route to World War III). <span style="text-decoration: none;">Pakistani nukes now represent the quickest shortcut to a regional nuclear war that could escalate to a global nuclear war. </span>The instability of the Musharraf regime and uncertainty about its control of its &quot;Islamic bomb&quot;—actually an arsenal of nukes, including, reportedly, the long-range missiles they can be mounted on—has been a particular concern since 9/11. The key &quot;unknown unknown&quot; in the decision to invade Afghanistan was whether the considerable bloc of radical Islamist Taliban (if not al-Qaida) sympathizers within the Pakistani military and its notorious intelligence service, the ISI (which in fact helped create al-Qaida), would destabilize the Musharraf government. We dodged a bullet then. But <span style="text-decoration: none;">now the </span>once-shaky<span style="text-decoration: none;"> Musharraf regime is on the brink of collapse.</span> Musharraf has survived assassination attempts before, and there is little likelihood that the forces behind those attempts have a diminished appetite for his demise, literal or political. And consider this: In recent years entire regions of Pakistan have become safe havens for al-Qaida and (quite likely) Osama. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Is it not possible that instead of pursuing elaborate schemes to buy nukes on the black market or smuggle an improvised radioactive &quot;dirty bomb&quot; into the United States, al-Qaida has been biding its time, burrowing its way into Pakistan, waiting for the Islamic bomb to drop into Bin Laden's lap</span>? (I know: not a great choice of metaphor.) Because he thinks long term, he doesn't have to try to scrounge up some &quot;loose nuke&quot; from the former Soviet &quot;stans&quot;; he can just wait. He's one coup—or one bullet—away from being handed the keys to an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons. Those keys: Throughout the years since 9/11, when Pakistan was supposedly our valiant ally against terrorism, various leaks and hints have offered false reassurances that the United States had in some way &quot;secured&quot; the Pakistani nuclear arsenal. That we were virtually in the control rooms with a hand on the switch. But then, in the wake of the new threats to Musharraf's precarious regime, came the New York Times <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/washington/18nuke.html?hp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">front-pager</a> on Nov. 18 (one month after Bush's &quot;World War III&quot; pronouncement in the White House) on the nature of U.S. &quot;control&quot; over Pakistani nukes. The Times had held this story for more than three years at the behest of the Bush administration. This time, when discussion of the issue in Pakistan became more public in the midst of the crisis and the Times told the administration it wanted to publish, the White House withdrew its request for a hold. If people in the administration withdrew their request because they thought the story would be in any way reassuring, they are, to put it mildly, out of their minds. The rumors circulating that the United States was somehow in Pakistani launch control rooms, presumably exercising some control, turn out to be—the Times story revealed—wishful thinking. In fact, the American efforts appear to have been aimed at preventing an &quot;unauthorized&quot; launch, a scenario in which al-Qaida or some terrorist group steals a weapon and tries to use it. But the real danger is not &quot;unauthorized&quot; launches but unwelcome &quot;authorized&quot; ones. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The real worry is what happens when Musharraf falls,</span> which seems at least a good possibility. <span style="text-decoration: none;">What happens if the authority to authorize a launch falls into the hands of either al-Qaida-sympathizer elements in the military and intelligence service or, worst case, al-Qaida itself?</span> After all, polls in Pakistan have consistently shown Bin Laden to be more popular than Musharraf. From a cave to a nuclear control room is not an utterly unforeseeable nightmare.<br />

There was. For some 16 months, NASA had been explor­ing with SDIO possibilities of using DoD technologies in its space exploration program. So that early in 1992, SDIO for­mulated the concept for a space probe mission based on Brilliant Pebbles technologies. In addition to NASA, the Na­val Research Laboratory provided the spacecraft and overall system integration, and Lawrence Livermore National Lab­oratory provided the sensors, propulsion, computers, and the like, using hardware gathered up from Brilliant Pebbles demonstration programs that it was handling. The mission: return to the moon, map its surface, fly by the Earth and slingshot past a near-Earth asteroid (Geogra­phos) on a planned near-miss and continue out into deep space. Hence the space probe’s name, <em>Clementine</em> (“lost and gone forever,” per the old ballad). Authorized in the waning days of the Bush-41 administration, preparations were al­lowed to continue under the new Clinton administration, so that the Clementine mission was launched aboard a Titan II rocket on January 25, 1994, and was completed in August. What, then, was the mission performance outcome? While it was unable to complete the asteroid flyby, Clem­entine was “spectacularly successful” in the lunar portion of its mission, completing about 350 lunar orbits in two months and taking almost 1.8 million multi-spectral imag­es of the moon (using 15 spectral bands). Clementine was the first high-fidelity photometric survey of an extraterres­trial body and its data indicated the existence of water at the lunar poles. It delivered more data and more informa­tion than the entire Apolloprogram, with a total mission program cost of $80 million. The small mission team won awards from NASA and the National Academy of Sciences, and results of the surveys and mission were widely (and fa­vorably) reported. A replica of <em>Clementine</em> now hangs in a place of honor in the Smithsonian. In terms of the missionperformance of Brilliant Pebbles technologies, everything worked. As Baucom records: Clementine served as a highly successful test bed for twenty-three lightweight SDI technologies, all of which performed properly<em>. A number of</em> these technologies were directly related to the Brilliant Pebbles program<em>. Specifically,</em> Clementine’s cam­eras and sensors had been developed for BP. Cle­mentine also verified the autonomous operational mode that was to have been employed with Bril­liant Pebbles.<em>.. [and] lent support to the</em> philoso­phy that<em>had initially</em> guided the Brilliant Pebbles <em>development and acquisition process –</em> the maxi­mum use of commercial off-the-shelf components and a minimum reliance on hardware designed to military specifications. Thus, the by-product of the Clementine mission was to space-qualify all of the first generation of Brilliant Pebblestech­nologies, except for the miniature propulsion elements for the space interceptor, which were subsequently tested with “very efficient” results in theAstridlaunch experiment in February 1994, thus completing the qualification requirements.19 <em>Clementine</em> notwithstanding, the stop-work order issued approximately five months earlier on Brilliant Pebbles and other space-related projects continued the dismantling pro­cess without interruption. Little, if any, of the SBI technol­ogies survived – not even for use in the land-based system which SDIO had been working on per instructions from Congress. It was to have been an agile, fast, and lightweight land-based interceptor to harmonize with other GPALS components for a layered defense and thus drew heavily on these technologies (most of which <em>Clementine</em> had proved); known as the GBI-X KV, it was to weigh about 20 kilograms (44 pounds) but was abruptly cancelled.20<br />

<strong>And, removes psychological motive</strong><br />

Ba’athist Iraq’s war-weary population was likewise subject to massive and—let’s face it—masterful propaganda. Hitting the hated Israelis, even with ineffective weapons, and the fact that due to US political pressure the Israelis did not strike back, was seen by Iraqis and by other Arabs as a great victory. A claim made explicit in a memoir written by Saddam’s missile force commander Hazim Abd al-Razzaq al-Ayyubi <em>Forty-Three Missiles on the Zionist Enemy</em> published in Amman, Jordan in 1998. Al-Ayyubi described how, in the years and months leading up to the war, his two missile brigades practiced their “shoot and scoot” operational techniques. He also wrote about the very serious efforts the Iraqis made building multiple secure communications links using both radio and phone lines. According to a report to Saddam, they started the war with 230 missiles and 75 “special” warheads. Interestingly, he also bragged about the success of his deception units, not only in fooling US and Coalition targeting efforts, but also in deceiving the UN inspectors who tried to account for the missiles. Wood makes it clear “that despite the cost to the Iraqi people, Iraq’s successful violation of UNSC [United Nations Security Council] resolution 687 was a source of great pride to its leaders.” Most, but not all, of what the Iraqis believed they had accomplished with their attacks was nonsense. The claims that they hit Ben Gurion Airport and the Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv, or the Haifa Technology Institute, are just not serious. As was their claim to have been “the first Arab country to conduct effective offensive operations against the enemy (Israel).” What is true is that these attacks “fulfilled the Iraqi President’s vow that he would retaliate against Israel as revenge for their attacks against the Iraqi reactor.” It is exactly this need for revenge that should get the attention of those in the US government who are trying to design a realistic missile defense policy for the next fifty years. Tyrannical regimes and terrorist movements share the need to excite people with dramatic and violent events. The more spectacular the attack, the better. Firing long-range missiles at an enemy, even if you only hit an empty parking lot, can provide followers with a level of emotional satisfaction. This in turn can motivate them to continue to fight even in a seemingly hopeless battle. In future wars, those who are fighting against the West—today Iran or North Korea, tomorrow, who knows?—will use ballistic missiles not only to terrorize enemy civilian populations but to build morale among their own forces and people. Missile defense is the key to winning this critical psychological battle. As long as their missiles are being shot out of the sky, claims that they are hurting the enemy and thus filling people’s need for revenge can be shown to be utterly empty. This, however, cannot be done with terminal phase defense weapons. To hit a missile or a warhead that is descending towards its target may be a feat of technological skill, but it does nothing to decrease the emotional satisfaction that comes from striking a hated enemy. Midcourse interceptors such as the US GBI or the Israeli Arrow are better, but the best way to publicly humiliate those who are launching Scud-type missiles is to shoot them down as soon after they leave the launch pad as possible. The only weapon now in development that will—in theory—be able to do this is the Airborne Laser (ABL), which the Missile Defense Agency plans to test next year. This is indeed a promising system, but it has its limits. Its range is, according to unclassified reports, about 300 kilometers, and the US only plans to build, at most, seven aircraft. If the goal is to prevent the enemy from using its missile attacks to build its own side’s morale and thus lengthen the war, another solution must be found. Space-based interceptors, such as a new version of the Brilliant Pebbles program that was canceled in 1993, could, in combination with space- and ground-based sensors, knock down missiles of this type in the boost phase. Significantly, they would do so over the launching country’s own territory and at least some of the citizens would witness the destruction of their leader’s vengeance weapons. This news would spread through word of mouth. This might be one of the keys to undermining their will to make war and help shorten the conflict.<br />

<strong>The best deterrent is the reduction of the likelihood of nuclear war</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">One approach to confronting these risks is deterrence. By fielding nuclear retaliatory capabilities of their own, the U.S. and its allies could send the message that any attack would unleash retaliatory strikes against civilian and economic targets, often referred to as “soft targets.” This is not a credible deterrent. There is a fundamental asymmetry of values between non-aggressive countries such as the U.S. and its allies and potentially aggressive actors such as China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and terrorist organizations. The U.S. and its allies fundamentally value the well-being of their people, prosperity, and the preservation of liberty. Aggressive states fundamentally value power and the means to preserve it, such as internal repression and external intimidation. With such asymmetry, the most effective deterrent is not the threat of attack. Instead, it is the capability to reduce and eliminate the likelihood of a successful attack on the U.S. and its allies. That requires a strategic force comprised of a balanced mix of offensive and defensive capabilities, including nuclear and conventional strategic weapons</span><br />
