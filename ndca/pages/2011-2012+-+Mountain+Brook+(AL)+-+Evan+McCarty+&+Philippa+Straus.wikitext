Contention 1 is Inherency



Although solar power satellites, also known as SPS, hold much promise, the government has yet to run a full-scale demonstration of a fully functioning satellite for the private sector.

*TRL = Technology Readiness Level



<span class="Underline">A variety of tests and … -scale SPS pilot plant demonstrations</span>. 



Thus We Present the Following Plan



The United States federal government should demonstrate space-based solar power beyond the Earth's mesosphere.



Contention 2 is the Advantages



Advantage 1 is Warming



The science is settled - global warming is real and caused by human greenhouse gas emissions. Left unchecked, it threatens to wipe out the human race

Dr. Ekins, Professor of Energy and Environmental Policy @ University College of London, et al in 2011 (Anthony Costello, Professor and Co-Director of the Institute for Global Health @ University College London, Mark Malsin, Professor in the Department of Geography @ UCL, Director of the UCL Institute for Human Health and Performance, Anne Johnson, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology @ UCL, Paul Ekins, PhD in Economics from University of London and Professor of Energy and Environmental Policy @ UCL Energy Institute, "Global health and climate change: moving from denial and catastrophic fatalism to positive action," May, http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1942/1866.full)



Advocacy about the health consequences … , therefore __making many environments uninhabitable.__



Warming outweighs all other impacts - it will make the planet uninhabitable and cause human extinction

Flournoy, Citing Dr. Hsu, a NASA scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center, in 2012 | PhD and MA from the University of Texas, Former Dean of the University College @ Ohio University, Former Associate Dean @ State University of New York and Case Institute of Technology, Project Manager for University/Industry Experiments for the NASA ACTS Satellite, Currently Professor of Telecommunications @ Scripps College of Communications @ Ohio University (Don, "Solar Power Satellites," January, Springer Briefs in Space Development, Book, EMM)



In the Online Journal of … __of our Sun__” (Hsu 2010 ) (Fig . 2.1 ).



And, SPS solves warming



It produces unlimited clean energy that can be used to replace fossil fuels globally

Mankins, Former NASA scientist with over 25 years of experience, in 2008 | <span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">President of SPA and Former NASA Scientist (John, Preeminent Global Expert on SSP, SPA = Space Power Association, President of ARTEMIS Innovation Management Solutions, Worked @ NASA for 25 Years, “</span>Space-Based Solar Power: Inexhaustible Energy From Orbit,” Spring, Ad Astra, http://www.nss.org/adastra/AdAstra-SBSP-2008.pdf, EMM)



At an altitude of 22,240 miles … __separated by thousands of miles.__ 



And, SPS is cost-competitive with fossil fuels - it would completely replace them in a short timeframe

Dr. Flournoy, Professor of Telecommunications @ Ohio University, in 2012 | PhD and MA from the University of Texas, Former Dean of the University College @ Ohio University, Former Associate Dean @ State University of New York and Case Institute of Technology, Project Manager for University/Industry Experiments for the NASA ACTS Satellite, Currently Professor of Telecommunications @ Scripps College of Communications @ Ohio University (Don, "Solar Power Satellites," January, Springer Briefs in Space Development, Book, EMM)



One of the obvious opportunities … night-and-day fuel source.



And, only SPS can solve for warming - other alternative energies are too intermittent and cannot be deployed on a wide enough scale

Dr. Flournoy, Professor of Telecommunications @ Ohio University, in 2012 | PhD and MA from the University of Texas, Former Dean of the University College @ Ohio University, Former Associate Dean @ State University of New York and Case Institute of Technology, Project Manager for University/Industry Experiments for the NASA ACTS Satellite, Currently Professor of Telecommunications @ Scripps College of Communications @ Ohio University (Don, "Solar Power Satellites," January, Springer Briefs in Space Development, Book, EMM)



__Alternative terrestrial energy is not …__ for terrorists (National Space Society 2008 ).





Advantage 2 is the Air Force



The Air Force is facing an energy crisis - fossil fuels are running out and becoming too expensive - this will threaten its future power projection capabilities

Donley, Secretary of the Air Force, and Schwartz, Air Force General, in 2012 (Michael and Norton, "Energy Horizons: United States Air Force Energy S&T Vision 2011-2026," Jan 31, EMM)



__The Air Force faces daunting …__ now and __in the future.__



And, SPS solves - it can replace oil for Air Force usage and doesn't have the same vulnerability

Arkin, citing Mark Maybury, Chief Scientist for the US Air Force, in 2012 – Editor, NBC Universal (Daniel, 2/22/12, “Air Force Plans Nuke-Powered Spacecraft, Space-Based Power Stations”, http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/tech/NATL-Report-US-Air-Force-Plans-Energy-Revolution-139967283.html)



The [USAF] United States Air … __completely revolutionary__, the report says.



And, US Air Force capabilities are critical to preserve US international military power - it's the deciding factor in every major conflict

Dunlap, Major General of the US Air Force, in 2006 | Major General of the USAF, Deputy Judge Advocate of the Air Force (Maj. General, deputy judge advocate of the Air Force, National War College graduate with over 30 years of Armed Forces Experience, Charles Jr., Armed Forces Journal, “America’s Asymmetric Advantage”, http://www.armedforcesjournal.com/2006/09/2009013)



So where does that leave us? … __of the U.S. is at risk.__ 



And, US military power is vital to global stability - weakening will cause rising challengers to start nuclear wars

Barnett, Former Senior Strategic Researcher and Professor at the Naval War College, in 2011 (Thomas, Former Senior Strategic Researcher and Professor in the Warfare Analysis & Research Department, Center for Naval Warfare Studies, U.S. Naval War College American military geostrategist and Chief Analyst at Wikistrat., worked as the Assistant for Strategic Futures in the Office of Force Transformation in the Department of Defense, “The New Rules: Leadership Fatigue Puts U.S., and Globalization, at Crossroads,” March 7 [[http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/8099/the-new-rules-leadership-fatigue-puts-u-s-and-globalization-at-crossroads]])



Events in Libya are a further … <span class="underline0">in the geometry to come.</span>



Contention 3 is Solvency



SPS is technologically feasible already - … prove there are __no__ barriers

<span class="Underline">Garretson, Lieutenant Colonel of the US Air Force, in 2012 | Lieutenant Colonel of the USAF serving on CSAF's Strategic Studies Group (Peter, "Solar Power in Space?" Strategic Studies Quarterly Spring, EMM)</span>



<span class="Underline">As of 2010, the fundamental research … maturity appear to be essential.” </span>



And, a government demonstration would motivate the private sector to adopt SPS

International Academy of Astronautics in 2011 | (International Academy of Astronautics, Academy that brings together the world's foremost experts in the disciplines of astronautics on a regular basis to recognize the accomplishments of their peers, and explores and discuss cutting-edge issues in space research and technology, 4-2011, “The First International Assessment of Space Solar Power: Opportunities, Issues and Potential Pathways Forward,” Green Energy From Space Solar Power, http://iaaweb.org/iaa/Scientific%20Activity/Study%20Groups/SG%20Commission%203/sg311/sg311finalreport.pdf)

===Harvard 1AC Info=== 

We alternated between the inflatable and non-GEO plan texts depending on who we debated. We read the Energy advantage every round along with some combination of Aerospace, Trade, and Weather.

We broke NASA credibility in doubles against Westminster HX.

===Emory 1AC Info=== 

Round 1 v. MBA we read the Energy Advantage and the Aerospace Advantage with Airpower, Economy, and Hegemony.

Every other aff round we read Energy, Trade (with Protectionism and Dollar Heg), and Weather Modification (with China and Russia war).

===MBA 1AC Info=== 

We read the energy advantage, the aerospace advantage (with the airpower and economy scenario [shortened]), and the weather advantage with hegemony, china, and sea turtles. Sea turtles was replaced in octas against Edina SS by more solvency cards.

===Ohio Valley 1AC Info=== 

In prelims we read the Warming Advantage, the Weather Modification Advantage (Version: China + Heg), and the Aerospace Advantage (Version: Economy)

In quarters and finals we read the Economy/Trade Advantage with all three scenarios, the weather modification advantage (Version: Atmosphere + Russia) and the Warming Advantage.
