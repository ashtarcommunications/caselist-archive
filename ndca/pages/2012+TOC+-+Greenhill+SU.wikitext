We have been conditioned, ……that they are totally blind to the profound risk to their own lives.

Scenario 2: Accidents –

The risk of accidental or intentional use is high and growing – makes spread more likely

(“The Complementary Role Of Environmental And Security Biological Control Regimes In The 21st Century - Plenary 1,” pg lexis//ghs-ef)//
//The 21st century promises tremendous …… and animal health systems around the world.//

//And, a SINGLE accident can cause global bioweapons spread overnight – there is no chance at containment//

Other state bioweapons …… will precipitate a global calamity — and the work of a generation ol smallpox fighters to eradicate the ancient plague could be undone.

Independent Extinction - generic defense doesn’t apply

As an indication of the growing complexity ……programs conducted by the United States.

Advantage 2: Green Intelligence

First, MEDEA is a satellite intelligence sharing program for scientists and the CIA – providing consistent satellite info is key to broader S&T cooperation

Intelligence systems by definition collect foreign intelligence …..to minimize harm to commercial suppliers.

The Impact is Forest Health -

First, the risk of deforestation is growing – the impact is depleted oxygen levels, loss of rainforests, and extinction of all life

UNDERSTANDING what is happening …… active chainsaws there.

And, shared Intelligence Satellites provide critical information for the prevention of deforestation and protection of forest health key critical to species protection
