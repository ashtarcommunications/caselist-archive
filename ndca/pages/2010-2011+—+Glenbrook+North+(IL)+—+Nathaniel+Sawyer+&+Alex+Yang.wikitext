=St. Mark's Affirmative - South Korea= 
==1AC Plan== 
**Plan: The United States federal government should implement a phased withdrawal of its military presence in the Republic of Korea.**

==1AC Korean Conflict== 
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Advantage one is Korea Conflict – </span>**

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The sinking of South Korea’s ship makes conflict inevitable – retaliation will spark an escalatory war and failure to respond will only cause more North Korean provocations </span>**
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Bandow, 10</span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former special assistant to Reagan (4/18/10, Doug, “Let the Koreans Take Care of the Koreas,” [[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/doug-bandow/let-the-koreans-take-care_b_542141.html]], JMP)</span>
It has been weeks since the South Korean ship Cheonan sank in the Yellow Sea near the disputed boundary between South and North Korea
............Although the bilateral U.S.-South Korean defense treaty does not make American intervention automatic, it is unimaginable that an American administration would stand aside in a conflict. 

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Moreover, the risk of miscalculation and war on the peninsula is also high </span>**
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sanger, 10</span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> (5/28/10, David E. Sanger, NY Times, “In the Koreas, Five Possible Ways to War,”</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">[[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/weekinreview/30sanger.html]], JMP)</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">USUALLY, there is a familiar cycle to Korea crises.</span>
Like a street gang showing off its power to run amok in a well-heeled neighborhood, the North Koreans launch a missile over Japan or set off a nuclear test or stage an attack............<span style="font-size: 10pt;">it could spread to the Middle East or Southeast Asia, or wherever else North Korea found its customers.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Additionally, U.S. presence makes provocations inevitable and guarantees our draw in</span>**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">**Bandow, 10** – Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute and former Special Assistant to Reagan (5/3/10, Doug, “Taming Pyongyang,” [[http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=23336]], JMP)</span>
Suspicions continue to mount that North Korea torpedoed the Cheonan, a South Korean corvette which sank more than a month ago in the Yellow Sea to the west of the Korean peninsula.............
To argue that America must continue doing so in 2010 is bizarre.

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Regardless of what causes the war, the result is extinction</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hayes </span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">& Hamel-Green**, 10** – *Executive Director of the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainable Development, AND Executive Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Education and Human Development act Victoria University (1/5/10, Executive Dean at Victoria, “The Path Not Taken, the Way Still Open: Denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/10001HayesHamalGreen.pdf]]</span>)</span>
The international community is increasingly aware that cooperative diplomacy is the most productive way to tackle the multiple, interconnected global challenges facing humanity, not least of which is the increasing proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.............
The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community. 

==1AC China== 
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Advantage two is China</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tensions with China are running hot – risks deliberate and miscalculated conflict</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Yuan 10 </span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">– Associate Professor at the Center for International Security Studies in Sydney</span>, Australia (Jingdong, August 20, 2010, Asia Times, Deep Reasons for China and US to bristle, http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/LH20Ad01.html, RBond)
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">China's strong reaction to the United States' call for multilateral negotiation to resolve territorial disputes in the South China Sea fits the rising tide of tensions between Beijing and Washington over a number of issues. </span>
<span class="Underline">Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi stated that interventions last month from US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested the US was ganging with other countries in the region against China.</span>............
<span class="Underline">Much depends on whether cooler heads will prevail in Beijing and Washington even if they have to live with a strategic rivalry for decades to come</span>.

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Korea is key – U.S. presence there and continued Chinese intransigence risks superpower conflict </span>**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">**Emmott, 10** – Independent writer and consultant on international affairs and former editor of The Economist (5/31/10, Bill, The Sunday Times, “China’s stance on North Korea could lead to war,” http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/bill_emmott/article7140609.ece, JMP)</span>
<span class="Underline">It is time to worry rather more, by focusing instead on China and its policy towards North Korea.</span>............
the Korean Peninsula, to force it to join the 21st century rather than staying stuck in the 1950s. Unless that happens, next time it could really be war. 

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The plan is the vital concession for Chinese co-operation on North Korea – also resolves territorial disputes and prevents decline in relations</span>**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">**Carpenter 10**—vice president for defense and foreign-policy studies at the Cato Institute (Ted Galen, 3 August 2010, China Spats, http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/china-spats-3778, RBatra)</span>
<span class="Underline">Relations between China and the United States have become decidedly testy in recent weeks. Sharp disagreements over policy toward North Korea and the status of disputed islands in the South China Sea especially have raised tensions</span>.............
<span class="Underline">Yet Washington has not offered the slightest hint of concessions on either issue. U.S. officials implicitly expect Beijing to accept the risks entailed in getting tough with Pyongyang but receive nothing at all in return</span>.

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is key to overall Chinese relations</span>**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">**Bandow 9** (Spring, Doug, “A New Approach to Counter Nuclear Proliferation on the Korean Peninsula,” International Journal of Korean Studies, p55-83,http://www.icks.org/publication/pdf/2009-SPRING-SUMMER/4.pdf, DA 9/1, MaT)</span>
But <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">American engagement may not be enough. The PRC could play a particularly important role in dissuading the North from its nuclear course.</span></span>.
............
<span class="Underline">Nevertheless, the most important and immediate goal remains halting nuclear proliferation in Northeast Asia</span>.

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Military presence is aimed at containing China—causes a self-fulfilling prophecy that guarantees war in Asia</span>**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">**Klare 6**—professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College, 2006 [Michael, “Containing China: The US's real objective”, http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/HD20Ad01.html]</span>
Accompanying all these diplomatic initiatives has been a vigorous, if largely unheralded, effort by the Department of Defense (DoD) to bolster US military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region.............
<span class="Underline">This will make the amicable long-term settlement of the Taiwan problem and of North Korea's nuclear program that much more difficult, and increase the risk of unintended escalation to full-scale war in Asia. There can be no victors from such a conflagration</span>.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">**Escalation is likely – impact is full-scale US/China nuclear war**</span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">**Dodge, 5** (Paul, Department of Defense and Strategic Studies – Missouri State University, “China’s Naval Strategy and Nuclear Weapons: The Risks of Intentional and Inadvertent Nuclear Escalation”, Comparative Strategy, 24(5), December, p. 415-416)</span>
In the summer of 2005, Chinese Major-General Zhu Chenghu threatened the United States with nuclear attack, stating that, “If the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition on to the target zone on China’s territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons.............
<span class="Underline">It is only through the exploration of the impacts of U.S. offensive and defensive actions, as well as the concomitant attrition of conventional forces, that the full escalatory dangers of Chinese warfighting strategy may be revealed</span>.

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">And U.S.-China relations solve every scenario for extinction—economic decline, global insecurity, warming, prolif, and terrorism are all inevitable without significant bilateral co-operation</span>**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">**Cohen 9** (William S. Cohen is chairman and CEO of The Cohen Group, a strategic business consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. Secretary Cohen served as U.S. secretary of defense, Maurice R. Greenberg is chairman and CEO of C.V. Starr & Co., Inc. Mr. Greenberg retired four years ago as chairman and CEO of American International Group (AIG) after more than 40 years of leadership, creating the largest insurance company in history, “Smart Power in U.S.-China Relations,” pg online @ http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090309_mcgiffert_uschinasmartpower_web.pdf //ef) </span>
<span class="Underline">The evolution of Sino-U.S. relations</span> over the next months, years, and decades <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">has the potential to have a greater impact on global security and prosperity than any other bilateral or multilateral arrangement.</span></span>............
<span class="Underline">But the American and Chinese people should expect their leaders to come together on those vital issues that require their cooperation. U.S.-China partnership, though not inevitable, is indispensable</span>.

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Failure to stem warming results in extinction</span>**

We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told the Guardian last week. At first sight this looks like wise counsel from the climate science adviser to Defra.............
Many scientists warn that this historical event <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">may be analogous to the present</span></span>: the <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">warming caused by human emissions </span></span>could propel us towards <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">a </span></span>similar <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">hothouse Earth</span></span>.

==1AC Regionalism== 
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Advantage three is Regionalism – </span>**

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">US Bilateral policies fail is East Asian – regionalism is vital for the area’s stability </span>**
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Francis, 06</span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – former Australian Ambassador to Croatia and fellow at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University from 05-06 (Fall 2006, Neil, Harvard International Review, “For an East Asian Union: Rethinking Asia's Cold War Alliances,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://hir.harvard.edu/index.php?page=article&id=1586]]</span>, JMP)</span>
At the conclusion of the Second World War, the United States established bilateral military alliances in the Asia-Pacific intended to contain Soviet and Chinese communist expansion in the region.............
The determining factor will be ASEAN’s ability to provide the leadership necessary to create a strong, independent East Asian Union.

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Withdrawing troops is key – presence ensures other countries pass the buck to the US </span>**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Carpenter</span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> and Bandow </span>**4 **- * Vice President of Defense and Foreign Studies at the Cato Institute, AND** Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute (Ted Galen Carpenter, 12/2004, The Korean Conundrum: America’s Troubled Relations With North and South Korea, pg 160-161) 
<span class="Underline">The security treaties with the United States and the U.S. troop presence allow the diversion of financial resources to domestic priorities. And relying on the United States for security avoids painful debates about what kind of policy those countries need to pursue.</span>............
<span class="Underline">America still can have a potent power projection capability with a reduced military presence based in Guam and other U.S. territories in the central and west-central Pacific. </span>

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Accelerating U.S. withdrawal catalyzes a multipolar balance of power in the region </span>**
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Espiritu, 06</span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – Commander, U.S. Navy (3/15/06, Commander Emilson M. Espiritu, “The Eagle Heads Home: Rethinking National Security Policy for The Asia-Pacific Region,” [[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA448817&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf]], JMP)</span>
Can the U.S. live with the risk of an unstable Korean Peninsula? The obvious answer is “no.” It is clear that a stable Korean peninsula is more beneficial to the United States.............
It is possible by taking the “let them work it out” (the Koreas) approach would certainly be advantageous to the U.S. The time is now for the Eagle to head home. 

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Regionalism solves great power war </span>**
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Lee, 09</span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – Seoul National University (December 2009, Geun, “The Nexus between Korea’s Regional Security Options and Domestic Politics,” [[http://www.cfr.org/|www.cfr.org]], JMP)</span>
Korea’s Option of Multilateral Security Cooperation in Northeast Asia The idea of multilateral security cooperation in Northeast Asia is not a recent one. Since 1988, Korea has advocated regional security cooperation, and in 1994, Korea officially proposed the Northeast Asia Security Dialogue (NEASED) at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
............Moreover, if the U.S. capability and credibility in delivering its security promises to alliance partners are questioned, there will be fewer veto powers in Korean politics against a multilateral security mechanism in Northeast Asia, particularly when such an option still maintains a loose form of the U.S.-Korea alliance. 

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">And, it solves territorial disputes and a litany of other impacts </span>**
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nanto, 08</span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – Specialist in Industry and Trade Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division for Congressional Research Services (1/4, “East Asian Regional Architecture: New Economic and Security Arrangements and U.S. Policy,” www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33653.pdf)</span>
A stronger regional security organization in East Asia could play a role in quelling terrorism by violent extremists.............
A metric by which any architecture can be evaluated, however, is how well it contributes to a resolution of problems as they now exist or will exist in the future. 

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Territorial disputes cause great power wars </span>**
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Waldron, 97</span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – professor of strategy and policy at the U.S. Naval War College and an associate of the Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at Harvard (March 1997, Arthur, Commentary, “How Not to Deal with China,” EBSCO</span>
MAKING THESE flash-points all the more volatile has been a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of China's weapons acquisitions.............
Chains of alliance or interest, perhaps not clearly understood until the moment of crisis itself, could easily draw in neighboring states--Russia, or India, or Japan--or the United States.

==1AC Solvency== 
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Our last contention is solvency – </span>**

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">U.S. presence is useless to deter North Korea – withdrawal will motivate South Korea and China to stabilize and de-nuclearize the peninsula</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Erickson, 10</span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – Executive Director of CenterMovement.org (5/6/10, Stephen, “End the Cold War in Korea: Bring American Troops Home Before it’s Too Late,” [[http://www.centermovement.org/topics-issues/end-the-cold-war-in-korea-bring-american-troops-home-before-its-too-late/]], JMP)</span>
On the night of March 26 the South Korean 1,200-ton warship Cheonan patrolled the boundary waters between North and South Korea. At 10:45 an explosion near the bow rocked the vessel and sank the Cheonan, taking the lives of 46 crew members with it..............
The US military presence in Korea is a Cold War artifact that needs to be brought home before it’s too late.
