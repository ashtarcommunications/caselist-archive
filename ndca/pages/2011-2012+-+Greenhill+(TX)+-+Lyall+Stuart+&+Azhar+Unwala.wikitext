**Ackerman 2k10**
(Lt. Col. Edward, USAF, “US Military, Commercial, And InternationalCooperationForImproved Space Situational Awareness” February 17, 2010, Air War College, pg online//greenhill-au)
Commercial and international partnerships can dramatically improve SSA by providing precise information on mission specific activities from launch, to on-orbit operations, to final satellite disposal activities. Key benefits to commercial and international cooperation include quantitative and qualitative improvements in SSA data, freeing SSN sensors for other tasking, and improved collision forecasting. A significant input from commercial and international operators, which can enhance an essential characteristic of SSA, is space object positional information. An element set (ELSET) provides positional data on a satellite. An ELSET contains all the information needed to fix an object‟s position in space at a given time. Satellite operators; whether they are US military, civil, commercial, or foreign will typically possess the most accurate ELSETs on their satellites. This is because satellite operators have access to positional data coming directly from their satellite and ground stations that provides an approximate 25 percent increase in accuracy over the SSN. 36 Therefore, satellite operator derived ELSETs improve SSA tasks such as accurately predicting collisions between space objects. As the SSN relies on being “told” where to look to track space objects, it can only estimate which sensors will detect a new space object based on the object‟s initial launch azimuth. While satellites going into low earth orbit (LEO) will eventually fly through the “detection fan” of a sensor, objects going beyond LEO, to medium earth orbit, (MEO), geosynchronous orbit (GEO), or highly elliptical orbit (HEO), can quickly become “lost” as they move beyond the SSN‟s ability to track. Without knowing the plan for maneuvering from LEO to one of these other orbits, a great deal of time and effort may be required to search and re- identify the satellite as it moves to a final orbit. Of course, tracking a satellite is easier when a satellite operator provides their ELSETs. In addition to collision avoidance, this type of precise SSA aids other important tasks such as radio frequency deconfliction and anomaly detection/resolution on known space objects where operators‟ ELSETs are available. On the other hand, for detecting, tracking, and identifying unknown space objects, additional sources of SSA information are required.

<span style="text-decoration: none;">Space is also cluttered by electronic signals. Roughly 9,000 satellite transponders that send communications between space and the ground are expected to be active by 2015, increasing the probability of radio frequency interference. Military planners are keenly aware that a satellite does not need to be physically damaged to be rendered useless it only has to be jammed, intentionally or otherwise. The dramatic increase in physical and electronic hazards means we are approaching a point at which the limitless frontier no longer seems quite so limitless.</span>

2NC Overview**
The purpose of responsive space is to massively increase the number of space launches and to do so on extremely short notice; to make them as clandestine as possible. This will prevent us from continuing to give advanced notice of pending space launches. All of the short notice launches the plan causes will get mistaken for ICBM launches and cause an accidental nuclear war.
And, The rapid launch capabilities the plan creates will have the same launch and re-entry trajectories as ICBMs – They’ll get mistaken for nuclear attacks and cause nuclear escalation

The Law We Fund
Subtitle C—George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey
SEC. 321. GEORGE E. BROWN, JR. NEAR-EARTH OBJECT SURVEY.
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the ‘‘George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act’’.
(b) FINDINGS.—The Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth’s species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.
(2) Similar objects have struck the Earth or passed through the Earth’s atmosphere several times in the Earth’s history and pose a similar threat in the future.
(3) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects’ closest approach to Earth, and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.
(4) The efforts taken to date by NASA for detecting and characterizing the hazards of near-Earth objects are not sufficient to fully determine the threat posed by such objects to cause widespread destruction and loss of life.
(c) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this section the term ‘‘near- Earth object’’ means an asteroid or comet with a perihelion distance of less than 1.3 Astronomical Units from the Sun.
(d) NEAR-EARTH OBJECT SURVEY.—
(1) SURVEY PROGRAM.—The Administrator shall plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such Deadline. near-Earth objects to the Earth. It shall be the goal of the Survey program to achieve 90 percent completion of its near-Earth object catalogue (based on statistically predicted populations
of near-Earth objects) within 15 years after the date of enactment of this Act.
(2) AMENDMENTS.—Section 102 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2451) is amended—
(A) by redesignating subsection (g) as subsection (h);
(B) by inserting after subsection (f) the following new subsection:
‘‘(g) The Congress declares that the general welfare and security of the United States require that the unique competence of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration be directed to detecting, tracking, cataloguing, and characterizing near-Earth asteroids and comets in order to provide warning and mitigation of the potential hazard of such near-Earth objects to the Earth.’’; and
(C) in subsection (h), as so redesignated by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, by striking ‘‘and (f)’’ and
inserting ‘‘(f), and (g)’’.
(3) FIFTH-YEAR REPORT.—The Administrator shall transmit to the Congress, not later than February 28 of the fifth year after the date of enactment of this Act, a report that provides the following:
(A) A summary of all activities taken pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.
(B) A summary of expenditures for all activities pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.
(4) INITIAL REPORT.—The Administrator shall transmit to Congress not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act an initial report that provides the following:
(A) An analysis of possible alternatives that NASA may employ to carry out the Survey program, including
ground-based and space-based alternatives with technical descriptions.
(B) A recommended option and proposed budget to carry out the Survey program pursuant to the recommended
option.
(C) Analysis of possible alternatives that NASA could employ to divert an object on a likely collision course with
Earth.
