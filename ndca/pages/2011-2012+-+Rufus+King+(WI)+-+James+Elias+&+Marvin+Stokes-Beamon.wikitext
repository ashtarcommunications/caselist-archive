==Kritiks== 

===Cult of Death Kritik=== 

**<span class="cite">__SUB POINT A IS DEATH__</span>**

**Their view of life is based on an egotistical interpretation of what it means to be human - we are nothing more than a particular arrangement of atoms, and the war they prevent is nothing more than a rearrangement of that matter. Two implications:**
**1) There is no impact to the 1AC - make them prove why human existence is somehow important**

**2) They establish hierarchies which lead to fascism - every example of human advancement has come at the expense of all other forms of life: we took life from trees and grass to build our home, we steal energy from the sun to know the world and we for some reason want to preserve human development so we can unlock the secrets of the universe. The impact is an ongoing genocide of all life in the universe**.

**<span class="cite">3) Inevitably, this is the logic that allows the worst forms of capitalist domination to continue, extending the death hand of docile bare-life as far as possible. In the end, death is not only inevitable, but the conditions created by capitalism make death desirable.</span>**
**Deleuze and Guattari 72**<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Anti-Oedipus, 330-39, 1972, Murray)</span>

But it seems … <span class="underline">up-a question of regime.</span>

**<span class="cite">__SUB POINT B IS THE ALTERNATIVE__</span>**

**<span class="cite">1) Our alternative is to problematize the foundations of the 1AC. This is the process of making something that was formerly seen as true into a complex mess of question which makes further action impossible due to the ethico-political deadlock created</span>**

**2) We open up the space to question why we allowed ourselves to become entrenched in fascist global capital and demand a more efficient tomorrow. Our alternative allows to escape the self-fulfilling prophecy of constant death prevention and actually achieve true change**
**<span class="cite">Deleuze and Guattari 72</span>**<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Anti-Oedipus, 366-8, 1972, Murray)</span>

<span class="underline">The</span> fourth and <span class="underline">… </span>ruins of institutions<span class="underline">”</span>

===Escapism Kritik=== 

**1) Link - The idea of space exploration, since the dream had been realized, was not surrounded by awe or joy, but by the simple idea of escape of the human condition**
**Arendt 58**<span style="font-size: 5pt;">(Hannah, German-American political theorist and philosopher, “The Human Condition”, 1958, JKE)</span>

**__This event__**, second … **__the earth forever."__**

**2) Implication - The drive for escape fuels the creation of artifice. The role of the ballot is not a question of whether or not artifice will be created, but if it is the right thing to do. Allowing artifice to takeover human life and dehumanizing the average person by removing all that makes us human**
**Arendt 58**<span style="font-size: 5pt;">(Hannah, German-American political theorist and philosopher, “The Human Condition”, 1958, JKE)</span>

**__The earth__** is … **__how murderous it is.__**

**3) The Alternative is to reject the affirmative plan and individually reconsider the human condition**

**4) The Alt Solves – We have become a society in which we mindlessly rely on someone or something else for answers. The answers and solutions to the human condition don’t lie with one person, they lie in each and every one of us and are ours to discover and embody**
**Arendt 58**<span style="font-size: 5pt;">(Hannah, German-American political theorist and philosopher, “The Human Condition”, 1958, JKE)</span>

**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">To these preoccupations … we are doing.</span>__**

===Weaponitis Kritik=== 

**1) Focus on war as an isolated event produces a politics of crises control that attempts to manage outbreaks of violence from flashpoint to flashpoint. This mode of being reproduces militarism and perpetuates the structural violence of “peacetime militarism”**
**Cuomo 96**<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Chris Cuomo. Ph.D., 1992, University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Philosophy University of Cincinnati Hypatia Fall 1996.Vol.11, Iss. 4; pg. 30)</span>

**Sethi 89**<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, (J.D., __Gandhian Critique … Peace Movements__, page 174)</span>

Therefore, the threat … **__of nuclear weapons.__**

**5) The representations of the 1AC enforce a norm of negative peace, we should work to foster a more pacific discourse that promotes positive peace and social justice. It’s not what they do it’s what they justify- vote negative to reject the affirmatives description of peace as the absence of war**
**Gay 98**<span style="font-size: 5pt;">(William C Gay. Ph.D. in Philosophy from Boston College, Prof. UNC, Peace Review, Dec 1998.Vol.10, Iss. 4; pg. 545-8 )</span>
