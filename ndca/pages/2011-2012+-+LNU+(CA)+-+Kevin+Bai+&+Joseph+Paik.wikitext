__**Advantage 2: Existential Threats**__

**<span style="font-family: Arial;">Multiple existential threats from space and on earth means we get off the rock now - geographic isolation supercharges every single impact and makes extinction inevitable in the status quo.

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">There are several reasons that motivate the establishment of a permanent Mars colony. </span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial;">And empirics show that all existential threats on earth have intensified– resource depletion, disease, droughts, famine, climate change, asteroid strikes. Habitation on another planet is inevitable</span>**

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Earth won't always be fit for occupation</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial;">Existential risks shatter conventional “time frame” arguments - its in its own category where we only have to be wrong once before extinction. Short term focus masks longer term trends and makes extinction inevitable – turns its own ends.</span>**

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Why tackle 1000 years and not shorter, more imaginable and manageable time horizons? </span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial;">Mars habitation is the only viable life insurance policy---we won’t be able to predict what causes extinction until it happens which means all counter-measures will inevitably fail. </span>**

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Probability can be understood in different senses, but most relevant here </span><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">is the epistemic sense in which probability is construed as</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">(something like) </span><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">the credence that an ideally reasonable observer should assign to the risk’s materializing based on currently available evidence</span>

===<span style="font-family: Arial;">Deleuze Kritik</span>=== 

**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The call for technology, a new form of energy, is not neutral – these drives are existent everywhere around us but continue to fail. And as we pile up our new toys, fresh out of the package and already broken with no warranty, the disparities between worlds grow. The problem is not technology, rather it is the self.</span>**
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">**Guattari 89** (Pierre-Félix</span><span class="cite" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">was a French militant, institutional psychotherapist and philosopher, a founder of both schizoanalysis and ecosophy. "The Three Ecologies" </span><span class="cite" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">1989</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">, pp. 31-32)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">So, wherever we turn, there is the same nagging paradox: on the one hand,</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Inevitably, this is the logic that allows the worst forms of capitalist domination to continue, extending the death hand of docile bare-life as far as possible. In the end, death is not only inevitable, but the conditions created by capitalism makes death desirable.</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Deleuze and Guattari 72</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> (Anti-Oedipus, 330-39, Murray)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">But it seems that things are becoming very obscure, for what is this distinction</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Our alternative is to problematize the foundations of the 1AC.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">This is a process of making something that was formerly seen as true into a complex and uncertain mess of questions, making further action impossible because we have an ethico-political deadlock in the form of a problem. We open up the space to question why we allowed ourselves to become entrenched in fascist global capital and demand a more efficient tomorrow.</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Deleuze and Guattari 72 (</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Anti-Oedipus, 366-8)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The fourth and </span><span class="underline" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">final thesis of schizoanalysis is </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">therefore</span>

===**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">Capitalism Kritik</span>**=== 

**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The plan is a last ditch effort at averting crisis by making an ‘outer spatial fix’ to resolve the core contradictions of capitalism</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Dickens 10 </span>**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">(Peter, Affiliated Lecturer in the Department of Sociology, Faculty of Politics, Psychology, Sociology and International Studies , University of Cambridge, "The Humanization of the Cosmos—To What End?," [https://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end] AD: 6-29-11, jam)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The Cosmos: Capitalism’s New “Outside” **__Instead of indulging in over-optimistic and fantastic visions,we should take a__** longer, harder, and more **__critical look at what is happening__** and what is likely to happen.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Capitalism reduces everything to market abstractions—negates value to life and makes extinction inevitable</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Kovel 2 </span>**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">(Joel, Professor of Social Studies at Bard , “The Enemy of Nature,” p140-141)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The precondition of an ecologically rational attitude toward nature **__is the recognition that nature far surpasses us and has its own intrinsic value, irreducible to our practice__**.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Our alternative is to vote negative to refuse to participate in activities which support capitalism. We must hollow out capitalist structures by refusing to invest our energy in reforms and rescue operations</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Herod 04 </span>**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">(James, Getting Free, http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/06.htm)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">It is time to try to describe, at first abstractly and later concretely, a strategy for **__destroying capitalism__**. This strategy, at its most basic, **__calls for pulling time, energy, and resources out of capitalist civilization__**</span>

===**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">Taoism Kritik</span>**=== 

**__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Live</span>__****<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> __in__ __the__ __present__: looking to the future makes life meaningless and denies any benefits your action would have</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Watts</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">, **51** (Dean of the American Academy of Asian Studies and research fellow at Harvard University, **51** (Alan, //The Wisdom of Insecurity//, pg 51-2)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">But __in the process of symbolizing the universe__in this way or that __for this purpose or that we__ seem to __have **lost the actual joy and meaning of life** itself__.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The alternative is to take no action to create desired ends—</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Kirkland 96</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> (Russel, professor of Asian religions and Taoism at the University of Georgia, “The Book of the Way,”)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Specifically, __the Tao is humble__, __yielding__, __and non-assertive__.</span>
