<span style="font-size: 16pt;">**__The E-Lusion - Narrative for 1AC/1NC__**</span>
<span style="font-size: 16pt;">It’s called the prologue, the preface, the beginning, my narrative, the reason why I spit, I flow, and rhyme. Its starts at, the beginning, the prologue, my narrative, when I wake up in the morning and realize that our youth is losing their culture and pride, They have become color blind to the real world, and as I stand here I see it with my own eyes. The brutality of it all as equivalent to when I walk out the door of my house only to see another black body brutalized by law enforcement and to hear the sounds of gunshots blasting like the speed reading of a policy debate round. No communication, no education. The gentrification of our voice like the gentrification of our hoods. It’s like the debate community is pushing us out, pushing my voice out and where do I go from here. Become homeless because I was forced out. Forced to reside within the Brownfield’s of the debate community because our voice was not on their right field, get it a bright field! We are not here to throw up stacks and bring turf wars. Traditional vs. Nontraditional. Is it Bloods vs. Crips, yet reality vs. fiat? Imprisoned like the Panoptic borders of a nation built on the back bones of immigrants forced to obtain the permanent residency to the debate community, under the rain of emotional stimulants prescribed to the 9 month pregnant woman due to give birth to our style our culture Hip-Hop, within the unhealthy corporate oppressive market co- modified environment. It is the unhealthy factors of the debate community like military recruiters; they recruit to be the future of our country, a future void of morality. Like father like son, like teacher like student, like the state like administration. If this community mirrors the political pollution, like the board of ED, the people will not be engaged. We are asleep, hit with a home run to the head as we forget our identity, while the wind takes out brain away and we become vegetables to the state. Domestically abused by the aggressive nature of this activity, within its elites mindset. Evicting us out for our lack of resources under the impression that our school is yes pink…. Pink Like the panther mysteriously lacking critical pedagogy to keep us engaged, and so they drop. Dropped in a disruptive vibe. Becoming airheads, in a world of realistic but unrealistic ideologies. Profiled like the face books of this society let alone our racial ethnicity. Forgetting what’s moral, forgetting what’s right. My narrative, the beginning, the reason why I rhyme. **__This is the United States of amnesia.__** </span>

<span style="font-size: 16pt;">**__The ballot or the bullet:__** </span>

<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11pt;">The c</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">onfining of debate to policy-making and legislative simulation not only excludes (non-experts) organic experts like us; it also contributes to the legitimacy of ruling social structures and their attendant violence**. Hip-Hop has become a global language.** </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">**Perspectives of color are essential for the revolution. Unless debate changes to accommodate voices of oppressed, Elitism will continue to rule,**</span>

<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">**"Unless debate is fundamentally transformed. (And) until the voices of economically and racially marginalized persons are given equal weight in debate round with those of affluent white experts (whose expertise is only presumed because other whites published what they had to say in the first place), the ideas that shape our world will continue to be those of the elite, no matter how destructive these ideas have proven to be for the vast majority of the planets inhabitants."**</span>

<span style="font-size: 16pt;">**__Verse # 4: U.S of Hypocrisy__**</span>

**The great American dream, in all its gleam,**
**Or so it seems the loyalty to ponzi schemes.**
**So I double team to blow out the steam,**
**Bar scanning the world reads so sweet flaws whipping the cream.**
**So I’m shooting the beam, reality still burning the team,**
**Freedom lies if you know what I mean.**
**I’m a child to bureaucracy, lyrical autocracy,**
**Theocracy is my philosophy to democracy, “Hypocrisy”**
**I’ma spit it up chronologically,**
**Psychologically meaning in order for numerology. Pause!**
**Lets talk about the country in reference**
**Lets talk about the people troops and cops in preference,**
**Lets take a simple look into this racist society,**
**Locality forms normality**
**Profiling morality**
**Internal totality, amusement of their power mentality**
**Within the actual war ridden fatality.**

**Verse 2**
**Yo reduce do you know what it means?**
**U.S Universal status that’s how it seems**
**The police are their apparatus pawns on the scene**
**Gangs are dehumanize by the way that they lean**
**Corporate pockets is just coping the green**
**They incarcerate recruiting us to the free labor team**
**Prison was never my preordained destiny**
**Nightfall comes cops pointing the beam**
**Look at us now who are considering the fiends?**
**Its like the black body is the fix that they need**
**Addicted to that word brutality**
**All of yall can concede to reality**
**Sean Bell 50 bullets a calamity**
**Stop profiling me white supremacy**
**How many more black bodies have to bleed?**
**Can the black body ever be free?**
