The neg burden is to prove a morally relevant distinction between all humans and all animals.

Reason is our fundamental basis of understanding. David Velleman. Self To Self. 2006. Cambridge University Press. "As we have seen...act for reasons."

In order to even make sense of their actions, they must first have a reason for acting that way in the first place. David Velleman, ‚ÄúA Theory of Value,‚Äù Ethics 118:3 [2008]. "Whereas most philosophers...response into another."

Autonomy derives from reason. David Velleman. Self To Self. 2006. Cambridge University Press. "Even if we...our own behavior."

If we respect ourselves as autonomous, we must universalize that respect. David Velleman. Self To Self. 2006. Cambridge University Press. "Whenever we act...principle of duty."

Standard - Consistency with autonomous will

Autonomy differs from free will in that we can still come to pre-determined conclusions via reason. David Velleman. Self To Self. 2006. Cambridge University Press. "The fact that...that it is."

I CONTEND THAT THE RECOGNITION OF ANIMAL RIGHTS IS NECESSARY FOR CONSISTENCY WITH OUR AUTONOMOUS WILL.

First, because animals are self-maintaining entities capable of experiencing suffering, they must be allowed to pursue that end. Christine Korsgaard, "Fellow Creatures: Kantian Ethics and Our Duties to Animals."
http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~korsgaar/CMK.FellowCreatures.pdf

Second, even if we believe that we are intrinsically valuable because of our rationality and not our animal nature, that would just concede that animal nature is important. Christine Korsgaard, "Persons, Animals, and the Law."
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">[[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~korsgaar/CMK.Personhood.pdf]]</span>. "So the way...who have interests."

This would require the recognition of animal rights, even if animals couldn‚Äôt recognize those rights themselves.
Christine Korsgaard, "Persons, Animals, and the Law."
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">[[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~korsgaar/CMK.Personhood.pdf]]</span>. "Does this show...the legal bifurcation."

it doesn‚Äôt matter if they can‚Äôt participate in moral discussion; by legislating laws, we can re-affirm that they have value.
Christine Korsgaard, "Fellow Creatures: Kantian Ethics and Our Duties to Animals."
http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~korsgaar/CMK.FellowCreatures.pdf. "But actually he...the other animals."

Acting in a way that is arbitrary disrupts reason.

Contention 2: Animals should be offered basic legal rights. 
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">We give children rights based on the notion that they have interests and a minimum level of autonomy. </span>
