**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 14px;">No efforts to protect US transportation infrastructure now from climate change – it will be destroyed and mitigation cannot solve fast enough</span>**
**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 14px;">Frankel 12</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> (11/8/12, Emil H Frankel is a visiting scholar from the Bipartisan Policy Center,” “Growing Risks: How do we choose?”[[http://transportation.nationaljournal.com/2012/11/sandys-infrastructure-legacy.php?comments=expandall#comments|http://transportation.nationaljournal.com/2012/11/sandys-infrastructure-legacy.php?comments=expandall#comments]]) </span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Concern about adaptation to climate change and, partcularly, to rising sea levels has grown among transportation executives and policy makers over the last few years,as it has becomeincreasingly evident that significant steps to mitigate these trends(aside from the implementation of more rigorous fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles) are unlikely to occur in the near future and would, in any event, come too late to alter the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions already in the atmosphere ... As is true in so much else in the area of infrastructure, we first need to reform the institutions at all levels of government by which we assess, analyze, and make investment decisions.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Over the 20th century, the atmospheric concentrations of key greenhouse gases increased due to human activities ... </span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">These and other dangers pose substantial challenges to humanity and nature, with a magnitude that is directly linked to the peak level of carbon dioxide reached.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The transportation planners, designers, and operators of this nation's transportation systems face many daunting concerns, not the least of which is funding to maintain and improve the country's infrastructure and competitiveness ... Nowhere will the impacts of climate change be more apparent than on the vast transportation network of this country.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 14px;">Collapses the economy</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The massive network of seaports, waterways, railroads, and highways we built in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were designed to unlock the nation's natural resources, agriculture, and manufacturing strengthand bring these products to market ... We can show that we value these systems by agreeing to pay for their upkeep or own both the responsibility for economic decline and its consequences.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 14px;">Global economic decline leads to miscalculation and crisis escalation - escalates</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Increased Potential for Global Conflict Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is likely to be the result of a number of intersecting and interlocking forces ... With water also becoming scarcer in Asia and the Middle East, cooperation to manage changing water resources is likely to be increasingly difficult both within and between states in a more dog-eat-dog world.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 14px;">US climate adaptation policy key to climate leadership—US actions allow for global adaptation dialogue—that restores US influence</span>**

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 14px;">Jacobs et al, ’10</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> [2010, Katharine L.

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">America’s climate choices regarding limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapting to climate change impacts will be implemented in a global context ... </span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Overall, the chapter highlights the importance of building solutions and making decisions on adaptation options within a broad international context (Bales and Duke, 2008; Bang et al., 2007; World Bank, 2010). </span>


**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 14px;">Structural factors mean that US adaptation policy gets modeled</span>**

Jacobs works at University of Arizona, and other members of the Panel on Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change; National Research Council, “Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change”, [[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12783]]]</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Opportunities for “Mainstreaming” Climate Change Adaptation Activities into Existing U.S. Programs U.S. decisions aboutclimate change adaptations at both national and international scales will take place in the context ofexisting treaties, trade relationships, resource extraction and processing networks, international development assistance, andglobal markets ... Such trade agreements couldtherefore include adaptation standards as part of their environmental standards in particular in promoting more sustainable agricultural practices. </span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 14px;">Failure to seriously fund adaptation kills the credibility of global efforts—US engagement is critical</span>**
**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 14px;">Jacobs et al, ’10</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> [2010, Katharine L.

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Considering the Role of the United States in Global Adaptation Activities In fact, adaptation may involve significant transformations rather than incremental changes,some of which will be painful to those in societies reluctant to, or not able to, embrace change ... </span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Some are benevolent, and some are self-in terested; but in combination they make a compelling case for a significant U.S. role in international climate change adaptation. </span>


**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 14px;">Action on climate adaptation reverses the negative perception of US hard power and solves soft power</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The Pentagon is the best resourced arm of the government, but there are limits to what hard power can achieve on its own ... It can happen again. </span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 14px;">Soft power solves a laundry list of extinction threats, turns your war scenarios</span>**
**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 14px;">Jervis ‘9</span>** <span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">[Robert Jervis is a Professor of International Politics at Columbia, “Unipolarity: A Structural Perspective,” World Politics, Muse, </span>


<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">To say that the system is unipolar is not to argue that the unipole can get everything it wantsor that it has no need for others ... Building the world that the U.S. seeks is a political, social, and even psychological task for which unilateral measures are likely to be unsuited and for which American military and economic strength can at best play a supporting role. Success requires that others share the American vision and believe that its leadership is benign. </span>


**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 14px;">Independently, hegemony shorn of international support causes extinction</span>**

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 14px;">Ikenberry ’02</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> [John Ikenberry, Professor of Geopolitics and Global Justice @ Georgetown, October 2002, "America's Imperial Ambition—Foreign Affairs, lexis] </span>


<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Pitfalls accompany this neoimperial grand strategy, however. Unchecked U.S. power, shorn of legitimacyand disentangled from the postwar norms and institutions of the international order, will usher in a more hostile international system, making it far harder to achieve American interests ... But history shows that powerful states tend totrigger self-encirclementby their own overestimation of their power. </span>

Holsinger Pew Center On Global Climate Change, “Adapting to Climate Change: A Call for Federal Leadership”,[[http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/adaptation-federal-leadership.pdf]]]</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The federal government has a critical role to playin an effective and coordinated approach to climate change¶ adaptation in the United States ... However, this kind of coordination likely requires significant funding as an¶ incentive and may require involvement by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to ensure the success of¶ interagency efforts. </span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Providing information on climate forecasts to infrastructure engineers and planners will not be sufficient to achieve adaptation goals, for two reasons ... Infrastructure engineers accustomed to designing infrastructure using historical climate data will need to assess a much broader range of future outcomes, and look for robust adaptive measures, which might include such counterintuitive adjustments as designing these assets with shorter lives. </span>


**<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 14px;">It prevents the destruction of infrastructure</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">A range of adaptation and resiliency strategies are necessary to address the various climate change impacts to the transportation systemdiscussed in the preceding section ...
