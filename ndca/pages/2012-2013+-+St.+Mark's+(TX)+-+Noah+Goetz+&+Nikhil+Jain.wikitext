<span style="font-size: 6pt;">This paper will analyse the threat of cyber terrorism in regard to nuclear weapons. Specifically, this research will use open source knowledge to identify the structure of nuclear command and control centres, how those structures might be compromised through computer network operations, and how doing so would fit within established cyber terrorists’ capabilities, strategies, and tactics. </span>__If access to c____ommand and control centres is obtained, terrorists could fake or actually **causeone nuclear-armed state to attack another,**thus **provoking a nuclear response from another nuclear power**. This may be an easier alternative for terrorist groups than building or acquiring a nuclear weapon or dirty bomb themselves. This would also act as a force equaliser, and provide terrorists with the asymmetric benefits of high speed, removal of geographical distance, and a relatively low cost.__ __Continuing difficulties in developing computer tracking technologies which could trace the identity of intruders,__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and difficulties in establishing an internationally agreed upon legal framework to guide responses to computer network operations, </span>__point towards an inherent weakness in using computer networks to manage nuclear weaponry.

Rather than asking for a financial return, however, they will be asking for free access to technology in the developing world, while leaving the innovator to profit in major markets--not a bad deal. The non-profit foundation made its first-ever equity investment earlier this year in Liquidia Technologies, which is working on immune system decoys.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Of course, </span>**__the number one way to return the biotech ecosystem to full health is to build a__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> healthy </span>**__economy in which there is more appetite for risk__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

He went on to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley and received a Ph.D. in 1972. In 1973, he held a lectureship at Princeton University. Michio continues Einstein’s search for a “Theory of Everything,” seeking to unify the four fundamental forces of the universe—the strong force, the weak force, gravity and electromagnetism. He is the author of several scholarly, Ph.D. level textbooks and has had more than 70 articles published in physics journals, covering topics such as superstring theory, supergravity, supersymmetry, and hadronic physics. Professor of Physics — He holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York, where he has taught for over 25 years. He has also been a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, as well as New York University (NYU). “Physics of the Future” http://213.55.83.52/ebooks/physics/Physics%20of%20the%20Future.pdf Accessed 6/26/12 BJM</span>
