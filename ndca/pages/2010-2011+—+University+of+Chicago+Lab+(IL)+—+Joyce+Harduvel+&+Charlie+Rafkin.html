<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The</span> 2011 <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Senate patent reform bill</span> - <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">as the near-unanimous</span> Senate <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">vote underscores</span> - <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">passed as a result of genuine bipartisan</span> consultation and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">compromise</span></u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Senators Patrick </span><u>Leahy</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (D-Vt), Charles </span><u>Grassley</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (R-IA), and Oren </span><u>Hatch</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (R-Utah), chairman and ranking minority members respectively of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and their staffs, </span><u>spent many hours over the past two years working through the complicated substantive issues</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> while attempting to accommodate diverse corporate sector interests and priorities. They received crucial help from Sen. John Kyle (R-AR.), whose staff crafted a breakthrough amendment and compromise on one of the most debated and contentious elements of the legislation (rules for administrative appeal hearings after the U.S. Patent Office has granted a patent). </span><br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>The <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">economic significance </span>of the patent system -- and the importance of &quot;getting it right&quot; on legislative reform -- <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is underscored by numerous studies</span>.</u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In the United States, </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>an estimated 30-<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">40 percent of the gains in</span> productivity and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">economic growth</span> throughout the 20th century <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have been attributed to innovation</span> in its various forms.</u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2005, economists Kevin Hassett and Robert Shapiro calculated that the value of U.S. intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trademarks) was $5-5.5 trillion. </span><br />
<u>Within this world of knowledge and ideas, the patent system occupies a central place</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> - a fact recognized by the Founding Fathers, who enshrined intellectual property in Article 8 of the Constitution, granting limited monopoly to inventors, artists and writers to &quot;promote the progress in Science and the Useful Arts.&quot; </span><br />
<u>The U.S. patent system has evolved over time, and while in the broadest context it has worked quite well, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">problems and impediments to innovation have accumulated in recent decade</span>s</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The </span><u>challenge for the Congress, then, has been to craft <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">targeted changes</span> to the existing system that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">will remove those impediments</span>, while retaining the flexibility and dynamism to adjust to future needs of U.S. entrepreneurs</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> across diverse technological fields and sectors. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">S. 23, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the bill</span> passed by the Senate, largely accomplishes these goals: it <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">harmonizes U.S.</span> patent <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">policy with other nations'</span> practices; it <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">creates an</span> administrative <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">appeals system that</span> carefully <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">balances</span> the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">rights of</span> patent <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">applicants with challengers</span>; and it removes a number of subjective elements that have crept into the patent system</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Finally - of equal importance - </span><u>the Senators have exercised restraint in not second-guessing the courts in areas where judicial decisions are already settling a number of difficult questions.</u> <br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Specifically, </span><u>the Senate bill brings the United States into harmony with other national patent systems by <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">changing to a first</span>-inventor-<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to-file system</span> from the existing first-to-invent system.</u> <u>The <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">present practice has produced endless controversy</span> - and litigation - <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">over who actually had first inventor rights</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Taking into account the concerns of some small inventors and academics, the legislation also provides a &quot;grace period&quot; of one year, <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">during which the inventor's own disclosure (through a research article, for instance) would not defeat the right to obtain a patent. </span></strong></u><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Second, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the bill attempts to mitigate the huge costs of</span> patent <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">litigation</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (average patent court litigations costs:$4-5 million) </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by</span> establishing a post-grant administrative procedure aimed at <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">settling challenges in a</span> less costly and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">more expeditious fashion</span>. S. 23 creates a 9-month window after a patent has been granted for an administrative proceeding in which any third party may challenge the initial determination of the patent office. It also continues a more constricted reexamination procedure (</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">a so-called second window) that can be requested after the conclusion of the first appeal. These reexamination appeals, however, can only raise questions of novelty and non-obviousness derived from existing patents or printed material. Deadlines for both procedures ensure prompt action. </span><br />
<u>Third, the new legislation curtails or eliminates certain subjective elements of the patent process, the most significant being the requirement for an inventor to describe the &quot;best mode&quot; or practice of his or her invention - or risk later challenges or invalidation</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>The Senate removes a failure to disclose best mode as a defense for patent validity.</u> <br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Finally, </span><u>the Senate has wisely not attempted to second guess the federal courts in a number of areas where they have addressed difficult issues through interpretation of existing law.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> For instance, in one case, eBay v. mercExchange, the Supreme Court effectively reined in the excessive use of permanent injunctions by so-called patent &quot;trolls,&quot; who had used the patent system to extort payments just to get out of the way. And in a second area, developing case law has established practical, appropriate principles for determining damages for patent infringement. As Dan Burk, a leading patent legal scholar, has stated: &quot;a judicial response is often the fastest and most efficient way to address emerging issues.&quot; </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX), and second ranking minority member Howard Berman (D.-CAL) both have long bipartisan experience and expertise in the area of patent law. In draft form (The bill has been published and will be formally introduced this week), the House bill is quite close to the Senate bill on most issues. </span><br />
<u>There is thus the expectation that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in the coming weeks the House will also pass</span> a <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">patent reform</span> bill by a sizeable majority. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Then</span> it will be up to the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">congressional leaders</span> in both parties to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">shepherd a final product through a conference committee</span> and on to the president for enactment <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">before Congress departs</span> in the fall.</u> <br />

<u>As <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the</span> U.S. Senate began debate Feb. 28 on a <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">patent reform bill</span>, S. 23, six <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">years in the making</span>, the Obama administration   in a “Statement of Administration Policy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” reinforced by a Commerce Department press conference the next day. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span><u>The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 23,” the SAP began.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “As a whole, this bill represents a fair, balanced, and necessary effort to improve patent quality, enable greater work sharing between the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and other countries, improve service to patent applicants and the public at the USPTO, and offer productive alternatives to costly and complex litigation.” </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">During the March 1 press conference, Commerce Secretary Gary F. </span><u>Locke said, “The stars are aligned better than ever before,” predicting that Congress will pass a bill this year.</u> <br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">However, it is clear that the current S. 23 will be modified before patent reform can be finalized, as the administration acknowledged that key provisions are still being negotiated by key stakeholders. </span><br />
<!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:183:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@a0c6n2y5k2&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: a0c6n2y5k2&quot;/&gt; --><a name="a0c6n2y5k2"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:183 --><span style="font-size: 8pt;">'The America Invents Act.' </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Originally titled “The Patent Reform Act of 2011,” S. 23 was renamed “The America Invents Act” as its primary sponsor, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) began debate on the legislation in the Senate Feb. 28. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">When the floor action continued March 1, Leahy added the SAP into the Senate record and said, “I thank all those from the administration who worked on this matter and, in particular, Secretary Locke, Director [David J.] Kappos of the Patent and Trademark Office and former [Commerce] Secretary [William M.] Daley.” </span><br />
<u>The bill was reported unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Feb. 3 (81 PTCJ 451, 2/11/11). Most of its provisions are now geared to modifying or adding procedures at the PTO, though a few provisions directed to litigation remain. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">One probable floor amendment would put an end to Congress's right to take fees collected by the PTO and use the funds for other governmental purposes.

<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The administration appears to be gearing up for a debate over</span> S. 23's provision that would require a <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">switch from</span> the current <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">first-to-invent</span> system for determining inventorship <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to</span> a <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">first</span>-inventor-<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to-file</span> system</u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, the proposed adoption of such a system is one of only two provisions in the bill specifically endorsed in the SAP. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“By moving the United States to a first-to-file system, the bill simplifies the process of acquiring rights,” according to the SAP. “This essential provision will reduce legal costs, improve fairness, and support U.S. innovators seeking to market their products and services in a global marketplace.” </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">During the Commerce Department press conference, </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Kappos made a point to assure independent inventors and small businesses--the most vocal critics</span> of the first-inventor-to-file provision--<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that the change will advance their claims</span> to ownership of inventions rather than favor large corporations.</u> </span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>second provision cited favorably by the SAP--<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">granting fee-setting authority to the PTO</span>--has also been welcomed enthusiastically by most stakeholders</u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That provision, the administration said, would allow the PTO “to establish and adjust its fees to reflect changes in costs, demand, and workload, the bill would enhance productivity--reducing delay in the patent application process--and ensure full cost recovery at no taxpayer expense.” </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The American Intellectual Property Law Association and the Intellectual Property Owners Association, however, have argued that the fee-setting provision must be tied to a provision banning fee diversion. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Both </span><u>Kappos and Locke addressed the fee-diversion controversy in the press conference. Kappos noted that a ban on such reallocation of PTO resources is embedded in the president's fiscal year 2012 budget</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (81 PTCJ 483, 2/18/11). He was referring to the statement in the budget, “That the receipts collected as a result of these surcharges shall be available within the amounts provided herein to the United States Patent and Trademark Office without fiscal year limitation, for all authorized activities and operations of the Office.” </span><br />
<u>Locke predicted operational problems unless the agency can keep its fees</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “Having fees diverted does not help us reform the patent process and get us down to what the industry wants” in terms of the pendency between patent application and a decision on its allowance, he said. “If we set our fees but the money is taken away, we could be going backwards, in fact,” he said, and the backlog of unexamined applications at the PTO may even increase. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Patent reform efforts over the past six year were initially focused largely on substantive changes affecting patent infringement litigation, but recent decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court attempted to resolve some of those issues--such as the standards for granting injunctive relief in patent infringement actions, and for awarding damages for willful infringement. However, proposals for litigation reform continued to spark debate as the patent lingered. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Indeed, the most contentious issue in the last Congress was on the calculation of damages--despite the Federal Circuit attempts to clarify its jurisprudence on that issue over the past two years. Damages reform is proposed again in S. 23, and so is venue language limiting transfers of patent cases out of patentee-friendly courts--a topic that has also received considerable recent attention by the Federal Circuit. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Apparently recognizing the judicial advances, </span><u>the SAP suggested that damages and venue reform might no longer be needed. “The Administration would not object to removal of these provisions from the final version of the legislation,” according to the SAP.</u> <br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">However, </span><u>the SAP provided a hint that simply <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">deleting those two provisions and adding a ban on fee diversion will not address all </span>the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">anticipated concerns </span>of stakeholders<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> “<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with</span> the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Congress</span> to craft patent reform legislation that reflects sound policy and meets the needs of the Nation's innovators</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” the SAP concluded. </span><br />

According to one Taliban commander with direct knowledge of the meeting, they concluded that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">local forces allied to the Afghan government &quot;are in control of a growing number of areas</span> in the province <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and will</span> likely continue to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">expand since <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">local families and the government have encouraged their sons to participate</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.&quot; </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Assessing progress in a counterinsurgency is more art than science. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Body counts tend not to be helpful</span></u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">in measuring insurgent progress. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Nor do levels of violence</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Neither captures the combatants' primary goal: control over the population. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The Taliban have been remarkably transparent about their objectives and tactics. As the group announced in 2010 when it kicked off Operation al-Fath, or &quot;conquest,&quot; it aims to conduct a range of targeted assassinations in urban and rural areas to seize control of Afghanistan. &quot;May Allah help the mujahideen establish an Islamic government, keep the trenches of war hot against the aggressive infidels, and carry out their jihad,&quot; the Taliban announced. But after years of gains, the Taliban's progress has stalled—and even reversed—in southern Afghanistan this year. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">A recent NATO assessment indicated that Taliban control of territory had decreased since last year, with many of the Taliban's losses coming in the south, their most important sanctuary. Since late 2010, Taliban leader Mullah Omar and Sirajuddin Haqqani, a senior official in the Haqqani network, have acknowledged mounting losses, though they have vowed to retaliate. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">There appear to be several reasons for the Taliban's diminished ability to wage war. </span><br />
<u>One is the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">decision among Afghan and NATO leaders to establish a &quot;bottom-up&quot; component</span> of the campaign plan that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">allows Afghan communities to stand up for themselves</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>The Afghan <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Local Police</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> program, which was established in August by President Hamid Karzai, </span><u>has <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">undermined Taliban control</span> in Helmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan, and other provinces</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> by helping villagers protect their communities and better connecting them to district and provincial government. </span><br />
<u>The <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Afghan government and NATO</span> forces <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have been</span> fairly <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">meticulous</span> in choosing locations where locals have already resisted the Taliban, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">vetting</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> candidates with biometrics and available </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">intelligence</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">training and mentoring local villagers</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In some cases, the Afghan government has provided basic weapons and equipment to local communities for self-protection. The government and NATO forces have also helped ensure Afghan Local Police are small, defensive entities under the supervision of local shuras and control of the Interior Ministry. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The Taliban have taken notice. &quot;We must crush these efforts,&quot; another Taliban commander, who has been with the organization since 2002, told me in Kandahar province in February. &quot;And we must do it now.&quot; Taliban and other insurgent commanders are listening. Insurgent attacks against the Afghan government and NATO forces have nearly doubled from levels at the beginning of 2010, though so have civilian casualties caused by the Taliban. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">A second reason for the decline in Taliban control appears to be </span><u>the surge in conventional military forces, especially in eastern and southern Afghanistan</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. There are currently nearly 70,000 NATO forces in the south, up from 20,000 in April 2009. In Helmand province, for example, </span><u>U.S. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Marine</span> Corps <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and Afghan National Army forces have conducted a range of dismounted patrols, targeting insurgent sanctuaries and working</span> closely <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">with</span> tribal and other <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">community leaders</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> One of the most notable successes has been the recent agreement with the Alikozai tribe in Sangin district, an insurgent stronghold, to halt insurgent attacks on coalition forces and expel Taliban fighters. </span><br />
<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">These</span> factors have <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">placed the Taliban in a difficult position</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>When asked who they would rather have ruling Afghanistan today</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">86 percent of Afghans said</span> the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Karzai government</span> and only 9 percent the Taliban</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, according to a December poll by ABC News, BBC, ARD, and the Washington Post. When asked who posed the biggest danger in the country, 64 percent of respondents said the Taliban, up from 41 percent in 2005. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">It's not difficult to see why the Taliban are unpopular. In the 1990s, the Taliban closed cinemas and banned music, along with almost every other conceivable kind of entertainment. Most Afghans don't subscribe to their religious zealotry. Indeed, </span><u>most Muslims elsewhere in the world would also disavow the severity of the Taliban's puritanism</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Some evidence indicates, moreover, that the top officials in the Barack Obama administration now see the program more as an incentive for the Pakistani military to take a more aggressive posture toward the militants rather than as an effective tool against the insurgents. </span><br />
Although <u>the <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">strikes</span></span></strong></u> have been sold to the U.S. public as a way to weaken and disrupt al Qaeda, <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">which is an explicitly counter-terrorist objective</span></u></span></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, <u>al Qaeda is not actually the main threat</u></span> <u>to U.S. security emanating from Pakistan</u>, according to some analysts. <u>The <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">real threat comes from the broader</span></u>, rapidly <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">growing insurgency of Islamic militants</span> against the shaky Pakistani government</u> and military, they observe, and the drone strikes are a strategically inappropriate approach to that problem. <br />
<u>&quot;Al Qaeda has very little to do with the militancy in the tribal areas of Pakistan</u>,&quot; said Marvin Weinbaum, former Afghanistan and Pakistan analyst at the Bureau of Intelligence Research at the U.S. Department of State and now scholar-in-residence at the Middle East Institute. <br />
John McCreary, a senior intelligence analyst for the Defense Intelligence Agency until his retirement in 2006, agrees with Weinbaum’s assessment. &quot;The drone program is supposed to be all about al Qaeda,&quot; he told IPS in an interview, but in fact, &quot;<u>the threat is much larger.&quot;</u> <br />
McCreary observes that the <span style="font-size: 8pt;">targets</span> in recent months &quot;have been expanded to include Pakistani Pashtun militants.&quot; The administration apparently had dealt with that contradiction by effectively broadening the definition of al Qaeda, according to McCreary <br />
Ambassador James <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Dobbins</span>, the director of National Security Studies at the Rand Corporation, who maintains contacts with a range of administration national security officials, told IPS in an interview that the <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">drone strikes in Pakistan are aimed &quot;in the short</span> and medium <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">term&quot; at the counter-terrorism objective of preventing attacks on Washington</span> and other capitals.</u> <br />
But as they have shifted to Pakistani Taliban targets, Dobbins said, &quot;<u>To degree the targets are insurgents and are Pakistanis not Arabs it would be correct to assess that they are part of an insurgency</u>.&quot; That raises the question, he said, whether the <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">drone program &quot;is feeding the insurgency and popular support for it.&quot;</span></u> <br />

<u>Since the nineteenth century, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">geographers have developed theories</span> of “environmental determinism” <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that reject the <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">humanist interpretation of history as constituted solely through human-to-human interactions</span></strong></span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> By contrast, </span><u>they emphasized that environmental factors such as physical terrain and climate determined psychological outlooks</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and temperaments, cultural characteristics, social organization, and historical change. Once introduced into historiography as a crucial perspective mediated with other perspectives such as economics, class, technology, and culture in a non-reductionist manner that does not ignore the influence of social factors and the ability of humans to shape their environments as well, “environmental determinism” (read: “conditioning”) greatly bolsters our abilities to understand biological evolution, social development, and human behavior. </span><br />

A core thesis of what I call “</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">animal standpoint theory</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” is that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">animals have been <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">key driving and shaping forces of human thought, psychology, </span></em></span><em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">moral and social life, and history </span></em>overall. More specifically, animal standpoint theory argues that <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the oppression of human over human has deep roots in the oppression of human over animal</span></span></em>.<span style="mso-endnote-id: edn1;">[[file:<em>/C:/Users/Charlie Rafkin/Documents/My Dropbox/UC Lab Debate/Kritiks/Speciesism-Kritik-TOC-Charlie-Don'tBreak.doc#_edn1|</u>[i]<u>]]</span></u> <br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In this context, Charles Patterson’s recent book, </em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust</span><em>, articulates the animal standpoint in a powerful form with revolutionary implications. The main argument of </em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Eternal Treblinka</span><em> is that the </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">human domination of animals</span>, such as it emerged some ten thousand years ago with the rise of agricultural society, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">was the first hierarchical domination and laid the groundwork for patriarchy, slavery, warfare, genocide, and other systems of violence and power</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A key implication of Patterson’s theory is that </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>human liberation is implausible if disconnected from animal liberation</u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and </span><u>thus <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">humanism</span></strong> -- a <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"></em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">speciesist</span><em> philosophy that constructs a hierarchal relationship privileging superior humans over inferior animals</span></strong> and <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">reduces animals to resources for human use</span></strong> -- collapses under the weight of its logical contradictions.</u>  <br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Patterson lays out his complex holistic argument in three parts. In Part I, he demonstrates that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">animal exploitation and speciesism have direct</span> and profound <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">connections to slavery</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">colonialism, racism, and anti-Semitism</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In Part II, he shows how these </span><u>connections exist <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">not only in the realm of ideology</span> – <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">as conceptual systems of justifying</span> and underpinning <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">domination</span> and hierarchy – but <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">also in systems of technology</span></span></strong>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">such that the tools and techniques humans devised for</span> the rationalized <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">mass confinement and slaughter</span> of animals <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">were mobilized against human groups for the same ends</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, in the fascinating interviews and narratives of Part III, Patterson describes how personal experience with German Nazism prompted Jewish to take antithetical paths: whereas most retreated to an insular identity and dogmatic emphasis on the singularity of Nazi evil and its tragic experience, others recognized </span><u>the profound similarities between how Nazis treated their human captives and how humanity as a whole treats other animals, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">an epiphany</span> that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">led them to adopt vegetarianism</span>, to become advocates for the animals, and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">develop a far broader and more inclusive ethic</span> informed by universal compassion for all suffering and oppressed beings.</u> <br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While there is lively debate over whether or not Marx had an environmental consciousness, </span><u>there is no question he was a speciesist and the product of an obsolete anthropocentric/dominionist paradigm that continues to mar progressive social theory and politics</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">spectacle of Left speciesism is evident in the lack of articles</span></u> <u>―often due to a blatant refusal to consider animal rights issues</u><u>― <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">on animal exploitation in progressive journals</span>, magazines, and online sites</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As symptomatic of the prejudice, ignorance, provincialism, and non-holistic theorizing that is rife through the Left, consider the case of Michael Albert, a Chomskyian libertarian socialist and co-founder of </em>Z Magazine<em> and </em>Z Net<em>.

Moreover<u>, the point of the exhibit</u> – as true of Patterson’s book – <u>is not to reduce humans to animals, but rather to raise animals up into humans in the sense that they are accorded respect, granted their proper intrinsic value, and endowed with the rights relevant for them to lead lives based on freedom from pain and suffering and freedom to happiness and pleasure</u>.

<span style="tab-stops: 3.75in;">To give Dr. Martin Luther King a significantly broader reading that extends beyond the narrow limits of the human community to include all sentience life: “<em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">No one can be free until all are free</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span></span></em><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">” <u>There is a moral hypocrisy and speciesist double-standard</u></span> informing heated attacks on PETA’s attempts to draw parallels between animal and human suffering, one that desperately needs to be transcended in favor of a broader ethic. For while groups such as the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League ask PETA to be sensitive to human oppression, understanding that Blacks and Jews often accused PETA of barging into communities with their display and not appreciating how oppressed peoples might feel used or exploited to make moral arguments on behalf of animals. While these criticisms no doubt were valid in many cases, it must also be said that there were few attempts by oppressed people to make the effort from their side to try to <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">sympathize with and understand animal oppression</span></em>. While PETA may use images of Jewish and Black exploitation in ways they object to, it is more to the point to note that they eat animals in their private lives and groups functions, a considerable more grievous offense than a well-intended, possible misappropriation of images of suffering to expand the moral community. Indeed, the NAACP’s shameless public defense of serial dog torturer and killer Michael Vick was despicable and displayed a grotesque lack of moral sympathy to non-human animals, not fundamentally different from the detachment (if not pleasure) white racists showed toward those Blacks victimized by their violence </span><br />

If there is a salient disanalogy or discontinuity between the tyrannical pogroms launched against animals and humans, it lies not <u>in the fallacious assumption that animals do not suffer physical and mental pain similar to humans, but rather that animals suffer <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">more</span></em> than humans</u>, <u>both quantitatively (the intensity of their torture, such as they endure in fur farms, factory farms, and experimental laboratories) and qualitatively (the number of those who suffer and die).</u> And <u>while few oppressed human groups lack moral backing, sometimes on an international scale, one finds not mass solidarity with animals but rather mass consumption of them</u>. As another Nobel Prize writer in Literature, South African novelist writer J. M. Coetzee, forcefully stated: “Let me say it openly: <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">we are surrounded by an enterprise of degradation, cruelty, and killing which rivals anything the Third Reich was capable of, indeed dwarfs</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> it,</span> in that ours is an enterprise without end, self-regenerating, bringing rabbits, rats, poultry, livestock ceaselessly into the world for the purpose of killing them.”<span style="mso-endnote-id: edn3;">[[file:<em>/C:/Users/Charlie Rafkin/Documents/My Dropbox/UC Lab Debate/Kritiks/Speciesism-Kritik-TOC-Charlie-Don'tBreak.doc#_edn3|[iii]]]</span>  <br />

The machine of earlier times works in an exactly symmetrical way. If, in the machine of the moderns, the outside is produced through the exclusion of an inside and the inhuman produced by animalizing the human, here the inside is obtained through the inclusion of an outside, and <u>the non-man is produced by the humanization of an animal: the man-ape, the</u> </em><u>enfant sauvage</u><em> <u>or</u> </em><u>Homo ferus</u><em><u>, but also and above all the slave, the barbarian, and the foreigner, as figures of an animal in human form.</u> <br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is a further form of deixis which, in many respects, is even more enhabiting, and which, because it involves no metaphorical pointing, hardly even seems deictic. </span>The definite article can be used to refer to ‘this/our’ country and its inhabitants<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The </span>country need not be named to be indicated as the ground on which the figures of speech appear. “Across <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the</span></em> nation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">”, declared Tony Blair; “you, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the</span></em> people, who are our true heroes”, complimented Mandela, holding up the mirror of representation; Disraeli wanted to “live in the eye of <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the</span></em> country”. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Which country?

<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This deixis can do its business unobtrusively, running up the flag so discreetly that it is unnoticed even by speaker or writer. The nation does not need to be mentioned, let alone named. Pierre Achard (1993) analyzed a sentence in a British newspaper: “Government pressure has forced colleges to increase dramatically the number of students. He comments that the frame of the text is the nation, without being designated as such: “</span>Britain is the universe of the ongoing discourse<span style="font-size: 8pt;">”, although “the term ‘we’ is not used, and no external point relative to this universe is designated” (p. 82). Rae and Drury (1993), in an analysis of the way the phrase ‘the economy’ is used in newspapers, point out that </span>there is an implied national frame and an implies ‘we’: <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the </span></em>economy is ‘our’ economy.

<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Guardian began its report of John Major’s European piece of flagwaving with the words: “The Prime Minister slipped into Bristol unannounced yesterday to give the first big speech of the Tories’ European election campaign” (24 May 1994). The sentence rhetorically sets the scene for the main story to follow. </span>The very first word, which rhetorically draws no attention to itself, sets a scene for the scene-setting. It slips into the sentence unannounced: <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The </span></em>Prime Minister<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is not any prime minister: </span>it is <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the </span></em>prime minister of ‘our country’ (<em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the </span></em>country).<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> However, the phrase of ‘our country’ is omitted; it is unnecessary. </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The definite article accomplishes the deixis, indicating Britain as the centre of reader’s and writer’s (‘our’) shared universe.</span></span></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">  </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This form of deixis, in flagging the homeland, helps to make the homeland homely</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Utterances are not merely produced by contexts, but they also renew those contracts (Heritage, 1984; Linell, 1990; Nofsinger, 1991). For example the ‘home’ is more than a mere physical place. To use the well-known proverb, a house is not a home. Particular forms of conduct and discourse are necessary to translate the house into the home, making it ‘homey’ and marking it as a place for homely living (Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton, 1981; Dittmar, 1992). Because the members of the home speak in a relaxed, ‘homely’ way, when at home, the home is renewed as the homely place: being ‘at home’, thus, is a way of home-making.  </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is the same for talk within the homeland. One might describe the deictic use of the definite article as ‘homeland-making’, for it is the equivalant of a homely, home-making way of speaking. Consider the utterance ‘it’s in the kitchen’, spoken within a house by one member of the household to another. The speaker might know that, within the neighbourhood, there are hundreds of other kitchens. There is only one kitchen – <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the </span></em>kitchen – in this context. The universe has shrunken the boundaries of the home; here, other kitchens have to be marked, specifically indicated as ‘other’: ‘my brother’s kitchen’ or ‘the kitchen on the cover of the magazine’ are not ‘<em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the </span></em>kitchen’, (or ‘the living-room’ or ‘the stairs’) not only assumes the boundary of the home as the context of the utterance, but it also helps to renew this homely context. The phrase ‘the prime minister’ operates similarly.  </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is a parallel between the language of home and homeland. The French philosopher Gaston Bachelard, in his <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Politics of Space</span></em>, suggested that our childhood home is ‘our first universe, a real cosmos in every sense of the word.” Thereafter, all inhabited space “bears the essence of the notion of home” (1969, pp. 4-5). </span>The <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">national space most notably bears this trace</span>, being imagined as homely space, cosy within its borders, secure against the dangerous outside world. And ‘we’ the nation within the homeland can so easily imagine ‘ourselves’ as some sort of family<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If the national home is to be homely, then ‘we’ must make it so. ‘We’ cannot do this by constant, conscious endeavor. To be at home, ‘we’ must routinely and unconsciously use the homeland-making language. ‘</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">We’ must daily inhabit the environment of this language. Small, unnoticed words of deixis are important</span> in this respect. They help to shut the national door on the outside world. ‘The’ shuts the door more tightly than<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ‘this.’ Just as ‘we’ implies ‘them’, so ‘this country’ implies a contrastive ‘those countries’. When Major was claiming that ‘this’ was still the best country in the world, we was comparing ‘this’ with those foreign countries in which he could not bear to pass a weekend. Blair’s ‘this country’ was being mentioned in relation to the rest of Europe from which it might be isolated or left behind. Bush and Clinton, in ‘this, the world’s greatest counry’, were implicitly evoking a comparison with all those lesser countries. </span>But <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the </span></em>nation – with <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the </span></em>president or <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the </span></em>economy or, even, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the </span></em>weather – makes no such comparison<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What is ‘ours’ is presented as if it were the objective world; </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the </span></span></em><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is so concrete, so objective, so uncontroversial</span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In all these respects </span>the phrasing differs from the patriotic waving of the flag. The homeland is made both present and unnoticeable by being presented as <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the </span></em>context. When the homeland-making phrases are used with regularity, ‘we’ are unmindfully reminded who ‘we’ are and where ‘we’ are. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">‘We’ are identified without even being mentioned</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In this way</span>, <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">national identity is a routine way of talking and listening; it is a form of life, which habitually closes the front door, and seals the borders</span>. </span></strong> </span><br />

Without constant observation of the world of other nation, nationalists would be unable to claim that their nations meet the universal codes of nationhood</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Nor would they have ready access to stereotyped judgments about foreigners. Even the most extreme and unbanal of nationalists do not shut out the outside world from consciousness, but often show an obsessive concern with the lives and outlooks of foreigners. Hitler’s <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Table-Talk </span></em>is filled with speculations about the characters of different nations. One illustrative example, taken from 1942, can be given. Martin Bormann had apparently lent his Fuhrer a book entitled <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Juan in America</span></em>, itself an indicative action. Hitler opines lengthily, while his admirers listen:  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The British swallow everything they are told … [Americans] have the brains of a hen … the German Reich has two hundred and seventy opera houses – a standard of cultural existence of which they have no conception … Spaniards and Americans simply cannot understand each other … the Americans live like sows. (1988, pp. 604-5) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">And so on. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Hitler speaks a continuing stream of stereotypes, as he surveys the rest of the world</span> from his camp at Rastenburg.</u>  <br />
<u>Social psychologists frequently assume that narrow, bigoted thinking is characterized by the use of stereotypes. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">If the imagining of foreignness is an integral part of the theoretical consciousness of nationalism, then <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">foreignness is not an undifferentiated sense of ‘Otherness’</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (McDonald, 1993). Obsessively </span><u>fine distinctions can be made between different grounds of foreigners</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Indeed, </span><u>debates and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">controversies can arise about how similar or how different various groups of foreigners are to ‘us.</span>’ In</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> one of the earliest studies of stereotyping, Katz and Braly (1935) showed the extend to which white, American college students used conventional labels to characterize different ethnic and national groups: </span><u>Jews were mercenary, Turks were cruel, Germans efficient</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, etc. Later studies have indicated a decline in respondents’ willingness to use such generalizing stereotypes (Gilbert, 1951; Karlins et al., 1969). The stereotypes of other nations tend not to be uniformly scornful. Some foreigners are presumed to be more meritorious than others. Thus, Katz and Brly found that some foreign national types, such as the Germans, were praised in ways which others, especially non-European nations, were not.  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Stereotypes are shared, cultural descriptions of social groups. Even respondents, who might themselves claim to be skeptical about the truths of the stereotypes, recognize a culturally shared scale of valuations (Devine, 1989). Some foreigners are identified as being stereotyped as more admirable, and more like ‘us’ than others. (Hagendoorn, 1993a; Hagendoorn and Hraba, 1987; Hagendoorn and Kleinpenning, 1991). Inglehart (1991), examining the national attitudes of members of European nations, found that, with the exception of Italians, members of all nations rated their own nation as the must trustworthy. However, not all foreigners were rated equally untrustworthy. Members of small, non-Mediterranean European nations, such as Danes, Swiss and Dutch, tended to be rated more trustworthy, even by Mediterranean respondents. In short, it is commonplace that stereotyped distinctions are made between different sorts of foreigners. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Public opinion polls suggest that </span><u>there is nothing static in the stereotyped judgements</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Foreign stocks can rise and fall, in accord with the movements of political crises. The favourable stereotypes of Germans, which Katz and Braly (1935) found, declined as the United States prepared to enter the Second World War (Harding et al., 954). Most dramatic was the change in American judgments of the Russians, who, in 1945, switched from being heroic allies to bitterest rivals (Yatani and Bramel, 1989). With the collapse of Soviet communism, the American public has been presented with new enemies – whether Libyans, Iraqis or Arabs in general. With prolonged conflicts, a ‘siege mentality’ can develop, in which stereotypes become rigid, and the enemy is demonized with regular ferocity (Bar-Tal, 1989, 1990; Silverstein and Flamenbaum, 1989(. Sudden crises can produce quickly sharpened stereotypes, as, for eample, the emergency of ‘the ARgie’ in the British media during the Falklands War (Harris, 1985). The </span><u>quickly summoned stereotype will build upon older cultural myths,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> although there might be some initial uncertainty how these should be combined. One member of the British war cabinet was reported as wondering whether the Argentinians would actually go to war, given their half-Italian and half-Spanish ancestry. “There’s no precedent”, he said, because “if the Spanish half is uppermost, they’ll fight, if the Italian, they won’t” (quoted in Young, 1993, p. 278).  </span><br />
<u>Stereotypes are often means of distinguishing ‘them’ from ‘us’, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">thereby contributing to ‘our’ claims of a unique identity</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the eighteenth century, Britain developed many of its modern symbols of nationhood in conscious contradictions to French styles of nation-making (Cannadine, 1983; Colley, 1992). English writers debated whether there should be an English Academy, but the idea was rejected as being too French (Haugen, 1966a). The first recorded cartoon, depicting John Bull as an ‘Englishman’, also shows a Frenchman, as thin and meager as Bull is fat and generous (Surel, 1989). In this case, </span><u>the iconographic stereotype of ‘<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">us’ was created in contrastive differentiation from</span> the stereotype of ‘<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">them’</span>. The point is not merely a historical one, but there is an implicit contrast in the stereotyped judgment of ‘them’</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (McCauly et al., 1980; Stangor and Ford, 1992). Typically, </span><u>people ascribe more stereotypic traits to outgroups than to ingroups</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; ‘</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">we’</span> often <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">assume</span> ‘<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">ourselves’ as the standard</span>, or the unmarked normality, against which ‘their’ deviations appear notable</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Quattrone, 1986). If ‘they, the French’ are stereotyped as ‘emotional’, it is with implicit reference to ‘our’ presumed, non-emotional standards. Or conversely another group might be stereotyped as ‘cold’, whereas ‘we’ will be neither ‘cold’ (too cold) nor ‘emotional’ (too emotional).  </span><br />
<u>There is always the possibility of projection, as Kristeva realized in her descriptions of ‘foreignness’.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ‘We’ can claim that ‘</span><u>they’ possess the qualities, which ‘we’ deny in ‘ourselves’. In Western democracies, ‘our’ tolerance is much praised by ‘ourselves’. Journalists and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">politicians</span>, especially when arguing for immigration restrictions, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">cite ‘our’ tolerance, and ‘their’ intolerance, as a reason for excluding</span> ‘them’, the foreigners</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Barker, 1981; Van Dijk, 1991, 1992, 1993). The rhetoric denies ‘our’ prejudice and in </span><u>condenses an argumentative structure, which attributes intolerance to ‘them’; ‘our’ tolerance is threatened by ‘their’ presence; ‘they’ are either intolerant or cause intolerance; thus, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">‘<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">we’ seek to exclude ‘them’</span></strong>, not because ‘we’ are intolerant but,</span> quite the reverse, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">because ‘we’ are tolerant</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Billig, 1991; Wetherell and Potter, 1992).

Current War on Terror discourse constructs the “terrorist monster queer” as subhuman to be corrected for flaws in psyche, implicitly creating the normal citizen <br />
<span class="underline"><strong>Puar and Rai, 2.</strong> Jasbir K. </span><span class="tagChar"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">and</span></u></span><span class="underline"> Amit S. associate</span><span class="tagChar"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;"> professor of women's and gender studies at Rutgers University; Associate Professor of English at Florida State University, 2002 (“Monster, Terrorist, Fag: The War on Terrorism and the Production of Docile Patriots” <em>Social Text</em> 72, Vol. 20, No. 3, Fall) </span></u></span><br />
According to Foucault, the monster can be both half an animal and a hybrid gender (later in this text Foucault will go on to position the onanist as the third of the abnormals). But crucially <span class="underline">the monster is</span> also to be <span class="underline">differentiated from the individual to be corrected on the basis of whether power operates on it or through it</span>. In other words, <span class="underline">the absolute power that produces and quarantines the monster finds its dispersal in techniques of normalization and discipline</span>. What Foucault does, we believe, is enable an analysis of monstrosity within a broader history of sexuality. This <span class="underline">genealogy is crucial to understanding the</span> historical and political <span class="underline">relays</span>, reinvestments, and resistances <span class="underline">between the monstrous terrorist and the discourse of heteronormativity</span>. And that is <span class="underline">because monsters and abnormals have always also been sexual deviants</span>. Foucault tied monstrosity to sexuality through specific analyses of the deployment of gendered bodies, the regulation of proper desires, the manipulation of domestic spaces, and the taxonomy of sexual acts such as sodomy. As such, the sexualized monster was that figure that called forth a form of juridical power but one that was tied to multiform apparatuses of discipline as well.8 We <span class="underline">use</span> Foucault’s concept of <span class="underline">monstrosity</span> to <span class="underline">elaborate what we consider to be central to the present war on terrorism: </span>monstrosity as <span class="underline">a regulatory construct of modernity that imbricates not only sexuality, but also questions of culture and race</span>. Before we tie these practices to contemporary politics, let us note two things: First, the monster is not merely an other; it is one category through which a multiform power operates. As such, discourses that would mobilize monstrosity as a screen for otherness are always also involved in circuits of normalizing power as well: the monster and the person to be corrected are close cousins. Second, if the monster is part of the West’s family of abnormals, questions of race and sexuality will have always haunted its figuration. <span class="underline">The category of monstrosity is also an implicit index of civilizational development and cultural adaptability</span>. <span class="underline">As the machines of war begin to narrow the choices and life chances people have here in America and in decidedly more bloody ways abroad, it seems a certain grid of civilizational progress organized by such keywords as “democracy,” “freedom,” and “humanity” have come to superintend the figure of the monster</span>. We turn now to this double deployment of the discourse of monstrosity in “terrorism studies.” Today, we find the two figures of the monster and the person to be corrected in some ways converging in the discourse of the terrorist-monster. Which is to say that <span class="underline">the terrorist has become both a monster to be quarantined and an individual to be corrected</span>. It is in the strategic analyses of terrorism that these two figures come together. For the past thirty years, since 1968, the Western academy has been involved in the production and implementation of a body of knowledge that took the psyche of the terrorist as its object and target: “terrorism studies.” The strategic analysis of what in the intelligence community is known as “violent substate activism” is at the moment a highly sought-after form of knowledge production. And it has direct policy relevance; hence its uneven integration into the broader field of what Edward Said once named as the disciplinary home of Orientalism: “policy studies.”9 Our own analysis has been usefully informed by the pioneering work of scholars and activists such as Said, Cynthia Enloe, Ann Tickner, Noam Chomsky, Shirin M. Rai, Edward Herman, Helen Caldicott, Philip Agee, Talal Asad, and others.10 <span class="underline">These</span> writers <span class="underline">have opened a space of critique that brings the epistemological and ethical claims of terrorism studies to crisis; their rigorous and impassioned interrogation of U.S. foreign policy has not only enabled subsequent writers to make connections to ongoing domestic wars against people of color and the working poor but</span> crucially, their critiques have <span class="underline">enabled the countermemory of other genealogies, histories, and modes of power</span>: for example, <span class="underline">sexuality, colonialism, and normalization</span>. So, for instance, in the discourse of counterterrorism the shared modernity of the monster and the delinquent comes together in the knowledge of cultures, nations, and races. As one editorial in the magazine Foreign Policy put it, “The Global Positioning System, unmanned drones, unrivaled databases, and handheld computers—much has been made of the technological resources available to the U.S. military and diplomatic establishments. But what do you do if you’re trying to wage war in or against a country where you don’t know the locals, can’t speak the language, and can’t find any reliable maps? Welcome to the front lines of the war against terrorism, likely to be waged primarily in ‘swamp states’ about which the United States knows little.”11 The writer ends the piece by drawing a particular lesson from Sun Tzu’s The Art of War: “ ‘If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.’ If any war on terrorism is to succeed, the United States has some serious learning to do.” Terrorism studies is at the forefront of this knowledge production. In an article in the Rand Corporation–funded journal, Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, Richard Falkenrath notes: The literature on terrorism is vast. Most of this work focuses on the practitioners of terrorism, that is, on the terrorists themselves. Different strands within terrorism studies consider, for example, the motivations or belief systems of individual terrorists; the external strategies or . . . internal dynamics of particular terrorist organizations; or the interaction of terrorist movements with other entities, such as governments, the media, or social subgroups. . . . Terrorism studies aspires not just to scholastic respectability but to policy relevance. . . . It has helped organize and inform governmental counter-terrorism practices.12 <span class="underline">Counterterrorism is a form of racial, civilizational knowledge, but now also an academic discipline that is quite explicitly tied to the exercise of state power</span>. <span class="underline">This knowledge</span>, moreover, <span class="underline">takes the psyche as its privileged site of investigation</span>. As another article in Studies in Conflict and Terrorism put it, Models based on psychological concerns typically hold that ‘terrorist’ violence is not so much a political instrument as an end in itself; it is not contingent on rational agency but is the result of compulsion or psychopathology. Over the years scholars of this persuasion have suggested that ‘terrorists’ do what they do because of (variously and among other things) self-destructive urges, fantasies of cleanliness, disturbed emotions combined with problems with authority and the Self, and inconsistent mothering. Articulate attempts at presenting wider, vaguer, and (purportedly) generalizable psychological interpretations of terrorism have been made by, among others, Jerrold M. Post, who has proposed that “ . . . political terrorists are driven to commit acts of violence as a consequence of psychological forces, and . . . their special psychologic is constructed to rationalize acts they are psychologically compelled to commit.”13 We should note how white mythologies such as “inconsistent mothering” (and hence the bad family structure apparently common in the East) are presented as psychological compulsions that effectively determine and fix the mind of the terrorist. In this way, psychologists working within terrorism studies have been able to determine and taxonomize the terrorist mind. In a recent article in the journal Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, Charles L. Ruby has noted that there are two dominant frameworks in the interpretation of the terrorist “mindset”: “The first camp includes theories that portray terrorism as the result of defects or disorders in one’s personality structure. This first group of theories uses a broadly psychodynamic model. The second camp consists of theories that approach the phenomenon of terrorist behavior as a form of political violence perpetrated by people who do not have sufficient military resources to carry out conventional forms of political violence.”14 The personality defect model of terrorism holds that terrorists have fundamental and pathological defects in “their personality structure, usually related to a damaged sense of self.” Moreover, these defects result from “unconscious forces in the terrorist’s psyche.” And, of course, the psyche is the site of a familiar family romance: “Terrorism is a reflection of unconscious feelings of hostility toward parents and . . . this feeling is an outgrowth of childhood abuse or adolescent rebellion. The terrorist’s hostile focus is so great during childhood and adolescence that it continues into adulthood and becomes very narrow and extreme, ostensibly explaining the terrorist’s absolutist mindset and dedication.”As a leading light in the constellation of “terrorism experts,” Jerrold Post has proposed that terrorists suffer from pathological personalities that emerge from negative childhood experiences and a damaged sense of self.15 Post argues for two terrorist personality types, depending on the specific quality of those childhood experiences. First, Post suggests, there is the “anarchic-ideologue.” This is the terrorist who has experienced serious family dysfunction and maladjustment, which lead to rebellion against parents, especially against the father. Anarchic-ideologues fight “against the society of their parents . . . an act of dissent against parents loyal to the regime.” Second, there is the terrorist personality type known as the “nationalist-secessionist”— apparently the name indicates “a sense of loyalty to authority and rebellion against external enemies.” During childhood, a terrorist of this personality type experienced a sense of compassion or loyalty toward his or her parents. According to Post, nationalistsecessionists have pathologically failed to differentiate between themselves and the other (parental object). Consequently, they rebel “against society for the hurt done to their parents . . . an act of loyalty to parents damaged by the regime.” Both the anarchic-ideologue and nationalist-secessionist find “comfort in joining a terrorist group of rebels with similar experiences.” 16 The personality defect model views terrorists as suffering from personality defects that result from excessively negative childhood experiences, giving the individual a poor sense of self and a resentment of authority. As Ruby notes, “Its supporters differ in whether they propose one (Kaplan), two (Post and Jones &amp; Fong), or three (Strentz) personality types.”17 <span class="underline">What all these models and theories aim to show is how an otherwise normal individual becomes a murderous terrorist, and that process time and again is tied to the failure of the normal(ized) psyche</span>. Indeed, <span class="underline">an implicit but foundational supposition structures this entire discourse: the very notion of the normal psyche, which is</span> in fact part of <span class="underline">the West’s own heterosexual family romance</span>—a narrative space that relies on the normalized, even if perverse, domestic space of desire supposedly common in the West. <span class="underline">Terrorism</span>, in this discourse, <span class="underline">is a symptom of the deviant psyche, the psyche gone awry, or the failed psyche; the terrorist enters this discourse as an absolute violation</span>. So when Billy Collins (the 2001 poet laureate) asserted on National Public Radio immediately after September 11: “Now the U.S. has lost its virginity,” he was underscoring this fraught relationship between (hetero)sexuality, normality, the nation, and the violations of terrorism. Not surprisingly, then, coming out of this discourse, we find that <span class="underline">another very common way of trying to psychologize the monster-terrorist is by positing a kind of failed heterosexuality</span>. So we hear often the idea that sexually frustrated Muslim men are promised the heavenly reward of sixty, sixty-seven, or sometimes even seventy virgins if they are martyred in jihad. But As‘ad Abu Khalil has argued, “In reality, political—not sexual— frustration constitutes the most important factor in motivating young men, or women, to engage in suicidal violence. The tendency to dwell on the sexual motives of the suicide bombers belittles these sociopolitical causes.”18 Now of course, that is precisely what terrorism studies intends to do: to reduce complex social, historical, and political dynamics to various psychic causes rooted in childhood family dynamics. <span class="underline">As if the</span> Palestinian Intifada or the long, brutal <span class="underline">war in Afghanistan can be simply boiled down to bad mothering or sexual frustration</span>! In short, <span class="underline">these explanatory models and frameworks function to (1) reduce complex histories of struggle, intervention, and (non)development to Western psychic models rooted in the bourgeois heterosexual family and its dynamics</span>; (2) <span class="underline">systematically exclude questions of political economy and the problems of cultural translation; and</span> (3) <span class="underline">attempt to master the fear, anxiety, and uncertainty of a form of political dissent by resorting to the banality of a taxonomy</span>.19 Our contention is that today the knowledge and form of power that is mobilized to analyze, taxonomize, psychologize, and defeat terrorism has a genealogical connection to the West’s abnormals, and specifically those premodern monsters that Western civilization had seemed to bury and lay to rest long ago. The monsters that haunt the prose of contemporary counterterrorism emerge out of figures in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that have always been racialized, classed, and sexualized. The undesirable, the vagrant, the Gypsy, the savage, the Hottentot Venus, or the sexual depravity of the Oriental torrid zone shares a basic kinship with the terrorist-monster. As we know, in the twentieth century these disparate monsters became case studies, objects of ethnographies, and interesting psychological cases of degeneracy. The same Western, colonial modernity that created the psyche created the racial and sexual monster. In other words, what links the monster-terrorist to the figure of the individual to be corrected is first and foremost the racialized and deviant psyche. Isn’t that why there is something terrifyingly uncanny in the terrorist-monster? As one specifically liberal article in the Rand journal put it, “Members of such groups are not infrequently prepared to kill and die for their struggles and, as sociologists would attest, that presupposes a sort of conviction and mindset that has become uncommon in the modern age. Thus, not only the acts of ‘terrorism’ but also the driving forces behind them often appear incomprehensible and frightening to outsiders. Terrorism studies emerged as a subcategory within the social sciences in the early 1970s seeking to explain the resurgence of the seemingly inexplicable.” 20 It is <span class="underline">the figure of the inexplicable</span> that <span class="underline">continues to haunt all the civilizational grids that the Western war machine would deploy in its attempt to “understand the terrorist psyche</span>.” We now turn to consider more explicitly the relationship between this will to knowledge and the practices and rituals of heteronormativity. <br />

AND, Squo solutions to this “queer problem” is assimilationism – join the military, marry, be a normal, heterosexual, white, male citizen. This buys into a cult of sameness that forces queers to lose their difference. <br />
<span class="underline"><strong>Richardson, 5.</strong> Diane</span><span class="tagChar"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">, Professor of Sociology &amp; Social Policy at Newcastle University, 2005 (“</span></u></span>Desiring Sameness? The Rise of a Neoliberal Politics of Normalisation,” <em>Antipode</em>, 37:3, June) <br />
Since the 1990s, a new form of sexual politics has emerged that has been highly influential in redefining the political goals and strategies associated with lesbian and gay activism. This is a politics that by invoking—and simultaneously constituting—a ‘‘gay movement’’ that seeks incorporation into the mainstream, rejects the earlier political language of women’s, lesbian and gay liberation in favour of a ‘‘lesbian and gay equality’’ rhetoric. Before discussing this shift in more detail, it is important to clarify the frameworks of ‘‘equality’’ that these demands are based upon. One of the most common interpretations of equality in contemporary neoliberal societies such as the USA and Britain is equality of resources and recognition. Furthermore, what is implicit in such models is an emphasis on shared characteristics, the supposition that ‘‘equality’’ requires ‘‘sameness’’ (Cooper 2004). Although there are conflicts over the use of the term ‘‘equality’’, this is also the dominant model deployed by contemporary lesbian and gay rights movements. The case being made is for equality with the dominant group (heterosexuals) for a particular social membership (lesbians, bisexuals and gay men), where the subject of equality is interpreted as equal entitlement to recognition and to resources, centred upon demands for civil rights, access to welfare and rights as consumers (Vaid 1995; Warner 1999). More specifically, it is struggles over the civil recognition of domestic partnerships, including the right to marry, and the right to serve in the military that have emerged as primary concerns of lesbian and gay movements in Europe and the USA (Cooper 2004; Phelan 2001; Richardson 2000a). A common justification of these and other demands for social inclusion—one that is made both by lesbian and gay movements themselves and neoliberal governments responsive to their rights claims—is that lesbians and gay men are ‘‘ordinary’’, ‘‘normal’’ citizens. This is exemplified in the arguments developed by neoconservative gay writers such as Bawer, who asserts that the ‘‘lifestyle’’ of mainstream gays is ‘‘indistinguishable from that of most heterosexual couples in similar professional and economic circumstances’’ (1993:33–34). Sullivan (1995) advances a similar argument, claiming that the majority of lesbian and gay individuals have the same values, aspirations and lifestyles as most heterosexuals and desire nothing more than to be fully integrated into society as it is. These assumptions are problematic for a variety of reasons. First, the emphasis on sameness implies that lesbians and gay men, as well as heterosexuals, have shared interests and needs. In effect, sameness emerges from difference through two mechanisms: first through the appeal to a universal lesbian and gay citizen who deserves equal rights with heterosexuals; and second, through the dominant interpretation of equality as similitude, in this case between lesbians, gay men and heterosexuals. To the extent that lesbian and gay communities are socially heterogeneous, an obvious problem with this approach is that differences and the complex social locations within that group membership are obscured and inequalities such as those of gender, class, race and disability are not addressed. Given the difficulties associated with the construction of sameness, I have chosen to use lesbian/gay rather than ‘‘lesbian and gay’’ as a way of acknowledging the significance of gender differences. Second, the emphasis on shared norms and inclusivity raises difficulties in relation to what constructions of lesbians and gay men are mobilised in order to establish the case for equality. Related to this is the question of what counts as ‘‘equal’’ recognition; what are the values and norms through which recognition of lesbians and gay men as the ‘‘same’’ as heterosexuals, as well as with each other, takes place. Critics have questioned the extent to which such a model of citizenship reinforces normative assumptions about sexuality and gender (Bell and Binnie 2000; Duggan 1995; Richardson 2000b; Warner 1999). The problem identified here is that a particular version of what it is to be lesbian or gay (as well as heterosexual) is privileged in demands for ‘‘equality’’, with the potential for creating ‘‘new social, economic and moral divisions between lesbians and gay men, between heterosexuals and across the heterosexual/homosexual divide’’ (Richardson 2004:405). As I go on to suggest below, the question of how the lesbian/gay ‘‘community’’ is represented by political organisations concerned with sexual politics is also connected to the increasing professionalisation of those organisations. In particular, we need to consider how the construction of a specific normative lesbian/gay citizenship may impact on the way political organisations are staffed and the styles of leadership they may favour. <br />

<em>Puar goes even further by suggesting that the very idea of transgression is inseparable from the exceptionalist discourse.[50] The queer project, according to this, is complicit, even if unwittingly, with Western supremacy. It is indeed noteworthy that ‘queer’ and other alternative practices such as sadomasochism, swinging and even some types of (non-migrant) sex work have become mainstreamed on an unprecedented scale. In the British context, this can be illustrated with the expansion of sex shops and department stores such as Ann Summers and Harmony, the proliferation of sex-advice reality shows on Channel 4 (e.g. Sex Inspectors, in early 2007) and Channel 5 (e.g. How to Have Sex After Marriage, in late 2007), and the inclusion of queer columns in the free newspapers London Paper and Metro (‘Gay About Town’, ‘Gay Girl About Town’, and ‘Harsh Words’ by drag queen Jodie Harsh). It is further reflected in the expansion of on- and offline spaces for practitioners of BDSM (bondage &amp; discipline, domination &amp; submission, sadism &amp; masochism) and other ‘alternative’ sexual practices such as swinging, an increasingly popular type of non-monogamous, often public sex. There has also been a noticeable trickling ‘up’ of kinky styles in fashion and popular culture. Examples include the embrace of fetish wear (corsets, boots, even whips) by stars such as Madonna or Rihanna, and the adoption of corsets and steel-heel knee-high leather boots as everyday items of female fashion.[51] Some of these developments can be explained by the capitalist need for expansion, and the need for variation and transgression in consumer culture.[52] However, even areas traditionally perceived as sex-negative are opening themselves up to sex-radical agendas. There has, for example, been a queering of feminist activism and scholarship, which needs to be contextualized with the history of feminist involvement in neo/colonial projects. One example was the Feminist Fightback conference at the School of Oriental and African Studies on 21 October 2006 in London. The conference organizers had invited several sex-radical, including sex worker rights’, interventions but ended on a highly race-conservative note when during the final plenary they called for the ‘liberation’ of veiled Muslim women. Sex worker rights’ activists are clearly working in a different temporality from gay rights’ activists. While homosexuality has been largely decriminalized, the criminalization of sex-work related practices is far from over, and on the increase even, including seeking commercial sex, or migrating or aiding migration for the purposes of selling sex.[53] Unlike homosexuality, sex work is still largely excluded from the ‘sexual freedom’ discourse, and is championed largely by individuals on the radical left who identify with multi-issue politics. Nevertheless, any reforms are likely to occur within a similar genealogy, and sex worker rights’ activists, like other sex radicals, will have to actively resist being enlisted into the exceptionalist discourse. Neither queer transgression nor sex worker rights, then, can be discussed outside the sexual exceptionalism which is at the basis of the ‘war on terror’. The new discourse on sexual rights v. religious rights ignores how gay citizenship has occurred centrally, and I have argued agentically, in a context of war and racist backlash. Populist calls for coalitions (with their tired tendency to stay single issue) and lazy arguments against or in favour of intersectionality no longer suffice in this context of exceptionalism. As the intersectionality approach is becoming mainstreamed in again mostly white circles,[54] standpoint politics, too, have failed to translate. Minoritized people have a clear place in exceptionalist politics, including queers and feminists racialized as Muslim, who are given voice only where they are willing to authenticate themselves by mimetically repeating racist notions of Islamic gender/sexuality regimes.[55] The gay participation in the ‘war on terror’ demonstrates the limits of an identity politics which seeks recognition by a system which is as imperialist as it is neoliberal. And still, it clearly matters which differences we are forced to carry in and on our bodies. The new interest in phenomenology,[56] which pays attention to both these differences and their constructedness in social encounters, is hopeful in this respect. How do we perceive injustice, against other bodies, and our own? The old truths of second-generation feminism remain relevant here, such as Audre Lorde’s call on dominant people to reach deep within our/themselves, to those painful places, like the asylum or the public toilet, which we/they would rather forget and leave behind.[57] How do we remain in traumatized bodies without forcing others into our corner in the family of monsters, without succumbing to either coercive mimeticism or to the violent assimilationism of a society which aggressively expels difference while claiming to love it? Finally, it is indeed important to look at the state. As Michel Foucault has long taught us, this must however be combined with a wider examination of governmentality. The gay participation in the ‘war on terror’ demonstrates the limits of an identity politics which seeks recognition by a system which is as imperialist as it is neoliberal. Consequently, the struggle against state violence must necessarily be combined with a struggle against hegemonic whiteness in gay and queer spaces themselves.</em><br />

<em>If a fantasy trajectory, utopian in its own terms, toward gay genocide has been endemic in Western culture from its origins, then, it may also have been true that the trajectory toward gay genocide was never clearly distinguishable from a broader, apocalyptic trajectory toward something approaching omnicide. The deadlock of the past century between minoritizing and universalizing understandings of homo/heterosexual definition can only have deepened this fatal bond in the heterosexist imaginaire. In our culture as in Billy Budd, the phobic narrative trajectory toward imagining a time after the homosexual is finally inseparable from that toward imagining a time after the homosexual; in the wake of the homosexual, the wake incessantly produced since first there were homosexuals, every human relation is pulled into its shining representational furrow. Fragments of visions of a time after the homosexual are, of course, currently in dizzying circulation in our culture. One of the many dangerous ways that AIDS discourse seems to ratify and amplify preinscribed homophobic mythologies is in its pseudo-evolutionary presentation of male homosexuality as a stage doomed to extinction (read, a phase the species is going through) on the enormous scale of whole populations. 26 The lineaments of openly genocidal malice behind this fantasy appear only occasionally in the respectable media, though they can be glimpsed even there behind the poker-face mask of our national experiment in laissez-faire medicine. A better, if still deodorized, whiff of that malice comes from the famous pronouncement of Pat Robertson: “AIDS is God’s way of weeding his garden.” The saccharine luster this dictum gives to its vision of devastation, and the ruthless prurience with which it misattributes its own agency, cover a more fundamental contradiction: that, to rationalize complacent glee at a spectacle of what is imagined as genocide, a proto-Darwinian process of natural selection is being invoked – in the context of a Christian fundamentalism that is not only antievolutionist but recklessly oriented toward universal apocalypse. A similar phenomenon, also too terrible to be noted as a mere irony, is how evenly our cultures phobia about HIV-positive blood is kept pace with by its rage for keeping that dangerous blood in broad, continuous circulation. This is evidenced in projects for universal testing, an in the needle-sharing implicit in William Buckley’s now ineradicable fantasy of tattooing HIV-positive persons. But most immediately and pervasively it is evidenced in literal bloodbaths that seem to make the point of the AIDS-related resurgence in violent bashings of gays – which, unlike the gun violence otherwise ubiquitous in this culture, are characteristically done with two-by-fours, baseball bats, and fists, in the most literal-minded conceivable form of body-fluid contact. It might be worth making explicit that the use of evolutionary thinking in the current wave of utopian/genocidal fantasy is, whatever else it may be, crazy. Unless one believes, first of all, that same-sex object-choice across history and across cultures is one thing with one cause, and, second, that its one cause is direct transmission through a nonrecessive genetic path – which would be, to put it gently, counter-intuitive – there is no warrant for imagining that gay populations, even of men, in the post-AIDS generations will be in the slightest degree diminished. Exactly to the degree that AIDS is a gay disease, it’s a tragedy confined to our generation; the long term demographic depredations of the disease will fall, to the contrary, on groups, many themselves direly endangered, that are reproduced by direct heterosexual transmission. Unlike genocide directed against Jews, Native Americans, Africans, or other groups, then, gay genocide, the once-and-for-all eradication of gay populations, however potent and sustained as a project or fantasy of modern Western culture, is not possible short of the eradication of the whole human species. The impulse of the species toward its own eradication must not either, however, be underestimated. Neither must the profundity with which that omnicidal impulse is entangled with the modern problematic of the homosexual: the double bind of definition between the homosexual, say, as a distinct risk group, and the homosexual as a potential representation within the universal. 27 As gay community and the solidarity and visibility of gays as a minority population are being consolidated and tempered in the forge of this specularized terror and suffering, how can it fail to be all the more necessary that the avenues of recognition, desire, and thought between minority potentials and universalizing ones be opened and opened and opened?</em><br />

<em>Consider again the contrastive terms in which it is possible to view biopolitics and sovereignty. The final chapter in the first volume of the</em> History of Sexuality <em>that contrasts sovereignty and biopolitics is titled “Right of Death and Power over Life.” The initial terms of the contrast between the two registers of government is thus between one that could employ power to put subjects to death, even if this right to kill was conditioned by the defense of the sovereign, and one that was concerned with the fostering of life. Nevertheless, each part of the contrast can be further broken down. The right of death can also be understood as “the right to take life or let live”; the power over life as the power “to foster life or disallow it. Sovereign power is a power that distinguishes between political life (bios) and mere existence or bare life (zoe). Bare life is included in the constitution of sovereign power by its very exclusion from political life. In contrast, biopolitics might be thought to include zoe in bios: stripped down mere existence becomes a matter of political reality. Thus, the contrast between biopolitics and sovereignty is not one of a power of life versus a power of death but concerns the way that different forms of power treat matters of life and death and entail different conceptions of life. Thus, biopolitics reinscribes the earlier right of death and power over life and places it within a new and different form that attempts to include what had earlier been sacred and taboo, bare life, in political existence. It is no longer so much the right of the sovereign to put to death his enemies but to disqualify the life—the mere existence—of those who are a threat to the life of the population, to disallow those deemed “unworthy of life,” those whose bare life is not worth living. This allows us, first, to consider what might be thought of as the dark side of biopolitics (Foucault 1979a: 136-37). In Foucault’s account, biopolitics does not put an end to the practice of war: it provides war with new and more sophisticated killing machines. These machines allow killing itself to be reposed at the level of entire populations. Wars become genocidal in the twentieth century. The same state that takes on the duty to enhance the life of the population also exercises the power of death over whole populations. Atomic weapons are the key weapons of this process of power to put the whole populations to death. We might also consider here the aptly named biological and chemical weapons that seek an extermination of populations by visiting plagues upon them or polluting the biosphere in which they live to the point at which bare life is no longer sustainable. Nor does the birth of biopolitics put an end to the killing of one’s own populations. Rather, it intensifies that killing—whether by an “ethnic cleansing” that visits holocausts upon whole groups or by the mass slaughters of classes and groups conducted in the name of the utopia to be achieved. There is a certain restraint in sovereign power. The right of death is only occasionally exercised as the right to kill and then often in a ritual fashion that suggests a relation to the sacred. More often, sovereign power is manifest in the</em> refraining <em>from the right to kill. The biopolitical imperative knows know such restraint. Power is exercised at the level of populations and hence wars will be waged at that level, on behalf of everyone and their lives. This point brings us to the heart of Foucault’s provocative thesis about biopolitics: that there is an intimate connection between the exercise of a life-administering power and the commission of genocide: “If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill: it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large scale phenomenon of the population” (1979: 137). Foucault completes this same passage with an expression that deserves more notice: “massacres have become vital.” There is thus a kind of perverse homogeneity between the power over life and the power to take life characteristic of biopower. The emergence of a biopolitical racism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries can be approached as a trajectory in which this homogeneity always threatened to top over into a dreadful necessity. This racism can be approached as a fundamental mechanism of power that is inscribed in the biopolitical domain (Stoler 1995: 84-85). For Foucault, The notion and techniques of population had given rise, at the end of the nineteenth century, to a new linkage among population, the internal organization of states, and the competition between states. Darwinism, as an imperial social program, would plot the ranking of individuals, populations, and nations along the common gradient of</em> fitness <em>and thus measure</em> efficiency<em>. However, the series “population, evolution, and race” is not simply a way of thinking about the superiority of the “white races” or of justifying colonialism, but also of thinking about how to treat the degenerates and abnormals in one’s own population and prevent further degeneration of the race. The second and most important function for Foucault of this biopolitical racism in the nineteenth century is that “it establishes a positive relation between the right to kill and the assurance of life” (Stoler 1995: 84). The life of the population, its vigor, its health, its capacities to survive becomes necessarily linked to the elimination of internal and external threats. This power to disallow life is perhaps best encapsulated in the injunction of the eugenic project: to identify those who are degenerate, abnormal, feeble-minded, or of an inferior race and subject them to force sterilization; encourage those who are superior, fit, intelligent to propagate. Identify those whose life is but mere existence and disqualify their propagation; encourage those who can partake of a sovereign existence and of a moral and political life. But this last example does not necessarily establish a positive justification for the right to kill, only the right to disallow life. If we are to begin to understand the type of racism engaged in by Nazism, however, we need to take into account another kind of denouement between the biopolitical management of population and the exercise of sovereignty. This version of sovereignty is no longer the transformed and democratized form founded on the liberty of the juridical subject, as it is for liberalism, but a sovereignty that takes up and transforms a further element of sovereignty, its “symbolics of blood” (Foucault 1979: 148). For Foucault, sovereignty is grounded in blood—as a reality and as a symbol—just as one might say that sexuality becomes the key field on which biopolitical management of populations is articulated. When power is exercised through repression and deduction, through a law over which hangs the sword, when it is exercised on the scaffold by the torturer and the executioner, and when relations between households and families were forged through alliance, “blood was</em> a reality with a symbolic function.<em>” By contrast, for biopolitics with its themes of health, vigorm fitness, vitality, progeny, survival, and race, “power spoke</em> of <em>sexuality</em> to <em>sexuality” (Foucault 1979a: 147). For Foucault (1979a: 149-50), the novelty of National Socialism was the way it articulated “the oneiric exaltation of blood,” of fatherland, and of the triumph of the race in an immensely cynical and naïve fashion, with the paroxysms of a disciplinary and biopolitical power concerned with the detailed administration  of the life of the population and the regulation of sexuality, family, marriage, and education. Nazism generalized biopower without the limit-critique posed by the juridical subject of right, but it could not do away with sovereignty. Instead, it established a set of permanent interventions into the conduct of the individual within the population and articulated this with the “mythical concern for blood and the triumph of the race.” Thus, the shepherd-flock game and the city-citizen game are transmuted into the eugenic ordering of biological existence (of mere living and subsistence) and articulated on the themes of the purity of blood and the myth of the fatherland.</em><br />
<em>In such an articulation of these elements of sovereign and biopolitical forms of power, the relation between the administration of life and the right to kill entire populations is no longer simply one of a dreadful homogeneity. It has become a necessary relation. The administration of life comes to require a bloodbath. It is not simply that power, and therefore war, will be exercised at the level of an entire population. It is that the act of disqualifying the right to life of other races becomes necessary for the fostering of the life of the race. Moreover, the elimination of other races is only once face of the purification of one’s own race (Foucault 1997b: 231). The other part is to expose the latter to a universal and absolute danger, to expose it to the risk of death and total destruction. For Foucault, with the Nazi state we have an “absolutely racist state, an absolutely murderous state and an absolutely suicidal state” (232), all of which are superimposed and converge on the Final Solution. With the Final Solution, the state tries to eliminate, through the Jews, all other races, for whom the Jews were the symbol and the manifestation. This includes, in one of Hitler’s last acts, the order to destroy the bases of bare life for the German people itself. “Final solution for other races, the absolute suicide of the German race” is inscribed, according to Foucault, in the functioning of the modern state (232).</em><br />

Perhaps <span class="underline">the fundamental attitude which defines the subject is</span> neither the passivity of an authentic experience nor autonomous, spontaneous activity, but precisely <span class="underline">interpassivity</span>. This interpassivity is to be opposed to the Hegelian List der Vernunft ('cunning of Reason'): in the case of the 'cunning of Reason', I am active through the other, i.e. <span class="underline">I can remain passive, while the Other does it for me</span> (like the Hegelian Idea which remains outside of the conflict, letting human passions do the work for it); in the case of interpassivity, I am passive through the other, i.e. I accede to the other the passive aspect (of enjoying), while I can remain actively engaged (I can continue to work in the evening, while the VCR passively enjoys for me; I can make financial arrangements for the deceased's fortune while the weepers mourn for me). This allows us to propose the notion of false activity: <span class="underline">you think you are active, while your true position,</span> as it is embodied in the fetish, <span class="underline">is passive </span>... Far from being an excessive phenomenon which occurs only in extreme 'pathological' situations, interpassivity, in its opposition to interactivity (not in the standard sense of interacting with the medium, but in the sense of another doing it for me, in my place), is perhaps the feature which defines the most elementary level, the necessary minimum, of subjectivity: in order to be an active subject, I have to get rid of - and transpose onto the other - the inert passivity which contains the density of my substantial being. Transposing onto another my very passive experience is a much more uncanny phenomenon than that of being active through another: in interpassivity, I am decentred in a much more radical way than in interactivity, since interpassivity deprives me of the very kernel of my substantial identity. The more I am active, the more I must be passive at another place, i.e. the more there must be another object which is passive in my place, on my behalf. (This axiom is realised in its utmost simplicity in the proverbial high manager who, from time to time, feels compelled to visit prostitutes to be exposed to masochist rituals and 'treated as a mere object'). So, in contrast to the commonplace according to which the new media turn us into passive consumers who just stare blindly at the screen, one should claim that the so-called threat of the new media resides in the fact that they deprive us of our passivity, of our authentic passive experience, and thus prepare us for mindless frenetic activity. The Politics of Disidentification In order to elaborate further on this gap which is constitutive of the symbolic order, let me take an example from cinema. <span class="underline">Contrary to the common misperception, Robert Altman's MASH is a perfectly conformist film</span> - <span class="underline">for all their mockery of authority</span>, practical jokes <span class="underline">and sexual escapades, the members of the MASH crew exemplarily perform their job, and thus present absolutely no threat to the smooth running of the military machine</span>. In other words, the cliche which regards MASH as an anti-militarist film, depicting the horrors of the meaningless military slaughter which can be endured only through a healthy measure of cynicism, practical jokes, laughing at the pompous official rituals, etc., misses the point - <span class="underline">this very distance is ideology</span>. This dimension of MASH becomes even more tangible the moment one compares it with another well-known film about military life, An Officer and a Gentleman. MASH and An Officer and a Gentleman exhibit the two versions of the perfectly functioning military subject: identification with the military machine is supported either by ironic distrust, indulgence in practical jokes and sexual escapades (MASH), or, by the awareness that behind the cruel drill-sergeant there is a 'warm human person', a helping father substitute who only feigns cruelty (in An Officer and a Gentleman), in strict homology to the - profoundly anti-feminist - myth of a hooker who, deep in her heart, longs to be a good mother. The lesson is thus clear: <span class="underline">an ideological identification exerts a true hold on us precisely when we maintain an awareness that we are not fully identical to it, that there is a rich human person beneath it: 'not all is ideology, beneath the ideological mask, I am also a human person', is the very form of ideology, of its 'practical efficiency'</span>. For that reason, <span class="underline">an ideological edifice can be undermined by a too literal identification: its successful functioning requires a minimum of distance from its explicit rules</span>. Is an exemplary case of such a subversion-through-identification not provided by Jaroslav Hasek's <span class="underline">The Good Soldier</span> Schwejk, the novel whose hero <span class="underline">wreaks total havoc by simply executing the orders of his superiors in an overzealous and all too literal way</span>? The inevitable conclusion to be drawn from this paradox is that the feature which effectively sustains identification, the famous Freudian-Lacanian einziger Zug, the unary feature, is not the obvious one, the big 'official' insignia, but a small feature, even the one of marking a distance from the official insignia. Let us recall the case of the 'leader caught with his pants down': <span class="underline">the solidarity of the group is strengthened by their common disavowal of the misfortune that laid open the Leader's failure or impotence - a shared lie is an incomparably more effective bond for a group than the truth</span>. When, in an academic department, members of the inner circle surrounding a famous professor become aware of some flaw of his (he is addicted to drugs, a kleptomaniac, a sexual masochist pervert, he has stolen a key line of argumentation from a student, etc.), this very knowledge of the flaw - coupled with the willingness to disavow this knowledge - is the true feature of identification which keeps the group together ... (The catch, of course, is that the subject fascinated by the charismatic figure of a Leader is necessarily the victim of a kind of perspective-illusion: he (mis)perceives the 'because of as 'in spite of: in his subjective experience, he adores the Leader in spite of the mark of his weakness, not because of it.) The Duelists, Ridley Scott's extraordinary directorial debut (based on a short story by Heinrich Kleist), depicts the life-long combat between two high-ranking soldiers, a true upper class nobleman and an aspiring officer of middle class origins - what keeps them forever apart, is the difference in the way that each of them relates to the upper class code of honour: the aspiring middle class officer doggedly follows this code, and, for that very reason, generates the lasting impression of awkward ridicule; his counterpart, the nobleman, constantly violates the explicit rules of the official code, and thereby asserts his true upper-classness. There is, however, another mode of distance towards the explicit ideological text not to be confused with this implicit disidentification. <span class="underline">When</span> the <span class="underline">Clinton</span> administration <span class="underline">resolved the deadlock of gays in the</span> US <span class="underline">Army with the compromise of 'Don't ask, don't tell!</span>' (i.e. soldiers are not directly asked if they are gay, so they are also not compelled to lie and deny it, although they are not formally allowed in the Army - they are tolerated insofar as they keep their sexual orientation private and do not actively endeavour to engage others in it), <span class="underline">this</span> opportunist measure <span class="underline">was</span> deservedly <span class="underline">criticized for</span> basically <span class="underline">endorsing the homophobic attitude towards homosexuality: although the direct prohibition of homosexuality is not to be enforced, its very existence as a virtual threat compelling gays to remain in the closet affects their actual social status</span>. <span class="underline">However</span>, most of the <span class="underline">critics failed to ask a</span> naive, but nonetheless <span class="underline">crucial question: why does the Army universe so strongly resist publicly accepting gays into its ranks? </span>There is only one consistent answer possible: <span class="underline">not because homosexuality poses a threat to the</span> alleged <span class="underline">'phallic and patriarchal' libidinal economy of the Army community, but</span>, on the contrary, <span class="underline">because the libidinal economy of the Army community itself relies on a</span> thwarted/<span class="underline">disavowed homosexuality as the key component of the soldiers' male bonding</span>. From my own experience, I remember how <span class="underline">the</span> old infamous Yugoslav People's <span class="underline">Army was homophobic to the extreme</span> (when someone was discovered to have homosexual inclinations, he was instantly turned into a pariah, treated as a non-person, before being formally dismissed from the Army), <span class="underline">yet, at the same time, everyday army life was excessively permeated with the atmosphere of homosexual innuendoes</span>. Say, while soldiers were standing in line for their meal, a common vulgar joke was to stick a finger into the arse of the person ahead of you and then to withdraw it quickly, so that when the surprised person turned around, he did not know who among the soldiers behind his back sharing a stupid obscene smile did it. A predominant form of greeting a fellow soldier in my unit, instead of simply saying 'Hello!', was to say 'Smoke my prick!' (Tusi kurac!' in Serbo-Croat); this formula was so standardized that it completely lost any obscene connotation and was pronounced in a totally neutral way, as a pure act of politeness. The key point not to be missed here is how <span class="underline">this fragile co-existence of extreme and violent homophobia with thwarted</span>, i.e. publicly non-acknowledged, <span class="underline">'underground' homosexual libidinal economy, bears witness to the fact that the discourse of the military community can only be operative by way of censoring its own libidinal foundation</span>. Outside the confines of military life, do we not encounter a strictly homologous self-censoring mechanism in the contemporary conservative populism with its sexist and racist bias? Suffice it to recall the election campaigns of Jesse Helms in which <span class="underline">the</span> racist and <span class="underline">sexist message is not publicly acknowledged</span> (at the public level, it is sometimes even violently disavowed), <span class="underline">but is instead articulated 'between the lines', in a series of double entendres and coded allusions</span>. The point is that <span class="underline">this kind of self-censorship</span> (not openly admitting one's own fundamental message) <span class="underline">is necessary if, in the present ideological conditions</span>, Helms's <span class="underline">discourse is to remain operative: if it were to articulate directly, in a public way, its</span> racist <span class="underline">bias, this would render it unacceptable in the eyes of the predominant regime of the political discourse; if it were to effectively abandon the self-censored coded</span> racist <span class="underline">message, it would endanger the support of its targeted electoral body</span>. The conservative populist political discourse thus offers an exemplary case of the power discourse whose efficiency depends on the mechanism of self-censorship: <span class="underline">it relies on a mechanism which is operative only insofar as it remains censored</span>. Against the image, allpresent in cultural criticism, of a radical subversive discourse or practice 'censored' by power, one is even tempted to claim that today, more than ever, <span class="underline">the mechanism of censorship intervenes predominantly to enhance the efficiency of the power discourse itself</span>. Let me emphasise here the distinction between the Foucauldian motif of the interconnection of power and resistance, and this notion of 'inherent transgression'. Foucault, in the Volume 1 of his History of Sexuality, asserts the immanence of resistance to power. However, <span class="underline">the point of 'inherent transgression' is not only that resistance is imminent to power, that power and counter-power generate each other</span>; it is not only that power itself generates the excess of resistance which it can no longer dominate; it is not only <span class="underline">that - in the case of sexuality - the disciplinary 'repression'</span> of a libidinal investment <span class="underline">eroticises this gesture</span> of repression <span class="underline">itself,</span> as in the case of the obsessional neurotic who gets libidinal satisfaction out of the very compulsive rituals destined to keep at bay the traumatic puissance. This last point must be further radicalised: <span class="underline">the power edifice itself is split from within; in order to reproduce itself and contain its Other, it has to rely on an inherent excess which grounds it</span>. It is thus not enough to assert, in a Foucauldian way, that power is inextricably linked to counter-power, generating it and being itself conditioned by it: the split is always already mirrored back into the power edifice itself, splitting it from within, so that the gesture of selfcensorship is co-substantial with the exercise of power. <br />

AND, Second is letter of the law. Don’t ask don’t tell banned queers from the military – tt is only when we take this law to its ugliest limits that we can expose the military’s homoeroticism. This is the only way to break free of our fantasy and ruin the law. <br />
<span class="underline"><strong>Zizek, 4.</strong> Slavoj</span><span class="tagChar"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;"> (</span></u></span>Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana<em>jh)<span class="tagChar"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">, 2004 </span></u></span></em><u>Revolution at the Gates<em>, pp. 147-50</em></u><br />
<em>Consequently, there are two ways of subverting the Law, the “masculine” and the “feminine.” One can violate/transgress its prohibitions: this is the inherent transgression which sustains the Law, like the advocates of liberal democracy who secretly (through the CIA) train murderers-terrorists for the proto-Fascist regimes in Latin America. That is false rightist heroism: secretly doing the “necessary but dirty thing,” that is, violating the explicit ruling ideology (of human Rights, and so on) in order to sustain the existing order. Much more subversive than this is simply to do what is allowed, that is, what the existing order explicitly allows, although it prohibits it at the level of implicit unwritten prohibitions. In short – to paraphrase Brecht’s well-known crack about how mild robbing a bank is in comparison with founding a bank – how mild transgressing the Law is in comparison with obeying it thoroughly – or, as Kierkegaard put it, in his unique way “We do not laud the son who said “No,” but we endeavour to learn from the gospel how dangerous it is to say, “Sir, I will.” What better example is there than Halek’s immortal “good soldier Shweik,” who caused total havoc in the old Imperial Austrian Army simply by obeying orders all too literally? (Although, strictly speaking, there is a better example, namely the “absolute example” [Hegel], Christ himself: when Christ claims that he is here merely to fulfill the [Jewish] Law, he thereby bears witness to how his act effectively cancels the Law.) The basic paradox of the relationship between public power and its inherent transgression is that the subject is actually “in” (caught in the web of) power only and precisely in so far as he does not fully identify with it but maintains a kind of distance towards it; on the other hand, the system (of public Law) is actually undermined by unreserved identification with it. Stephen King’s “Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption” tackles this problem with due stringency apropros of the paradoxes of prison life. The cliché about prison life is that I am actually integrated into it, ruined by it, when my accommodation to it is so overwhelming that I can no longer stand or even imagine freedom, life outside prison, so that my release brings about a total psychic breakdown, or at least gives rise to a longing for the lost safety of prison life. The actual dialectic of prison life, however, is somewhat more refined. Prison in effect destroys me, attains a total hold over me, precisely when I do not fully consent to the fact that I am in prison but maintain a kind of inner distance towards it, stick to the illusion that “real life is elsewhere” and indulge all the time in daydreaming about life outside, about nice things that are waiting for me after my release or escape. I thereby get caught in the vicious cycle of fantasy, so that when, eventually, I am released, the grotesque discord between fantasy and reality breaks me down. The only true solution is therefore fully to accept the rules of prison life and then, within the universe governed by these rules, to work out a way to beat them. In short, inner distance and daydreaming about Life Elsewhere in effect enchain me to prison, whereas full acceptance of the fact that I am really there, bound by prison rules, opens up a space for true hope. What this means is that in order effectively to liberate oneself from the grip of existing social reality, one should first renounce the transgressive fantasmatic supplement that attaches us to it. In what does this renunciation consist? In a series of recent (commercial) films, we find the same surprising radical gesture. In</em> Speed<em>, when the hero (Keanu Reeves) is confronting the terrorist blackmailer who is holding his partner at gunpoint, the hero shoots not the blackmailer, but his own partner in the leg – this apparently senseless act momentarily shocks the blackmailer, who releases the hostages and runs away… In</em> Ransom, <em>when the media tycoon (Mel Gibson_ goes on television to answer the kidnapers’ request for two million dollars as a ransom for his son, he surprises everyone by saying that he will offer two million dollars to anyone who will give him any information about the kidnappers, and announces that he will pursue them to the end, with all his resources, if they do not release his son immediately. This radical gesture not only stuns the kidnappers—immediately after acoomplishing it, Gibson himself almost breaks down, aware of the risk he is courting… And, finally, the supreme case: when, in the flashback scene from</em> The Usual Suspects, <em>the mysterious Keyser Soeze returns home and finds his wife and small daughter held at gunpoint by the members of a rival mob, he resorts to the radical gesture of shooting his wife and daughter themselves dead—this act enables him mercilessly to pursue members of the rival gang, their families, parents and friends, killing them all... What these three gestures have in common is that in a situation of forced choices, the subject makes the “crazy,” impossible choice of, in a way, striking at himself, at what is the most precious to himself. This act, far from amounting to a case of impotent aggressivity turned against oneself, rather changes the coordinates of the situation in which the subject finds himself: by cutting himself loose from the precious object through whose possession the enemy kept him in check, the subject gains the space of free action. Is not such a radical gesture of “striking at oneself” constitutive of subjectivity as such?</em><br />
<br />
<em>AND, Banning queers may seem backwards and that’s our point. Queers should refuse participation in the military that is repulsed by them. When they strike at their own rights and say NO to the system, they push it to its limits.</em><br />

While all these readings are feasible, we should focus on the more fundamental dimension underlying them: that of the violent passage a l’acte as the only way to break out of an ideological deadlock. Here we are dealing not with the simple tension between the impossible ideological and injunction and subjective resistance to it, but with the double bind inherent to this injunction itself: the injunction’s “explicit” message is redoubled (supplemented, sustained) by an implicit obscene message which says the exact opposite. The “complete” message of the injunction is thus, in the case of the mother: be happy and find fulfillment in the very hell of your home, where you children bombard you with impossible demands, where all your hopes are thwarted! And is not a similar double-bind at work in the multicultural liberal injunction to be tolerant? Here again, the true jouissance makes you sick! This injunction also contains an additional twist which explains why a liberal subject is ready to follow it: “Zero tolerance for any kind of harassment!”, which means that you should tolerate the Other in so far as he himself is tolerant. Tolerance towards the Other thus passes imperceptibly into a destructive hatred of all (“fundamentalist”) Others who do not fit our idea of tolerance—in short, against all actual others. Or – to apply the same logic to the family haven: infinite dedication to one’s children can turn into a destructive rage against real children who do not appreciate their mother’s sacrifice. It is against this double-bind that the (self-destructive passage a l’acte explodes: and it is all too simple to oppose this passage a l’acte directly to the authentic political act. The first reaction to an ideological double-bind has to be a “blind” violent passage a l’acte, which can only later, in a subsequent move, be properly politicized. We simply have to accept the risk that a blind violent outburst will be followed by its proper politicization—there is no short cut here, and no guarantee of a successful outcome either. Horrible as it may sound, we should therefore not simply condemn acts like the one committed by Andrea: we should discern in them a hidden liberating potential. What is a passage a l’acte—this moment of “Speak, hands, for me!”, as Casca puts it in Shakespeare’s <em>Julius Caesar?</em> Perhaps its ultimate cinematic expression is found in Paul Schrader’s and Martin Scorsese’s <em>Taxi Driver,</em> in Travis’s [Robert de Niro] final outburst against the pimps who control the young girl he wants to save [Jodie Foster]. The implicit suicidal dimension of this passage a l’acte is crucial: when Travis is preparing for his attack, he practices drawing the gun in front of the mirror; in what becomes the best-known scene in the film, he addresses his own image in the mirror with an aggressive-condescending “You talkin’ to me?”. In a textbook illustration of Lacan’s notion of the “mirror stage”, the aggressivity here is clearly aimed at onself, at one’s own mirror-image. This suicidal dimension re-emerges at the end of the slaughter scene when Travis, heavily wounded and leaning against the wall, mimics with the forefinger of his right hand a gun aimed at his bloodstained forehead and mockingly triggers it, as if to say: “The true aim of my outburst was myself.” The paradox of Travis is that he perceives himself as part of the degenerate dirt of the city life he wants to eradicate, so that—as Brecht put it apropos of revolutionary violence in <em>The Measure Taken</em>—he wants to be the last piece of dirt after whose removal the room will be clean. In a real-life case of such a deadlock, in 1999 Private Barry Winchell from Fort Campbell US Army base beat to death a fellow soldier who harassed him all the time about his homosexuality. This event is usually quoted as proof of the failure of Bill Clinton’s “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy on gays in the army; what is perhaps more crucial is to perceive how this failure is linked to the tension between explicit symbolic rules and their supplement, the obscene unwritten rules that actually sustain a community. In his unit, Winchell was continually submitted to anti-gay gibes and taunts—not only by his fellow soldiers, but also by his immediate superior, Sergeant Kleifgen. Typically, when Kleifgen was asked why he did not intervene and order the platoon members to stop harassing Winchell, he replied: “Everybody was having fun”—in short, harassing Winchell functioned as the secret obscene male-bonding ritual that cemented the community. (In military jargon, “having fun” – refers as a rule to cruel and humiliating ritualized procedures—take my own experience in the Yugoslav People’s Army, where the supreme example of “having fun” was to pick out a soldier asleep in his bed, tie his testicles with a rope to one of his toes when his legs were not fully stretched, then put a piece of paper between his toes, and set it on fire; when the fire awakened the unfortunate soldier, his automatic reaction was, of course, to stretch out his leg repeatedly, trying to get rid of the burning piece of paper that was causing him pain—in military jargon, this was called “making him ride a bicycle”, and the result could be heard hundreds of miles away…). Again, the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy put Winchell in an unbearable double-bind: he was afraid that if he complained to his superior officers about the harassment, he would break the second part of the policy rule (“don’t tell”)—that is to say, his complaint would involve the act of publicly declaring his gay sexual orientation, which would then eventually lead to his expulsion. In order to break up this double-bind deadlock, he resorted to a physical attack on his most persistent harasser, killing him with a baseball bat. So what should Winchell have done? In abstract terms, instead of acting out and beating the tormenting other to death, he should first have beaten himself up, that is, got rid of his own libidinal investment in the rituals of his humiliation, his own secret participation in them. More concretely, he should have devised a strategy for turning the system against itself by manipulating the split between its explicit rules and their obscene supplement—perhaps, say, he should have summoned up the courage to break the false spirit of group solidarity (“Whatever problems we have, we deal with them among ourselves—a real man doesn’t go outside and complain to others”) and simply denounce his tormentors to the higher authorities for sexually harassing him: if his superiors had asked: “But <em>are</em> you gay?”, he should have accused <em>them</em> of breaking the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” rule. <br />

And DADT is being repealed just to increase the size and scope of the military and thus US imperialism in a desperate attempt to keep heteronormativity, capitalism, patriarchy and oppression of all Others. Queers see the repeal as a pathway towards citizenship, which involvement in a militaristic regime cannot be. Instead, the repeal allows blind militarism to obscure the structural violence happening now. <br />
Nopper, 10. Tamara K (University of Pennsylvania adjunct professor of Asian American studies, PhD in sociology from Temple University<em>jh),</em> Why I Oppose Repealing DADT and Passage of the Dream Act, <em>September 19th, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://bandung1955.wordpress.com/2010/09/19/1156/" rel="nofollow">__http://bandung1955.wordpress.com/2010/09/19/1156/__</a></em><br />
<em>In some ways, I understand why people are supportive of such gestures. The idea that certain identities and status categories, such as gay or lesbian or (undocumented) immigrants are either outlawed or treated as social problems has rightfully generated a great deal of sympathy. And the very real ways that people experience marginalization or discrimination—ranging from a lack of certain rights to violence, including death—certainly indicates that solutions are needed. Further, far too many non-whites have experienced disproportionate disadvantages, surveillance, and discipline from both DADT and anti-immigrant legislation. For example, Black women, some of whom are not lesbians, have been disproportionately discharged from the U.S. military under DADT. And anti-immigrant legislation, policing measures, and vigilante xenophobic racism is motivated by and reinforces white supremacy and white nationalism. Yet both the repeal of DADT and the passage of the DREAM Act will increase the size and power of the U.S. military and the Department of Defense, which is already the largest U.S. employer. Repealing DADT will make it easier for gays and lesbians to openly serve and the Dream Act in its present incarnation may provide a pathway to legal residency and possibly citizenship for some undocumented immigrant young people if they serve two years in the U.S. military or spend an equal amount of time in college. Unsurprisingly, the latter, being pushed by Democrats, is getting support from “many with close ties to the military and higher education.” As the Wall Street Times reports: Pentagon officials support the Dream Act. In its strategic plan for fiscal years 2010-2012, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness cited the Dream Act as a ‘smart’ way to attract quality recruits to the all-volunteer force… ‘Passage of the Dream Act would be extremely beneficial to the U.S. military and the country as a whole,’ said Margaret Stock, a retired West Point professor who studies immigrants in the military. She said it made ‘perfect’ sense to attach it to the defense-authorization bill. Louis Caldera, secretary of the Army under President Bill Clinton, said that as they struggled to meet recruiting goals, ‘recruiters at stations were telling me it would be extremely valuable for these patriotic people to be allowed to serve our country.’ Additionally, in a 2009 Department of Defense strategic plan report, the second strategic goal, “Shape and maintain a mission-ready All Volunteer Force,” lists the DREAM Act as a possible recruitment tool under one of the “performance objectives”: Recruit the All-Volunteer Force by finding smart ways to sustain quality assurance even as we expand markets to fill manning at controlled costs as demonstrated by achieving quarterly recruiting quality and quantity goals, and through expansion of the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) program and the once-medically restricted populations, as well as the DREAM initiative. What concerns me is that far too many liberals and progressives, including those who serve as professional commentators on cable news and/or progressive publications (and some with a seemingly deep affinity for the Democratic Party) have been praising the passage of the DREAM Act. Unsurprising is that many of the same people support the repeal of DADT. While a sincere concern about discrimination may unite both gestures, so too does a lack of critical perspective regarding the U.S. military as one of the main vehicles in the expansion and enforcement of U.S. imperialism, heterosexuality, white supremacy, capitalism, patriarchy, and repression against political dissent and people’s movements in the United States and abroad. Far too many liberals and progressives, including those critical of policies or the squashing of political dissent, take an ambivalent stance on the U.S. military. It is unclear what makes some of these folks unwilling to openly oppose the military state. Perhaps it’s easier than dealing with the backlash from a variety of people, including the many people of color and/or women who are now building long-term careers in the military. Or maybe it’s more amenable to building careers as pundits in both corporate and progressive media, both of which may be critical of some defense spending or “wasted” (read unsuccessful) military efforts but not necessarily of U.S. militarism. Whatever the case, the inclusion of more gays and lesbians and/or undocumented immigrant youth in the U.S. military is not an ethical project given that both gestures are willing to have our communities serve as mercenaries in exchange for certain rights, some of which are never fully guaranteed in a homophobic and white supremacist country. Nor is it pragmatic. By supporting the diversification of the U.S. military we undermine radical democratic possibilities by giving the military state more people, many of whom will ultimately die in combat or develop PTSD and health issues and/or continue nurturing long-term relationships with the U.S. military, including a political affinity with its culture and goals. We will also have a more difficult time challenging projects of privatization, the incurring of huge amounts of debt, and the erosion of rights and protections in other countries—efforts buttressed by the threat of military action—which ultimately affects people in the United States. Of course I am not the first person to raise these concerns. As the comment from Pegues, with which I began, reveals, there are gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender folks, many of them non-white and non-middle class, who promote a queer politic that challenges the heternormative desires of mainstream movements, including that pushed by some LGBT organizations and their purported “allies” within the Democratic party and heternormative people of color organizations. Some of these folks organize for better economic opportunities, access to housing, and safer existences in the civilian sector for poor and working-class LGBTs. And some also openly oppose military recruitment or challenge the push for gays and lesbians to (openly) serve in the military by countering with “Don’t serve” as a slogan. For example, Cecilia Lucas, who grew up in a military family, writes in a 2010 Counter Punch article: “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” is bad policy. It encourages deceit and, specifically, staying in the closet, which contributes to internalized as well as public homophobia, thus perpetuating discrimination and violence against LGBT people. Banning gay people from serving in the military, however, is something I support. Not because I’m anti-gay, nope, I’m one of those queer folks myself. I’m also a woman and would support a law against women serving in the military. Not because I think women are less capable. I would support laws against any group of people serving in the military: people of color, tall people, people between the ages of 25 and 53, white men, poor people, people who have children, people who vote for Democrats—however you draw the boundaries of a group, I would support a law banning them from military service. Because I support outlawing the military. And until that has happened, I support downsizing it by any means necessary, including, in this one particular arena, sacrificing civil rights in the interest of human rights… It is tricky to write an essay that accepts discrimination as a means to an end. In what remains a homophobic, racist, sexist society, I fear enabling a slippery slope of arguments for identity-based discrimination. Although, of course, the entire notion of citizens who are “protected” by a military discriminates against people based on the identity factor of nationality. Hence my point about human rights trumping civil rights. My argument that we should be fighting against, not for, gay people’s inclusion in the military is not actually about gay people at all. Nor is it about wanting others to do our dirty work for us. As I said, I think everyone should be banned from military service. But if the goal is demilitarization, fighting for even more people to have the right to join the military makes no sense. There are plenty of other civil rights denied gay people for which we still need to fight—civil rights that do not trample on others’ human rights. As Lucas’s comments reveal, opposing LGBT folks from serving openly in the military is not to condone the harassment and unfair surveillance that they experience; nor is it meant to support a culture that suggests they should stay in the closet in the name of military stability and national security. Rather, it is to discourage the attractiveness of military enlistment as well as martial citizenship, a process that provides marginalized groups a “pathway to citizenship” via military service. More, opposition to people serving in the military is also grounded in an understanding that the military negatively impacts practically everyone in the world (including those in the United States), and in particular people of color and/or women and/or gays and lesbians, and not just those who are discriminated against while serving or who are expected to serve as pathways to citizenship or access to education.</em><br />

<em>That said, why on earth would anyone want to enlist right now? The two unpopular wars we're fighting barely even came up in the midterm elections. Except with gays -- for some reason we're eager to join in the fight. Dan Choi, the poster boy for repeal, recently equated the bullying that the legislature engages in by keeping DADT in place with the bullying that's caused a rash of teen suicides that shocked the gay community. OK, so I guess all gays agree that bullying is a bad thing. And that no one should do it, right? As the most hawkish nation, the US is the biggest and meanest bully in the world! Yet Choi and others want participate in its actions abroad? It's not logical. Either bullying is wrong or it isn't. While the schoolyard bullies harass people verbally the Pentagon flies soldiers to occupy foreign countries for indefinite killing sprees. Oh, but we call</em> <u>that</u> <em>Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Iraq war is a blight on our nation's reputation and the healing can never begin until we've aired out this festering sore. It was a huge mistake and yet we're still at it? You shouldn't seek to fight in it -- you should seek to fight against it ever being waged in the first place. We also need to combat whatever conditions made it possible to be tricked into such a gruesome mess so that it never happens again. Those conditions would include recognizing that George W. Bush couldn't have gone to war if it weren't for Americans' own bloodthirsty wish to avenge 9/11 in the wrong country and also the failure of the media, which even liberal bastions CNN and the</em> <u>New York Times</u> <em>admitted to, to ask harder questions of the Bush administration leading up to the war. I'm not so such a naive peacenik that I'd suggest disbanding that the military. Of course we need a trained reserve of brave men and women ready to protect us from attacks. But that's not what the military's been up to in Iraq, is it? They're protecting the profits of the military industrial complex's kingpins and that's not a noble cause to lay your life down for. Nor is fighting Al Qaeda in Afghanistan long after they've left the country. Far from enhancing our nation's security, our actions in that part of the world will probably spark generations of future terrorists to attack us. And we're sent into battle by a legislature full of fat cats which mostly never served, but they'll gladly send pawns to do their dirty work protecting the wealth of the corporations which line their pockets. During the Bush years, the Pentagon prevented images of soldiers' coffins from being shown on the news. I guess the dead ones might discourage new recruits. And at all costs, we must keep on playing this dirty game which the troops always lose. Now if gays just want any job in a crummy economy and can stand bloodshed and withstand post-traumatic stress disorder, then the military's a fine choice. But perhaps an independent contractor could hire you instead. They may not offer the same benefits as military service and there are no medals to be won, but you're still technically working for the US government. You won't be hampered by all of those pesky military regulations and you can continue to work long after combat has ended. There can be no honor from serving in a shameful war. Anyone attempting to enlist now is condoning the horrors of it. If fairness and equality is really the concern of gay people, then we can't sign up to use force to impose our misguided will as we've been doing in Iraq for almost a decade. As people who've been bullied ourselves, we of all people must value compassion. Dan Choi has <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/10/25/85626/427" rel="nofollow">__claimed__</a> that &quot;War is a force that gives us meaning.&quot; Anyone who needs to obtain their meaning from something as depraved as preemptive attacks against innocent countries is at odds with any civil rights movement I can conceive of. Last night on Rachel Maddow, discharged Lt. Colonel. Victor Fehrenbach described his service by saying &quot;It's my life.&quot; Too bad that he can't live his &quot;life&quot; without causing someone else's death. Of course gays deserve civil rights. But Iraqis deserve them just as much as we do.</em><br />

<em>And the impact – an unquestioning attitude towards this system of violence kills more than any war. The invisibility of the violence we outline only makes it more potent. Only death of the system solves.</em><br />

It has often been observed that America is a truly violent nation, as shown by the thousands of cases of social and communal violence that occurs daily in the nation.  Every year, some 20,000 people are killed by others, and additional 20,000 folks kill themselves. Add to this the nonlethal violence that Americans daily inflict on each other, and we begin to see the tracings of a nation immersed in a fever of violence.  But, as remarkable, and harrowing as this level and degree of violence is, it is, by far, not the most violent features of living in the midst of the American empire.  We live, equally immersed, and to a deeper degree, in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging &quot;structural' violence, of a kind that destroys human life with a breathtaking ruthlessness. Former Massachusetts prison official and writer Dr. James Gilligan observes: By &quot;structural violence&quot; I mean the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted by those who are above them. Those excess deaths (or at least a demonstrably large proportion of them) are a function of the class structure; and that structure is itself a product of society's collective human choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the society. … every fifteen years, on the average, as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths; and every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews over a six-year period. This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world. --(Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New York: Vintage, 1996), 192.)  This form of violence, not covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected media, is invisible to us and because of its invisibility, all the more insidious. How dangerous is it--really? Gilligan notes:  [E]very fifteen years, on the average, as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths; and every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews over a six-year period. This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world. [Gilligan, p. 196]  Worse still, in a thoroughly capitalist society, much of that violence became internalized, turned back on the Self, because, in a society based on the priority of wealth, those who own nothing are taught to loathe themselves, as if something is inherently wrong with themselves, instead of the social order that promotes this self-loathing. This intense self-hatred was often manifested in familial violence as when the husband beats the wife, the wife smacks the son, and the kids fight each other.  This vicious, circular, and invisible violence, unacknowledged by the corporate media, uncriticized in substandard educational systems, and un- understood by the very folks who suffer in its grips, feeds on the spectacular and more common forms of violence that the system makes damn sure -that we can recognize and must react to it.  This fatal and systematic violence may be called The War on the Poor.  It is found in every country, submerged beneath the sands of history, buried, yet ever present, as omnipotent as death. In the struggles over the commons in Europe, when the peasants struggled and lost their battles for their commonal lands (a precursor to similar struggles throughout Africa and the Americas), this violence was sanctified, by church and crown, as the 'Divine Right of Kings' to the spoils of class battle. Scholars Frances Fox-Piven and Richard A Cloward wrote, in The New Class War (Pantheon, 1982/1985):  They did not lose because landowners were immune to burning and preaching and rioting. They lost because the usurpations of owners were regularly defended by the legal authority and the armed force of the state. It was the state that imposed increased taxes or enforced the payment of increased rents, and evicted or jailed those who could not pay the resulting debts. It was the state that made lawful the appropriation by landowners of the forests, streams, and commons, and imposed terrifying penalties on those who persisted in claiming the old rights to these resources. It was the state that freed serfs or emancipated sharecroppers only to leave them landless. (52)  The &quot;Law&quot;, then, was a tool of the powerful to protect their interests, then, as now. It was a weapon against the poor and impoverished, then, as now.  It punished retail violence, while turning a blind eye to the wholesale violence daily done by their class masters.  The law was, and is, a tool of state power, utilized to protect the status quo, no matter how oppressive that status was, or is.  Systems are essentially ways of doing things that have concretized into tradition, and custom, without regard to the rightness of those ways. No system that causes this kind of harm to people should be allowed to remain, based solely upon its time in existence. Systems must serve life, or be discarded as a threat and a danger to life.  Such systems must pass away, so that their great and terrible violence passes away with them. <br />

Contention 3 is the Future is Kid Stuff: <br />
<br />
First – Evaluate the debate through the lens of queer representations and from the standpoint of the oppressed. <br />
Miller, 98 [Diane Helene, Ph.D. in Women’s Studies from U-Connecticut, former Director of the Writing and Communication Center at East Tennessee State University; Freedom to Differ, <br />
The privileges granted to heterosexual individuals and couples must either be revoked or distributed fairly to all. This is but one element of a larger strategy to dismantle compulsory heterosexuality in all its many forms (Rich 1986). It is unlikely, and possibly undesirable, that we could entirely do away with the institutions that create the social fabric—those of romantic partnership and family, structures of community, and systems of law and education, to name just a few. Instead of trying to envision a world without these, we might instead imagine ways to redefine these institutions in fundamental ways. In some cases, the problem lies primarily in recognizing and legitimizing new forms that are already taking shape—a question of ideology lagging behind practice. The title of Kath Weston's Families We Choose (/99I), for example, coins a phrase that accurately describes the formation of many families today, and not only gay and lesbian families (see Collins 1991). The concept of domestic partnership, while theoretically based on the model of heterosexual marriage and often employed this way in civil rights arguments, represents in practice a tremendous range of committed relationships that patriarchal ideology does not account for. Some of these relationships between gay men or lesbians may look very much like the heterosexual model. Others resemble it very little or not at all. It is equally important to note that many of today's heterosexual relationships bear little resemblance to this alleged &quot;norm.&quot; If our goal is not simply to reproduce the structure of the nuclear family in our own communities, neither is it to replace one privileged family form with another. The term family, like the concept of a committed partnership between two adults, needs to be understood in much more varied and multifaceted ways than it has been in the past. The fact that there is no term that most gays and lesbians find appropriate to express the nature of their intimate relationships suggests that the recognition of these relationships has the potential to transform available understandings of relationships more broadly, for all kinds of people.3 Nonetheless, we surrender the transformative potential inherent in these other ways of living and loving when we trade pride in ourselves and our own ways of being for provisional tolerance from the mainstream. It is the cost of this limited acceptance, as the cases of Achtenberg and Cammermeyer illustrate, that we must keep in the forefront of our consciousness. If we do not, it will exact its price from us unaware. The very language of the military ban, its label as a &quot;compromise,&quot; alerts us to its failings. Constitutional rights are not available for negotiation or compromise. They can be neither partial nor conditional, for when compromised, they no longer represent the full freedoms guaranteed to all of us. We must therefore always be dissatisfied with acceptance at the price of assimilation, or with any partial granting of institutional access that demands the sacrifice of other basic rights. This is not to say there will not be compromises and half steps along the way or that we should reject all but total liberation. Undoubtedly, change will occur only incrementally. The notion of a total Marxist-style revolution neither is realistic nor, possibly, is it even in our best interest. But we must not be misled into believing that provisional tolerance is authentic acceptance or that the denial of difference makes difference disappear. As much as we might wish it were otherwise, assimilation offers no protection against the most terrible manifestations of prejudice and discrimination—a lesson we take from the assimilated Jews in Nazi Germany. We can be &quot;model&quot; citizens, hide or deny our difference, and silence ourselves. Still, the stereotypes that incite hatred and violence against us will persist and resurface at the moment we ask for too much or seem to have acquired too much power or privilege. The myth, and consequent danger, of a civil rights approach is the belief that if we ask &quot;nicely&quot; enough, show that we can &quot;be-have&quot; well enough, and demonstrate obedience within the framework of compulsory heterosexuality, then we will be accepted as &quot;normal&quot; people who simply have unusual bed partners. The potential for even such provisional acceptance can be tempting. For those of us forced to live with rejection, &quot;the notion that homosexuality has been mainstreamed is an illusion we yearn to believe because we are so tired of being vilified, loathed, and marginalized.We want to be accepted and loved&quot; (Vaid 1995, 5). Nevertheless, this is a temptation to be resisted. We must resist it not only because of the psychic damage involved in hiding our loves, restricting our lives, and silencing our voices; we must also reject it for more pragmatic reasons. Despite its apparent promise, this assimilationist approach will not make us safe. Disappearance does not erase difference, nor does it substantially alter its consequences. Try as we might to &quot;blend in&quot; and be like &quot;everyone else,&quot; even those of us who can succeed are never assured of safety. As long as our difference can be targeted, discovered, and punished, we will not be safe. Just as important, the apparent blending in of some of us only accentuates the difference of others who cannot or choose not to blend in. We abandon this group when we make assimilation our aim (Vaid 1995). Those of us who most closely resemble the mainstream seemingly have the most to gain from assimilation, but we are also at the greatest risk for developing a false sense of security. Assimilation entices us to sacrifice our own brilliantly different &quot;colors&quot; in exchange for the perceived safety of mainstream acceptance. However, our fragmentation and self-denial are too high a price to pay for such conditional and tenuous &quot;acceptance.&quot; Our best efforts to &quot;blend in&quot; must always remain illusory and fleeting. At any time, we may he plucked out of the complacency of perceived assimilation by those whose perspective on difference sees not complex human beings but only isolated elements of identity. When these elements are perceived as fearful and threatening, they are despised and therefore targeted for destruction. THE POWER OF OPENNESS AND THE PROTECTION OF SPEECH Another issue this book raises is the need to protect lesbian and gay self-expression. Visibility and voice are often sacrificed in civil rights strategies through their designation as prohibited conduct. This leaves dominant hierarchies of power and privilege intact. The trade-off demanded by the dominant ideology is the granting of rights only on the condition that other demands are withdrawn. For rights to be awarded, the more disruptive challenges raised by political voice and visibility must be quieted. &quot;Sex and gender outsiders—gay men, transsexuals, lesbians, bisexuals—are constantly invited to lose their voices, or suffer the consequences (job loss, baseball bats) of using them.&quot; Consequently, &quot;'don't tell' is more than a U.S. military policy; it remains U.S. public policy, formally and informally, on sex and gender nonconformity&quot; (Gamson 1996, 8o). At stake here is not only the self-identity of lesbians and gay men as such bin also the ability to tell our stories and share our lives, The ability to speak of oneself in one's own terms, to tell the story of one's life, marks the difference between existence and nonexistence, community and isolation, pride and shame. Both our self-images and the images others have of us depend on our freedom to share our stories. The importance of stories in changing others' attitudes cannot be overestimated, for &quot;our stories hold the power of persuasion. We must counter disinformation with the truth of our lives&quot; (Vaid 1993, 28). Ensuring that such speech is protected must remain a primary goal of the lesbian and gay rights movement, for &quot;openness has enormous power in the politics of personal relationships,&quot; an arena that legal initiatives cannot reliably access or influence (Kopkind 1993, 8). This is why individual acts of coming out as lesbian or gay have always comprised a key strategy of the movement. Despite their ambiguities, such acts are still recognized as one of the most effective means of increasing support for gay and lesbian rights. They facilitate an understanding of gays and lesbians as multifaceted human beings instead of one-dimensional sexual creatures. For these and other reasons, &quot;the first need for our politics is the guarantee that [our words and voices] will be heard&quot; (Phelan 1993, 779). What can we do to create space for these stories and an audience for these voices? We must begin by critically examining our own individual filters, the lenses through which we perceive and classify difference and the ways in which we talk about difference. We must recognize, perhaps with some surprise, that although we may not be politicians or lawyers, the language we choose and the thoughts we express may have a tremendous influence on those around us. Our choice of language speaks volumes to our children and families, our friends and coworkers, and all the various communities of which we are a part, We need to be aware of how the public discourse around us shapes our own attitudes and beliefs and how the expression of our opinions influences the attitudes of others. We need to make choices about how we represent ourselves and each other, rather than uncritically adopting the ready-made categories and distinctions our culture imposes. Ultimately, all sexuality and sexual orientations need to be understood as falling along a continuum of possibilities, rather than as a set of categories by which to divide and label human beings (see Kinsey, Pomeroy, and Martin 1948; Institute for Sex Research 1953; Snitow, Stansell, and Thompson 1986). The idea that identities are socially constructed is not an abstract theory divorced from the everyday world. On the contrary, varying understandings of identity permeate all of our lives. They influence the degree of freedom we have in our choices of whom we can become and whom we can love. The act of coming out often implies choosing a category, rejecting one label or box only to adopt another. To foster a liberatory vision, this concept might be better understood as an ongoing process, a becoming, or a &quot;coming into oneself.&quot; In such a reinterpretation, rather than selecting from among preexisting, ready-made categories, we would refuse the system of categorization for the purposes of self-understanding. Coming out would then denote a process of transition and growth accessible to anyone, not only gays and lesbians. It would be a process of learning to trust our own voices and listen to our own hearts. Instead of a transition that closes one off from loving half the world, coming into oneself means opening oneself to loving those whom we were formerly forbidden to love. It represents an expansion, not a reduction, of possibilities. Allowing individuals to name themselves is a tremendously empowering act that has applications to a variety of concrete settings. When we label people, we narrow their possibilities, presenting them with a limited selection of categories from which to choose. To a degree, this is a necessary process. Labels lend order and predictability to our world. They allow us to recognize and ally ourselves with others who share our self-identification, fostering personal as well as political empowerment. Nevertheless, the labels and categories our culture provides are neither natural nor sacred. They are constructions of language and the other institutions that organize our society, from education to religion to law. They are not universal, either across epicures or across history. Thus these labels must be presented and used with considerable care and mindfulness, when used at all. When we extend them to others as possibilities, we must exercise particular tentativeness, attentive to tile ways in which the complexity of individuals exceeds the bounds of any given category. The need for such caution extends to all who are entrusted with educating others about difference: teachers, counselors, religious leaders, and parents, to name but a few. How we learn to think and talk about difference, whether our own or someone else's, leaves an indelible impression on how we perceive ourselves in relation to the world around us. Our responsibility extends beyond reconsidering our own uses of the labels and stereotypes that reduce the richness of individual variation to a meager set of options. We must also actively resist and challenge the reductive definitions and misleading representations that others perpetuate. This act requires a courageous willingness to speak out against bigotry and hatred. The word courage is derived from the Latin word coy, meaning &quot;heart.&quot; It is in the brave act of standing up for ourselves and for other oppressed groups that we truly act with heart. In the debates surrounding Achtenberg and Cammermeyer, opponents disseminated a litany of destructive and demeaning stereotypes of gays and lesbians. While supporters denounced such negative images, they often failed to advance alternative, diverse representations of lesbians and gays. The support we see in these cases amounts most often to tolerance of difference, but few seem willing to embrace difference actively. Instead, they are silenced by the fear of familiar accusations: of &quot;flaunting&quot; sexuality, of ramming it down others' throats, of advocating a &quot;homosexual lifestyle.&quot; Such phrases coerce us all into invisibility and silence by suggesting that if only we would behave correctly, if only we would be appropriately quiet, discreet, and private, we would somehow win the favor of the mainstream and be granted our rights. This is the premise that underlies an assimilationist agenda. It encourages us to believe that, indeed, our silence will protect us. Such a belief is but another weapon in the armory of our oppressors. As we have seen repeatedly, no matter what we do or refrain from doing, no matter how discreet we attempt to be, nothing less than absolute silence and complete closetedness is acceptable to those who condemn us. As a result, accusations of &quot;flaunting it&quot; will occur in response to any kind of honesty about ourselves, any verbal or physical expression that can be interpreted as conveying who we are. We know, as well, from the experiences of other minority groups that attempting to win favor from those in power through (“good behavior&quot; or patience has never been a successful strategy for attaining equality or liberation. We must refuse to be cowed into silence and invisibility by such accusations. Such a response will gain us nothing, despite what our opponents would have us believe. We need to abandon the belief that silence, discretion, and patience will eventually win us our rights. Instead, we must speak up, come out, and present our society with alternatives to the narrow, stereotypical, hypersexual images of gays and lesbians that still dominate public discourse and the public imagination. We need to be advocates, to &quot;flaunt it.&quot; We need to counter forcefully the destructive portrayals that reduce us to sex, that deny the complexity of our lives, that ignore the diversity within our movement, and that force us into a single mold that is male, white, and middle-class. In providing alternatives, we must offer not one but many, so as not to repeat the mistake of homogenizing our movement. We need to offer a multitude of different perspectives and different representations of lesbians and gays. This means that in our own movement, we need to promote diverse expression and actively pursue diverse representation. We must not depend on a few celebrities to come out for all of us or permit a small number of high-profile professionals to provide our primary representations. As many of us as possible, from all of our varied lesbian and gay communities, need to come out so that we may be seen in all of our diversity and our wholeness. We need to come out in different forums, so that we can be seen for &quot;all of who we are&quot; (Beck 1982, xxx). We need to present ourselves as parents, grandparents, daughters, sons, teachers, clergy, and workers in every field; as rich and poor, young and old, able-bodied and disabled; as women and men of different religions, races, and nationalities. We must refuse to collaborate in or to promote stereotypes of others in our movement or of other minority groups. In bolstering and perpetuating stereotypes, we demean not only others but also ourselves. We must, finally, demand to be seen and to be heard, not only erasing the picture that hatred has painted of us but providing our own, more accurate and more complete portrait of ourselves and the world that we hope to create. Far from the ugly, threatening image our opponents advance, lesbian and gay visions of the future have much practical and moral value for the rest of the world. Their components include the freedom of self-expression, newfound respect for families of all configurations, encouragement to listen to our hearts and trust where they lead, an escape from the constraints of those labels and boxes that confine or suffocate individual minds and spirits, and tile right to love whomever we choose without penalty or fear. This is not some monstrous &quot;gay agenda&quot; that attacks families, children, religion, and morality. However, that is what our opponents would have the public believe, must have them believe in order to perpetuate hatred and fear. The way to counter these predominant images is not to remain silent or hidden but to make our own visions come alive by speaking honestly of our-selves, our lives, and the transformations we hope to achieve. This is our duty regardless of our own sexual orientation, regardless of the breadth of our sphere of influence. Every one of us must participate in this effort, in every possible forum, at every possible opportunity, wherever we can do so without unduly risking our safety or sacrificing those things we must have to survive. In creating this alternative image, a portrait forever in process, the artistic vision of each of us is not only welcome but vital. When we all speak and act, when we create a vivid and colorful mosaic with the stories of our lives, only then will those around us begin to see us and hear us as we are, and as we can be. <br />

Prefer status quo impacts to future ones – deference to the future reproduces heteronormativity because it priviledges the child which is the product of heterosexual unions over the suffering and annihilation of queers in the status quo<br />

<em>Bernard Law, the former cardinal of Boston, mistaking (or maybe understanding too well) the degree of authority bestowed on him by the signifier of his patronymic, denounced in 1996 proposed legislation giving health care benefits to same-sex partners of municipal employees. He did so by proclaiming, in a noteworthy instance of piety in the sky, that bestowing such access to health care would profoundly diminish the marital bond. “Society,” he opined, “has a special interest in the protection, care and upbringing of children. Because marriage remains the principal, and the best, framework for the nurture, education and socialization of children, the state has a special interest in marriage.” With this fatal embrace of a futurism so blindly committed to the figure of the Child that it will justify refusing health care benefits to the adults that some children become, Law lent his voice to the mortifying mantra of a communal jouissance that depends on the fetishization of the Child at the expense of whatever such fetishization must inescapably queer. Some seven years later, after Law had resigned for his failure to protect Catholic children from sexual assault by pedophile priests, Pope John Paul II returned to this theme, condemning state-recognized same-sex unions as parodic versions of authentic families, “based on individual egoism” rather than genuine love. Justifying that condemnation, he observed, “Such a ‘caricature’ has no future and cannot give future to any society.” Queers must respond to the violent force of such constant provocations not only by insisting on our equal rights to the social order’s prerogatives, not only by avowing our capacity to promote that order’s coherence and integrity, but also by saying explicitly what Law and the Pope and the whole of the Symbolic order for which they stand here anyway in each and every expression or manifestation of queer sexuality: Fuck the social order and the Child in whose name we’re collectively terrorized; fuck Annie; fuck the waif from</em> Les Mis<em>; fuck the poor, innocent kid on the Net; Fuck Laws both with capital ls and with small; fuck the whole network of Symbolic relations and the future that serves as its prop. We might like to believe that with patience, with work, with generous contributions to lobbying groups or generous participations in activists group or generous doses of legal savvy and electoral sophistication, the future will hold a place for us—a place at the political table that won’t have to come at the cost of the places we seek in the bed or the bar or the baths. But there are no queers in that future as there can be no future for queers, chosen as they are to bear the bad tidings that there can be no future at all: that the future, as Annie’s hymn to the hope of “Tomorrow” understands, is “always/A day/Away.” Like the lovers on Keat’s Grecian urn, forever “near the goal” of a union they’ll never in fact achieve, we’re held in thrall by a future continually deferred by time itself, constrained to pursue the dream of a day when today and tomorrow are one. That future is nothing but kid stuff, reborn each day to screen out the grave that gapes from within the lifeless letter, luring us into, ensnaring us in, reality’s gossamer web. Those queered by the social order that projects its death drive onto them are no doubt positioned as well to recognize the irreducibility of that fantasy and the cost of construing it as contingent to the logic of social organization as such. Acceding to this figural identification with the undoing of identity, which is also to say with the disarticulation of social and Symbolic form, might well be described, in John Brenkman’s words, as “politically self-destructive.” But politics (as the social elaboration of reality) and the self (as mere prosthesis maintaining the future for the figural Child), are what queerness, again as figure, necessarily destroys—necessarily insofar as this “self” is the agent of reproductive futurism and this “politics” the means of its promulgation as the order of social reality. But perhaps, as Lacan’s engagement with Antigone in Seminar 7 suggests, political self-destruction inheres in the only act that counts as one: the act of resisting enslavement to the future in the name of having a life. If the fate of the queer is to figure the fate that cuts the thread of futurity, if the jouissance, the corrosive enjoyment, intrinsic to queer (non)identity annihilates the fetishistic jouissance that works to consolidate identity by allowing reality to coagulate around its ritual reproduction, then the only oppositional status to which our queerness could ever lead would depend on our taking seriously the place of the death drive we’re called on to figure and insisting, against the cult of the Child and the political order it enforces, that we, as Guy Hocquenghem made clear, are “not the signifier of what might become a new form of ‘social organization,’” that we do not intend a new politics, a better society, a brighter tomorrow, since all of these fantasies reproduce the past, through displacement, in the form of the future. We choose, instead, not to choose the Child, as disciplinary image of the Imaginary past or as site of a projective identification with an always impossible future. The queerness we propose, in Hocquenghem’s words, “is unaware of the passing of generations’… [it] knows that civilization alone is mortal.” Even more: it delights in that mortality as the negation of everything that would define itself, moralistically, as pro-life. It is we who must bury the subject in the tomb-like hollow of the signifier, pronouncing at last the words for which we’re condemned should we speak them or not: that we are the advocates of abortion; that the Child as futurity’s emblem must die; that the future is mere repetition and just as lethal as the past. Our queerness has nothing to offer a Symbolic that lives by denying that nothingness except an insistence on the haunting excess that this nothingness entails, an insistence on the negativity that pierces the fantasy screen of futurity, shattering narrative temporality with irony’s always explosive force. And so what is queerest about us, queerest within us, and queerest despite us is that willingness to insist intransitively—to insist that the future stop here.</em><br />

<em>Finally, the plan prevents the extermination of subjectivity by standing in opposition the exclusion created by the compromise inherent within liberal democracy and exposing the invisible violence at the root of all violence.</em><br />
<em>Zizek 2009 Slavoj New Left Review n57pg 53-55</em><br />
<em>What one should add here, moving beyond Kant, is thatthere are social groups which, on account of their lack of a determinate place in the ‘private’ order of social hierarchy, stand directly for universality:they are what Jacques Rancière calls the ‘part of no part’ of the social body.All truly emancipatory politics is generated by the short-circuit between the universality of the public use of reason and the universality of the ‘part of no part’.This was already the communist dream of the young Marx—to bring together the universality of philosophy with the universality of the proletariat.From Ancient Greece, we have a name for the intrusion of the excluded into the socio-political space: democracy.</em><br />
<em>The predominant liberal notion of democracy also deals with those excluded, but in a radically different mode: it focuses on their inclusion, as minority voices. All positions should be heard, all interests taken into account, the human rights of everyone guaranteed, all ways of life, cultures and practices respected, and so on. The obsession of this democracy is the protection of all kinds of minorities: cultural, religious, sexual, etc.The formula of democracy here consists of patient negotiation and compromise. What gets lost in this is the position of universality embodied in the excluded. The new emancipatory politics will no longer be the act of a particular social agent, but an explosive combination of different agents.What unites us is that, in contrast to the classic image of proletarians who have ‘nothing to lose but their chains’, we are in danger of losing everything. The threat is that we will be reduced to an abstract, empty Cartesian subject dispossessed of all our symbolic content,with our genetic base manipulated, vegetating in an unliveable environment. This triple threat makes us all proletarians, reduced to ‘substanceless subjectivity’, as Marx put it in the Grundrisse. The figure of the ‘part of no part’ confronts us with the truth of our own position; andthe ethico-political challenge is to recognize ourselves in this figure. In a way, we are all excluded, from nature as well as from our symbolic substance. Today, we are all potentially homo sacer, and the only way to avoid actually becoming so is to act preventively.</em><br />

<strong>Speaking for others is necessary to empower the silenced</strong><br />
<strong>Sells 1997</strong> (Laura, Instructor of Speech Communication at Louisiana State University, “On Feminist Civility: Retrieving the Political in the Feminist Public Forum”, this paper was presented at a Roundtable on &quot;Public Speaking and the Feminist Public Sphere: Doing Difference Differently,&quot; at the Western States Communication Association conference, 1997.) <br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><u>In her recent article, &quot;The Problems of Speaking For Others,&quot; Linda Alcoff points out the ways in which this retreat rhetoric has actually become an evasion of political responsibility. Alcoff's arguments are rich and their implications are many, but one implication is relevant to a vital feminist public forum. The retreat from speaking for others politically dangerous because it erodes public discourse. First, the retreat response presumes that we can, indeed, &quot;retreat to a discrete location and make singular claims that are disentangled from other's locations.&quot; Alcoff calls this a &quot;false ontological configuration&quot; in which we ignore how our social locations are always already implicated in the locations of others.</u> The position of &quot;not speaking for others&quot; thus becomes an alibi that allows individuals to avoid responsibility and accountability for their effects on others. The retreat, then, is actually a withdrawal to an individualist realm, a move that reproduces an individualist ideology and privatizes the politics of experience. <u>As she points out, this move creates a protected form of speech in which the individual is above critique because she is not making claims about others. This protection also gives the speaker immunity from having to be &quot;true&quot; to the experiences and needs of others. As a form of protected speech, then, &quot;not speaking for others&quot; short-circuits public debate by disallowing critique and avoiding responsibility to the other. Second, the retreat response undercuts the possibility of political efficacy. Alcoff illustrates this point with a list of people--Steven Biko, Edward Said, Rigoberta Menchu--who have indeed spoken for others with significant political impact. As she bluntly puts it, both collective action and coalition necessitate speaking for others.</u></span><br />

<strong>Speaking for others is justified – it brings the collective experience of a group into perspective.</strong><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><u>We return to the intuitive response to the struggle of oppressed groups: have the group speak for itself. Speaking becomes a type of agency in which I construct myself because contrary to a Cartesian self, selves do not exist prior to or separate from language. To lose my speech is to lose myself. The oppressed have the ability to communicate with each other and through their language game they are able to discuss their struggle with one another. Sharing languages games enables the oppressed to a specific, limited dimension of power. Their language game will always fail to communicate their struggle to those who have not been initiated into it. They have direct access to the experience of oppression and their agency, but they can only reach their own group.</u> Those on the margin cannot reach those in the center. On the other hand, those in the center, the elites, share a language that can reach the majority of society. It is a language game they are familiar with and can use adeptly. However, they do not have the experience with or access to the language game of the oppressed. <u>They have the power to use their language but nothing to say</u>. The catch-22 is the choice between a group who embodies the agency and the dimensions of political struggle against oppression without a way to communicate it to the larger community, and a group with the language to reach society but is ignorant of the political struggle. <u>There lies a need for a synergy between the experience of the oppressed on the margins and the language game of those in the center. The synergy requires a speaker who comes from the oppressed but has knowledge of the language game of the center</u>. Such a person could incorporate the experience of the oppressed into a new language game that could be accessed by those in power. The concern is what is lost and sacrificed in translation. If the language games are so disparate that initiation in one, offers no insight into the rules of the other, than there is doubt that translation can be done at all. If translation cannot be done, the best to be hoped for is cooption forcing the margins into the mainstream. What then is the solution? I agree with bell hooks that the oppressed mist celebrate their position on the margins. The oppressed should not try to move into the center but appreciate their counterculture. <u>The oppressed must produce intellectuals so that the dominated can speak to the dominating</u>. The idea goes back to Antonio Gramsci’s concept of the organic intellectual.7 The elites are indoctrinated in the ruling ideology and have an investment in the current order. No matter how progressive their politics may be, the elite will always be the elite. <u>Their investment in the current social order precludes offers of true systemic change. Gramsci writes of the need for the working class to develop its own intellectuals who are organically tied to their class. This argument is similar to hooks’ argument. The margin must produce organic intellectuals. It might be thought that these organic intellectuals should translate between language games. But as hooks points out, using “the oppressor’s language” is not adequate because it cannot articulate the experience of the oppressed. Yet, it is the only language game the oppressing can play. Organic intellectuals affect the center from the margins if they are able to incorporate multiple voices in the texts they create.</u></span><br />

<strong>Finding an alternative to speaking for others is impossible. Your alternative assumes we all have clear-cut identities and only reifies the structures of difference which cause oppression in the first place.</strong><br />
<strong>Alcoff 1992</strong> (Linda Martín Alcoff,  Department of Philosophy  Syracuse University, “The Problem with Speaking for Others” <em>Cultural Critique</em> (Winter 1991-92), pp. 5-32 <br />
As social <u>theorists</u>, we <u>are authorized by virtue of our academic positions to develop theories that express and encompass the ideas, needs, and goals of others.</u> <u>However,</u> <u>we must begin to ask ourselves</u> whether this is ever a legitimate authority, and if so, what are the criteria for legitimacy? In particular, <u>is it ever valid to speak for others who are unlike me</u> or who are less privileged than me? We might try to delimit this problem as only arising when a more privileged person speaks for a less privileged one. In this case, we might say that I should only speak for groups of which I am a member. But this does not tell us how groups themselves should be delimited. For example, can a white woman speak for all women simply by virtue of being a woman? If not, how narrowly should we draw the categories? <u>The complexity and multiplicity of group identifications could result in &quot;communities&quot; composed of single individuals.</u> <u>Moreover,</u> <u>the concept of groups assumes specious notions about clear-cut boundaries and &quot;pure&quot; identities.</u> I am a Panamanian-American and a person of mixed ethnicity and race: half white/Angla and half Panamanian mestiza. The criterion of group identity leaves many unanswered questions for a person such as myself, since I have membership in many conflicting groups but my membership in all of them is problematic. <u>Group identities and boundaries are ambiguous and permeable, and decisions about demarcating identity are always partly arbitrary. Another problem concerns how specific an identity needs to be to confer epistemic authority. Reflection on such problems quickly reveals that no easy solution to the problem of speaking for others can be found by simply restricting the practice to speaking for groups of which one is a member.</u><br />

 <strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Reject the politics of fear –</span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> this form of motivation precludes accepting and confronting difference – since the queer is the target of fear based politics. This is the ideal form of biopolitics – resulting in the systematic massacre of populations in the name of “society” – that’s Dean </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;">Zizek 2008</span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Slavoj Violence p 40-41</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Today’s predominant mode of politics is post-political bio-politics</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">—</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 6pt;">an awesome example of theoretical jargon which, however, can easily be unpacked: “post-political” is a politics which claims to leave behind old ideological struggles and instead focus on expert management and administration, while “bio-politics” designates the regulation of the security and welfare of human lives as its primary goal.’ It is clear how these two dimensions overlap: once one renounces big ideological causes, what remains is only the efficient administration of life... almost only that. That is to say,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> with the depoliticised, socially objective, expert administration and coordination of interests as the zero level of politics, the only way to introduce passion into this field, to actively mobilise people, is through fear,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;"> a basic constituent of today’s subjectivity.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> For this reason, bio-politics is ultimately a politics of fear; </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">it focuses on defence from potential victimisation or harassment.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia;"> This is what separates a radical emancipatory politics from our political status quo. We’re talking here not about the difference between two visions, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">or sets of axioms,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> but about the difference between politics based on a set of universal axioms and a politics which renounces the very constitutive dimension of the political, since it resorts to fear as its ultimate mobilising principle: </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">fear of immigrants, fear of crime, fear of godless sexual depravity, fear of the excessive state itself, with its burden of high taxation, fear of ecological catastrophe, fear of harassment.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Political correctness is the exemplary liberal form of the politics of fear. Such a (post-)politics always relies on the manipulation of a paranoid ochios or multitude: it is the frightening rallying of frightened people.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 6pt;">Thus the big event of 2006 was when anti-immigration politics went mainstream and finally cut the umbilical cord that had connected it to far-right fringe parties. From France to Germany, from Austria to Holland, in the new spirit of pride in cultural and historical identity, the main parties now found it acceptable to stress that immigrants are guests who must accommodate themselves to the cultural values that define the host society— “It is our country, love it or leave it</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Today’s liberal tolerance towards others, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">the respect of otherness and openness towards it,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> is counterpointed by an obsessive fear of harassment. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">In short, the Other is just fine, but only insofar as his presence is not intrusive, insofar as this Other is not really other. . . In a strict homology with the paradoxical structure of the previous chapter’s chocolate laxative,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> tolerance coincides with its opposite. My duty to be tolerant towards the Other effectively means that I should not get too close </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">to him, intrude on his space. In other words, I should respect his intolerance of my over-proximity. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">What increasingly emerges as the central human right in late-capitalist society is the right not to be harassed, which is a right to remain at a safe distance from others. </span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;">political capital doesn’t influence the passage of legislation –presidential influence is exaggerated by the media </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Dickinson, 09</span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> – professor of political science at Middlebury College and taught previously at Harvard University where he worked under the supervision of presidential scholar Richard Neustadt (5/26/09, Matthew, Presidential Power: A NonPartisan Analysis of Presidential Politics, “Sotomayor, Obama and Presidential Power,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:6574:http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:6574 -->, JMP) </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 6.0pt;">As for Sotomayor, from here the path toward almost certain confirmation goes as follows: the Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hold hearings sometime this summer (this involves both written depositions and of course open hearings), which should lead to formal Senate approval before Congress adjourns for its summer recess in early August. So Sotomayor will likely take her seat in time for the start of the new Court session on October 5. (I talk briefly about the likely politics of the nomination process below). </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 6.0pt;">What is of more interest to me, however, is what her selection reveals about the basis of presidential power.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Political scientists, like baseball writers evaluating hitters, have devised numerous means of measuring a president’s influence in Congress. I will devote a separate post to discussing these, but in brief, they often center on the creation of legislative “box scores” designed to measure how many times a president’s preferred piece of legislation, or nominee to the executive branch or the courts, is approved by Congress. That is, how many pieces of legislation that the president supports actually pass Congress? How often do members of Congress vote with the president’s preferences? How often is a president’s policy position supported by roll call outcomes? These measures, however, are a misleading gauge of presidential power – they are a better indicator of congressional power. This is because how members of Congress vote on a nominee or legislative item is <strong>rarely influenced by anything a president does.</strong> Although journalists (and political scientists) often focus on the legislative “endgame” to gauge presidential influence – will the President swing enough votes to get his preferred legislation enacted? – <strong>this mistakes an outcome with actual evidence of presidential influence.</strong> Once we control for other factors – <strong>a member of Congress’ ideological and partisan leanings, the political leanings of her constituency, whether she’s up for reelection or not – we can usually predict how she will vote without needing to know much of anything about what the president wants.</strong> (I am ignoring the importance of a president’s veto power for the moment.) </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Despite the much publicized and celebrated instances of presidential arm-twisting during the legislative endgame, then, most legislative outcomes don’t depend on presidential lobbying. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 6.0pt;">But this is not to say that presidents lack influence. Instead, the primary means by which presidents influence what Congress does is through their ability to determine the alternatives from which Congress must choose. That is, presidential power is largely an exercise in agenda-setting – not arm-twisting. And we see this in the Sotomayer nomination. Barring a major scandal, she will almost certainly be confirmed to the Supreme Court whether Obama spends the confirmation hearings calling every Senator or instead spends the next few weeks ignoring the Senate debate in order to play Halo III on his Xbox. That is, how senators decide to vote on Sotomayor will have almost nothing to do with Obama’s lobbying from here on in (or lack thereof). His real influence has already occurred, in the decision to present Sotomayor as his nominee. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 6.0pt;">If we want to measure Obama’s “power”, then, we need to know what his real preference was and why he chose Sotomayor. My guess – and it is only a guess – is that after conferring with leading Democrats and Republicans, he recognized the overriding practical political advantages accruing from choosing an Hispanic woman, with left-leaning credentials. We cannot know if this would have been his ideal choice based on judicial philosophy alone, but presidents are never free to act on their ideal preferences. Politics is the art of the possible. Whether Sotomayer is his first choice or not, however, her nomination is a reminder that the power of the presidency often resides in the president’s ability to dictate the alternatives from which Congress (or in this case the Senate) must choose. Although Republicans will undoubtedly attack Sotomayor for her judicial “activism” (citing in particular her decisions regarding promotion and affirmative action), her comments regarding the importance of gender and ethnicity in influencing her decisions, and her views regarding whether appellate courts “make” policy, they run the risk of alienating Hispanic voters – an increasingly influential voting bloc (to the extent that one can view Hispanics as a voting bloc!) I find it very hard to believe she will not be easily confirmed. In structuring the alternative before the Senate in this manner, then, Obama reveals an important aspect of presidential power that cannot be measured through legislative boxscores. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">Second, the marriage efforts, like the efforts to end the military ban, have revealed just how vigorously conservative Americans will resist the efforts of gay people to join the institutions that they hold most dear. We have stepped on the sacred turf of the American right—at home, and at war. By the same token, the persistent efforts of gay men and lesbians to enter these essentially conservative institutions demonstrate the depth of our yearning for social acceptance. The marriage efforts are especially touching in this respect. Tens of thousands of gay people have joined together in ceremonies of their own devising, but most still crave to marry with the blessing of the state—less, it seems, for the legal benefits that might flow from it than for the symbolism of formal equality. The tenacity of the conservatives’ resistance is the measure of our need.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">But one small tent flap, it seems, remains battened down. Their New York convention made it clear that true Republicans want no part of gay or lesbian Americans -- not even the million or so who may have voted the GOP ticket last time. And suddenly, this element of the political spectrum is showing resentment. A homosexual bloc calling itself the Log Cabin Federation, having endured years of insult and abuse in return for its voter loyalty, has decided enough is enough. With only two dissenting voices, the federation's 25-member national board has withdrawn its endorsement of President Bush for re-election. Cause of the break, as obvious as it was avoidable, stems from a mean-spirited plank in the party platform -- a hostile statement reaching far beyond the president's call for a constitutional ban on gay marriage. Among other questionable assertions, the new platform declares homosexuality &quot;incompatible with military service.&quot; </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">While deserting Bush, the Log Cabin board emphasized it will put its money and other resources behind friendlier Republican candidates at the state and local level. Executive Director Patrick Guerriero explained the group's thinking thus: &quot;There is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party. That fight is bigger than one platform, one convention or even one president.&quot; One should not suppose that Bush's political guru, Karl Rove, is pacing the Rose Garden wondering how they lost the Log Cabin bunch, In its political scheming, this White House leaves little to chance. It's entirely likely that in snubbing the gay and lesbian movement, the platform committee was doing precisely what the president's campaign wanted. The Republican &quot;values base&quot; it cultivates so carefully remains a bastion of diehards who look to the Book of Leviticus for guidance on the mystery of sexual choice.</span><br />

Gay and Lesbian Writings in French, pp. 71-92 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cahun's reading of the trial also implicitly differentiates between the &quot;staging&quot; of male and female homosexuality. The trial renders Oscar Wilde's identity opaque because always staged or &quot;put on&quot;: Bill- ing tried to show, with his allusions to Wilde's love of performance and indirection, that homosexuality reveals itself, paradoxically, through its opacity. Billing's inability to produce the &quot;black book&quot; in the trial may then be easily read as a metaphor for the production of male homosexuality as an indecipherable identity. To the extent that Billing could not prove or produce the very thing he claimed was self-evident (the homosexuality of the entire English elite), he got himself into the bind Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick has defined as peculiar to homosexuality: it is &quot;minoritizing&quot; (specific to a defined subset of marked individuals) and &quot;universalizing&quot; (a tendency potentially in all individuals-at least since Freud).28 Thus, homosexuality is at once decipherable and impossible to decipher, since everyone is potentially gay. If everyone is potentially homosexual, the question at stake in the trial-who is really gay?-cannot be answered except tautologically by reference to everyone's potential homosexuality. But it is precisely this circularity, homosexuality's empty signification, that produces and subtends a paranoid cultural fantasy about the specter of contagious homosexuality: Billing was acquitted because the black book became an empty signifier onto which anxieties about the instability of social order could be projected. The absent black book served in the end to stabilize normative heterosexuality by standing in for an indecipherable and yet omnipresent threat against which righteous and moral men had to mobilize political and social energies. </span><br />

<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> The general rule is that a substantial pay reduction gives an employee good cause for quitting. Yet, there is no set percentage or bright-line rule that makes a reduction in pay &quot;substantial.&quot; The weight of authority, however, appears to be that a reduction of over 20 percent is so substantial as to compel an employee to quit a job and have good cause to do so, but a reduction of less than 20 percent is not.</span><br />

<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"> In reversing a summary judgment of invalidity, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that the district court, by failing to look beyond the intrinsic claim construction evidence to consider what a person of skill in the art would understand in a &quot;technologic context,&quot; erroneously concluded the term &quot;substantially&quot; made a claim fatally indefinite. Verve, LLC v. Crane Cams, Inc., Case No. 01-1417 (Fed. Cir. November 14, 2002). The patent in suit related to an improved push rod for an internal combustion engine. The patent claims a hollow push rod whose overall diameter is larger at the middle than at the ends and has &quot;substantially constant wall thickness&quot; throughout the rod and rounded seats at the tips. The district court found that the expression &quot;substantially constant wall thickness&quot; was not supported in the specification and prosecution history by a sufficiently clear definition of &quot;substantially&quot; and was, therefore, indefinite. The district court recognized that the use of the term &quot;substantially&quot; may be definite in some cases but ruled that in this case it was indefinite because it was not further defined. The Federal Circuit reversed, concluding that the district court erred in requiring that the meaning of the term &quot;substantially&quot; in a particular &quot;technologic context&quot; be found solely in intrinsic evidence: &quot;While reference to intrinsic evidence is primary in interpreting claims, the criterion is the meaning of words as they would be understood by persons in the field of the invention.&quot; Thus, the Federal Circuit instructed that &quot;resolution of any ambiguity arising from the claims and specification may be aided by extrinsic evidence of usage and meaning of a term in the context of the invention.&quot; The Federal Circuit remanded the case to the district court with instruction that &quot;[t]he question is not whether the word 'substantially' has a fixed meaning as applied to 'constant wall thickness,' but how the phrase would be understood by persons experienced in this field of mechanics, upon reading the patent documents.&quot;</span><br />

<strong>The [1AC/neg’s] engagement in green rhetoric throws the left a bone while legitimizing the state as a means to protect against threats</strong> <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jon Barnett</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Fellow in the School of Social and Environmental Enquiry at University of Melbourne, </span><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2001</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>The Meaning of Environmental Security: Ecological Politics and Policy in the New Security Era</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, pg. 87 p1 – pg. 88 p3) </span> The NSS, DOD and State Department interpret environmental security in a way that maintains the legitimacy of the US government in the face of pressing environmental problems. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">By deploying a green rhetoric the state makes enough of a token gesture to placate the concerns of the general public and to forestall a crisis of legitimacy</span>. This completely fails to engage with environmental problems themselves, for while envi­ronmental insecurity is a product of capitalism, militarism and industriali­sation, the approach of these agencies is to deploy ‘a complex repertoire of responsibility and crisis-displacement strategies</u></strong>’ (Hay 1994: 217). <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">T</span><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">he US approach to environmental security maintains legitimacy by</span>: a combination of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">symptom amelioration, token gesturism, </span>the ‘greening’ of legitimating political ideology, and the displacement of the crisis in a variety of different direction</u></strong>s: either downward into civil society; or upward onto a global political agenda: or, indeed, sideways in presenting the crisis as another body’s (e.g., state’s) legitimization problem. (Hay 1994: 221) <strong><u>Most of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">these tactics are evident in US environmental security policy discourse</span>. T</u></strong>he lethargic effort to clean up domestic contaminated bases but not those abroad is indicative of the ‘symptom amelioration’ tactic. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The ‘greening of political ideology’ is most clearly manifest in the envi­ronment</span>—<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">conflict discourse</span>, which is fundamentally <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">consistent with realist</span> international relations <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">theory</span>. There is little displacement down­wards into civil society, but the tactic of displacing problems up to the global level is clear</u></strong>, particularly in Christopher’s pronouncements. That this global rhetoric also opens up the possibility of the US as global manager and policeman further enhances the lure of this tactic. Finally, <strong><u>displacement sideways to present environmental degradation as someone else’s problem is also clearly apparent in the references to instability and political upheaval which intertwine with the environment—conflict discourse</u></strong>. <strong><u>For the US government, then, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">environmental security is used to preserve legitimacy, avoid radical reform and distract attention from</span> the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">contradictions of the modern world for which the US is inextricably responsible</span>.</u></strong> Hay calls <strong><u>such continued strategies of displacement ‘dysfunc­tional long-term tendencies’ which in this case make the United States ‘a profound threat to global security’ (</u></strong>Hay 1994: 227). <strong><u>All of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">these approaches to environmental security interpret the environment as a</span> direct or indirect <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">threat to US</span> interests. Talking in terms of threats in this way confuses environmental problems with military problems. This is an inappropriate way to understand environ­mental problems</u></strong>, particularly given that ‘threat’ in security discourse is <strong><u>a potent symbol of deliberate and malignant danger to the inside emanating from the outside. In this respect the environment becomes another danger which helps constitute the sense of Us necessary for the popular acceptance of the nation-state</u></strong>. <strong><u>Talking in terms of global threats helps to blur the distinctions between subject and object, and cause and effect, and this obscures US complicity in environmental degradatio</u></strong>n. This environ­mental security policy discourse evades the most salient point about national security and environmental degradation: that <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the country most complicit in ‘global’ environmental degradation is the U</span>nited <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">S</span>tates itself. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Talking in terms of threats is thus a discursive tactic that simultane­ously downgrades the interdependence of environmental problems</span></u></strong> whilst <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">excluding</span></u> from consideration the role of US businesses, consumers and government in generating environmental problems.

This produces a new boundary that demarcates the ‘East’ from the ‘West’…. But environmental danger can also be figured in a manner that challenges traditional forms of identity inscribed in the capitalist economy of the ‘West’. As a discourse of danger which results in disciplinary strategies that are deterritorialized, involve communal co-operation, and refigure economic relationships, <strong><u>the environ­ment can serve to enframe a different reading of ‘reasoning man’ than that associated with the subjectivities of liberal</u></strong> <u>capitalism<strong>, thereby making it more unstable and undecidable than anticommunism.</strong></u> (Campbell 1992: 197) <span class="underline">It is precisely these implications, of deterritorialization, communal co‑operation and refiguring economies that threaten the US security elite, and so are denied and excluded in their environmental security pronouncements. </span> <strong>Reps of environmental apocalypse enable authoritarianism -- also hurts the same environmental movements they purport to help</strong> <strong>Buell 2003 –</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Professor of English @ Cornell (Fredrick, From Apocalypse to Way of Life. p. 200-2) Elaborating crisis is thus not ... ties to clearly terminal “nature.” </span><br />

 <strong>The aff’s militarization of space causes endless wars against alterity – US citizens are mobilized as soldiers against threats</strong> <strong>Orr 4 –</strong> Professor of Sociology and Syracuse (Jackie, The Militarization of Inner Space, Critical Sociology, Sage Journals) CMR <span style="font-size: 7pt;">“[</span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">E]very American is a soldier</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">” now, declared George W. Bush one month after September 11, 2001. 2 Speaking at the first meeting of the new Homeland Security Council, whose opening order of business was to beef up U.S. border operations by tightening immigration surveillance and control, Mr. Bush’s pronouncement itself performed a consequential border crossing. His sweeping rhetorical induction of the entire U.S. citizenry into the ranks of military combatants obliterated the very boundary between ‘civilian’ and ‘soldier’ on which popular understandings of ‘terrorism’ fundamentally depend: would future attacks on U.S. civilians now be acknowledged as a targeted assault on U.S. soldiers? Mr. Bush’s border transgression, conducted in the midst and in the name of intensified border patrols, raises a few other urgent questions for the </span>newly anointed civiliansoldier: When was I trained for battle? What are my weapons and how do they work? And where, precisely, stands this “home” which the new armies of civilians are asked to secure? Which borders are we really being asked to defend? <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">What exactly is this war into which the U.S. civilian-soldier has been involuntarily drafted?</span> The ‘war against terrorism’ is the repetitiously proffered answer to this last query. But a little bit of history and the website of the U.S. Space Command suggest another story. <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">The U.S. Space Command was established in 1985 as the coordinating military body unifying Army, Navy, and Air Force activities in outer space</span>. “As stewards for military space,” states General Howell M. Estes III, the Space Command’s ex-Commander in Chief, “<span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">we must be prepared to exploit the advantages of the space medium</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.” In </span><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Joint Vision 2010</span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, an operational plan for securing and maintaining unchallengeable “space power,” the U.S. Space Command describes how “the medium of space is the fourth medium of warfare – along with land, sea, and air.” </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">The end result</span> of the “emerging synergy of space superiority with land, sea, and air superiority” <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">is the achievement of Full Spectrum Dominance: the capacity of the U.S. military to dominate in any conflict</span>, waged in any terrestrial<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> or extraterrestrial medium. Or, in the Space Command’s words, displayed onscreen against the black, starstudded. background of empty space: “U.S. Space Command – dominating the space dimension of military operations to protect U.S. interests and investment. Integrating Space Forces into warfighting capabilities across the full spectrum of conflict.” 3 </span> <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">The battles</span> for which the U.S. Space Command is prepared <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">are not futuristic science fiction scenarios</span>. As the command center responsible for the protection and proliferation of military and commercial satellites, and for the rejuvenated National Missile Defense program, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the</span> Space <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Command is</span> already <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">a key player in the conduct of U.S. war</span>. <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Satellitemediated infotech warfare has arrived</span>. The militarized use of space-based satellites to provide real-time flows of information and imagery debuted in the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989, developed in the 1990s during the U.S.-led war against Iraq and in the killing fields of Kosovo, and is today an integral<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> component of U.S. military activity in Afghanistan and Iraq (Gray 1997; Grossman 2001). “Space support to NATO’s operations in Kosovo was a perfect example of how the United States will fight its wars in the future,” the Space Command reported in 2002, “Satelliteguided munitions, communications, navigation, and weather all combined to achieve military objectives in a relatively short amount of time and without the loss of a single U.S. troop.” 4 As home to an increasingly sophisticated and expensive infrastructure of satellites, and to a proposed network of (possibly nuclear-powered) space stations equipped with laser weaponry, ‘outer space’ is now the final, fantastic frontier for the U.S. military’s imaginary and material battlefields. With Full Spectrum Dominance as its official doctrine, the U.S. Space Command clearly articulates its 21st century mission: to ensure that the United States will remain a global power and exert global leadership during the current “globalization of the world economy.” Noting with admirable sociological acumen that this globalization will create a “widening between ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’ </span><br />
<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. . . </span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">[and] [t]his gap will widen – creating regional unrest,” the U.S. Space Command announces that the new strategic situation requires “a global perspective to conduct military operations and support regional warfighting</span><em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. . .</span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">” 5 The U.S. Space Command stands ready to serve.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">And we – we civilian-soldiers – where do </span>we stand? <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">In what space</span> really <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">do we wage our</span> scrambled <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">warfare</span>, our civilian participation in the militarized state of the nation? Are we all soldiers now in the battle for Full Spectrum Dominance of the globe? South Asia. Eurasia. East Asia. Central Asia. What boot camp has prepared us for the rigors of a <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">perpetually ambiguous</span>, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">infinitely expanding battlefield</span>? Across what geography is the ‘war against terrorism’ really mapped? <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Land. Sea. Air. Space</span>. In <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">how many dimensions must today’s civilian-soldier really move</span>? <span style="font-size: 7pt;">The Bush administration’s first National Security Strategy document, published in September 2002, offers the inquiring civilian-soldier some indication of the full scope of the battle plans. Twelve months after launching its boundless war against terrorism, the administration introduced its new doctrine of preemptive strikes, unilaterally pursued, against perceived threats. National security now depends, the civilian-soldier learns, on “identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders</span><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. . . </span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">[W]e will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting preemptively.” 6 Released just as the Bush administration stepped up its rhetorical and operational preparations for a military invasion and occupation of Iraq, the document leads even mainstream media commentators to note, with measured alarm, its imperial posture. An editorial published in </span><em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution </span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">a week after the document is made public describes it as a “plan for permanent U.S. military and economic domination of every region on the globe.” The editorial warns: “This war [against Iraq], should it come, is intended to mark the official </span>emergence of the United States as a full-fledged global empire, seizing sole responsibility and authority as planetary policemen.” 7 If the militarization of outer space is an essential component of Full Spectrum Dominance, and if the so-called ‘war against terrorism’ must be situated within broader U.S. ambitions for global empire, 8 it is perhaps useful for today’s civilian-soldier to wonder just <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">how</span> wide and <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">deep is</span> a “full <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">spectrum” of dominance</span>? <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">What borders must be crossed to</span> fully <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">dominate such an infinity of space</span>? Perhaps the domination of outer space in the interests of militarized technologies and intelligence requires the militarization of a somewhat more <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">covert spatial territory – a territory more spectral, less smoothly operationalized but no less necessary to global dominion</span>. What happens in that elusive terrain of ‘inner space’ as outer space becomes an overt field for fully militarized command posts? Is the ‘inner’ psychic terrain of today’s U.S. civilian-soldier another battlefield on the way to full spectrum dominance of the globe? <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">What</span> kind of <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">militarized infrastructure is needed ‘inside’ the soldierly civilian </span>called upon <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">to</span> support the <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">establish</span>ment of <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">military superiority across</span> the spectrum of <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">spaces ‘outside’</span>? <span style="font-size: 7pt;">To what extent might Full Spectrum Dominance depend intimately on commanding ‘space power’ in both outer and inner space? The psychology of the civilian-soldier, the networks of everyday emotional and perceptual relations, constitute an ‘inner space’ that is today, I suggest, one volatile site of attempted military occupation. But the occupying forces I’m concerned with here are not those of an invasive, enemy ‘other.’ Rather, a partial and urgent history of attempts by the U.S. government, media, military, and academy to enlist the psychological life of U.S. citizens as a military asset – this is the embodied story that occupies me here. The </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">militarization of inner space</span>, a complex, discontinuous story that nowhere <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">crystallizes</span> into <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the</span> clear <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">knot of conspiracy</span> but <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">which leaves</span> its <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">uneven traces throughout</span> the scattered archives of <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the</span> 20th century <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">U</span>nited <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">S</span>tates, is now as it has been before a major concern of those most responsible for the business of war. <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Militarization</span>, defined by historian Michael Geyer as “<span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> contradictory and tense social </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">process in which</span> civil <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">society organizes itself for the production of violence</span>,” <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">constitutes</span> at its core <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">a border-crossing between military and civilian institutions, activitie</span>s and aims (1989: 79). The <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">militarization of inner space can be conceived, then, as the </span><br />
<br />
<em><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">psychological organization of civil society for the production of violence</span></em><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">, </span>an important feature of a broader – tense and contradictory – social process. It is not my intention to reify ‘psychology’ or psychological processes as if they could be separated from social, historical, or economic contexts. Quite the contrary. By naming<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the constructed ‘inner space’ of psychological activities as increasingly militarized – with the events of September 11 serving as an accelerator and intensifier of processes that are by no means new – my hope is to deepen a critical sociological commitment to contesting the ‘space’ of psychology as the radically social matter of political struggle, as one radically material weapon of war. Or its refusal. While I refer to this psychological space as ‘inner,’ it of course is not irreducibly individual, and is never confined to a neat interiority. Inner space both produces and is produced by deeply social ways of seeing, profoundly cultural technologies of perception. And though I want to reject any notion of a homogeneous collective psyche, I do want to conjure the dense sociality and historicity of psychology spaces. Psychological life occupies a difficult borderland, a ‘between-space’ where the question and human confusions of what is ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ are repetitiously experienced, and consciously and unconsciously lived. Indeed, the space of psychology is the very site where everyday sensations of what’s ‘inside’ and what’s ‘outside,’ what’s ‘them’ and what’s ‘us,’ what feels safe and what seems fatally frightening are culturally (re)produced or resisted; it is an intensely border-conscious space. The politics of borders – how they’re made and unmade, what they come to mean – is one shifting center of the politics of nationalism, of language, of memory, of race, gender, class, of terror. What has come in the modern West to be called the ‘psychological’ plays a dramatic, power-charged role within each of these entangled political fields. The militarization of psychological space can be imagined then as a </span><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">strategic set of psychological border operations </span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">aimed at the organization of civil society for the production of violence. </span><br />

 <strong>Fear of chinese modernization is motivated by ethnocentric drives for power</strong> <strong>Macdonald 7 –</strong> Professor of Human Geography at the University of Melbourne (Fraser, Anti-Astropolitik: Outer Space and the Orbit of Geography, Online) CMR <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Two </span>things should now be clear. First, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">outer space is no longer remote from our everyday lives</span>; <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">it is</span> already profoundly <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">implicated in the</span> ordinary <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">workings of</span> economy and <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">society</span>. Secondly, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the import of space to civilian</span>, commercial and, in particular, military <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">objectives</span>, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">means there is a great deal at stake</span> in terms of the access to and control over Earth’s orbit. One cannot overstate this last point. The next few years may prove decisive in terms of establishing a regime of space control that will have profound implications for terrestrial geopolitics. It is in this context that I want to briefly introduce the emerging field of <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">astropolitics</span>, defined as ‘the study of the relationship between outer space terrain and technology and the development of political and military policy and strategy’ (Dolman, 2002: 15). It is, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">in</span> both theory and <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">practice, a geopolitics of outer space</span>. Everett Dolman is one of the pioneers of the field. An ex-CIA intelligence analyst who teaches at the US Air Force’s School of Advanced Airpower Studies, he publishes in journals that are perhaps unfamiliar to critical geographers, like the modestly titled <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Small <span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Wars and Insurgencies</span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As what follows is uniformly critical of Dolman’s work, I should say that his </span><em>Astropolitik: classical geopolitics in the space age</em> (Dolman, 2002) is unquestionably a significant book: it has defined a now vibrant field of research and debate. <em>Astropolitik</em> draws together a vast literature on space exploration and space policy, and presents a lucid and accessible introduction to thinking strategically about space. (In the previous section I drew heavily on Dolman’s description of the astropolitical environment). My critique is not founded on scientific or technical grounds but on Dolman’s construction of a formal geopolitics designed to advance and legitimate the unilateral military conquest of space by the United States. While Dolman has many admirers among neoconservative colleagues in Washington think-tanks, critical engagements (e.g. Moore, 2003; Caracciolo, 2004) have been relatively thin on the ground.<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Dolman’s work is interesting for our purposes here precisely because he draw’s on geography’s back catalogue of strategic thinkers, most prominently Halford Mackinder, whose ideas gained particular prominence in America in the wake of 28 the Russian </span><br />
<br />
<em>Sputnik</em> (Hooson, 2004: 377). But Dolman is not just re-fashioning classical geopolitics in the new garb of ‘astropolitics’; he goes further and proposes an ‘<em>Astropolitik’ –</em> ‘a simple but effective blueprint for space control’ (p. 9) – modeled on Karl Hausofer’s <em>Geopolitik</em> as much as <em>Realpolitik</em>. Showing some discomfort with the impeccably fascist pedigree of this theory, Dolman cautions against the ‘misuse’ of <em>Astropolitik</em> and argues that the term ‘is chosen as a constant reminder of that past, and as a grim warning for the future’ (Dolman, 2002: 3). At the same time, however, his book is basically a manual for achieving space dominance. Projecting Mackinder’s famous thesis on the geographical pivot of history (Mackinder, 1904) onto outer space, Dolman argues that ‘who controls the Lower Earth Orbit controls near-Earth space. Who controls near-Earth space dominates Terra [Earth]. Who dominates Terra determines the destiny of humankind’. Dolman sees the quest for space as already having followed classically Mackinderian principles (Dolman, 2002: 87). And like Mackinder before him, Dolman is writing in the service of his Empire. ‘<em>Astropolitik</em> like <em>Realpolitik’</em> he writes, ‘is hardnosed and pragmatic, it is not pretty or uplifting or a joyous sermon for the masses. But neither is it evil. Its benevolence or malevolence become apparent only as it is applied, and by whom’ (Dolman, 2002: 4). Further inspiration is drawn from Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose classic volume <em>The Influence of Seapower Upon History</em>, has been widely cited by space strategists (Mahan, 1890; Gray, 1996; see also Russell, 2006). Mahan’s discussion of the strategic value of coasts, harbours, well–worn sea paths and chokepoints has its parallel in outer space (see France, 2000). The implication of Mahan’s work, Dolman concludes, is that ‘the United States must be ready and prepared, in Mahanian scrutiny, to commit to the defense and maintenance of these assets, or relinquish them to a state willing and able to do so’ (Dolman, 2002: 37).<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The primary problem for those advancing </span><em>Astropolitik</em> is that space is not a lawless frontier. In fact the legal character of space has long been enshrined in the principles of the OST and this has, to some extent, prevented it from being subject to unbridled interstate competition. ‘While it is morally desirable to<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">29 of the OST as ‘a tragedy’ that has removed any legal incentive for the exploitation of space (137). Only a </span><br />
<em>res nullius</em>explore space in common with all peoples’ writes Dolman without conviction, ‘even the thought of doing so makes weary those who have the means’ (Dolman, 2002: 135). Thus, the veneer of transcendent humanism with regard to space gives way to brazen self-interest. Accordingly, Dolman describes the <em>res communis</em> consensus<span style="position: relative; top: -4pt;">7 </span><em>8</em> legal order could construct space as ‘proper objects for which states may compete’ (138). Under the paradigm of <em>res nullius</em> and <em>Astropolitik,</em> the moon and other celestial bodies would become potential new territory for states. And here Dolman again parallels Karl Hausofer’s Geopolitik. Just as Hausofer desired a break from the Versailles Treaty (Ó Tuathail 1996: 45), Dolman wants to see the US withdraw from the OST, making full speed ahead for the Moon (see also Hickman and Dolman, 2002). Non-space-faring developing countries need not worry about losing out, says Dolman, as they ‘would own no less of the Moon than they do now’ (140).<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">To his credit, Dolman does give some attention to the divisive social consequences of this concentrated power. Drawing on earlier currents of environmental determinism and on the terrestrial model of Antarctic exploration, he ponders the characteristics of those who will be first to colonise space. They will be ‘highly educated, rigorously trained and psychologically screened for mental toughness and decision-making skills, and very physically fit’; ‘the best and brightest of our pilots, technicians and scientists’; ‘rational, given to scientific analysis and explanation, and obsessed with their professions’ (26). In other words, ‘they are a superior subset of the larger group from which they spring’ (27). As if this picture isn’t vivid enough, Dolman goes on to say that colonizers of space ‘</span><em>will be the most capably endowed</em> (or at least the most ruthlessly suitable, as the populating of America and Australia … so aptly illustrate[s])’ (27; my emphasis). ‘Duty and sacrifice will be the highest moral ideals’ (27). Society, he continues, must be prepared ‘to make heroes’ of those who undertake the risk of exploration (146). At the same time, ‘the astropolitical society must be prepared to forego expenditures on social programs … to channel funds into the national space program. It must be embued with the national spirit’ (146).<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">30 Dolman slips from presenting what would be merely a ‘logical’ outworking of </span><br />
<em>Astropolitik,</em> to advocating that the United States adopt it as their space strategy. Along the way, he acknowledges the full anti-democratic potential of such concentrated power, detaching the state from its citizenry:<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">‘the United States can adopt any policy it wishes and the attitudes and reactions of the domestic public and of other states can do little to challenge it. So powerful is the United States that should it accept the harsh </span><em>Realpolitik</em> doctrine in space that the military services appear to be proposing, and given a proper explanation for employing it, there may in fact be little if any opposition to a <em>fait accompli</em> of total US domination in space’. 156.<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Although Dolman claims that ‘no attempt will be made to create a convincing argument that the United States has a right to domination in space’, in almost the next sentence he goes on to argue ‘that, in this case, </span><em>might does make right</em>’, ‘the persuasiveness of the case’ being ‘based on the self-interest of the state and stability of the system’ (156; my emphasis). Truly, this is <em>Astropolitik</em>: a veneration of the ineluctable logic of power and the permanent rightness of those who wield it. And if it sounds chillingly familiar, Dolman hopes to reassure us with his belief that ‘the US form of liberal democracy … is admirable and socially encompassing’ (156) and it is ‘the most benign state that has ever attempted hegemony over the greater part of the world’ (158). His sunny view that the United States is ‘willing to extend legal and political equality to all’ sits awkwardly with the current suspension of the rule of law in Guantanamo Bay as well as in various other ‘spaces of exception’ (see Gregory, 2004; Agamben, 2005).<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Dolman’s astropolitical project is by no means exceptional. The journal </span><em>Astropolitics,</em> of which he is a founding editor, contains numerous papers expressing similar views. And it is easy, I think, for critical geographers to feel so secure in the intellectual and political purchase of Ó Tuathailian critiques (Ó Tuathail, 1996), that we become oblivious to the undead nature of classical geopolitics. It is comforting to think that most geography undergraduates encountering geopolitics, in the UK at least, will in all likelihood do so through<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">31 the portal of critical perspectives, perhaps through the excellent work of Joanne Sharp or Klaus Dodds (Dodds, 2005; Sharp, 2005). But the legacies of Mackinder and Mahan live on, and radical critique is as urgent as ever. While this is not the place for a thoroughgoing reappraisal of astropolitics in the manner of Gearòid Ó Tuathail, a few salient points from his critique can be brought out. </span> 1. <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Astrography and astropolitics</span>, like geography and geopolitics, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">constitute</span> ‘a <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">political domination</span> and cultural imagining <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">of space’</span> (Ó Tuathail, 1996: 28). While commentators like Colin Gray have posited an ‘inescapable geography’ (e.g. ‘of course, physical geography is politically neutral’), <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">a critical agenda conceives of geography not as a fixed sub</span>stratum but as <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">a</span> highly <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">social form of knowledge</span> (Gray, 1999: 173; Ó Tuathail, 1999: 109). For geography, read ‘astrography’. We must be alert to the ‘declarative’ (‘this is how the Outer Earth is’) and ‘imperative’ (‘this is what we must do’) modes of narration<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> that astropolitics has borrowed from its terrestrial antecedent (Ó Tuathail, 1999: 107). The models of Mackinder and Mahan that are so often applied to the space environment are not unchanging laws; on the contrary they are themselves highly political attempts to create and sustain particular strategic outcomes in specific historical circumstances. 2. </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Rather than </span>actively <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">supporting</span> the dominant structures and <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">mechanisms of power, a critical astropolitics must place the primacy of such forces always already in question</span>. Critical astropolitics <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">aims to scrutinise</span> the <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">power politics of the expert/think-tank/tactician</span> as part of a wider project of deepening public debate and strengthening democratic accountability (Ó Tuathail, 1999: 108). 3. <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Mackinder’s ‘end of geography’ thesis held that the era of terrestrial exploration and discovery was over, leaving only the task of consolidating the world order to fit British interests</span> (O’ Tuathail<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, 1996: 27). Dolman’s vision of space strategy bears striking similarities. And like Ó Tuathail’s critique of Mackinder’s imperial hubris, </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Astropolitik</em> could be reasonably described as ‘triumphalism blind to its own precariousness’ (O’ Tuathail, 1996: 28). Dolman, for instance, makes little effort to conceal his tumescent patriotism, observing that ‘the United States is awash with<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">power after its impressive victories in the 1991 Gulf War and 1999 Kosovo campaign, and stands at the forefront of history capable of presiding over the birth of a bold New World Order’. One might argue, however, that Mackinder – as the theorist of imperial decline – may in this respect be an appropriate mentor (Ó Tuathail, 1999: 112). It is important, I think, to demystify </span><em>Astropolitik</em>: there is nothing ‘inevitable’ about US dominance in space, even if the US were to pursue this imperial logic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">4. Again </span> like Mackinder, <br />
<em><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Astropolitik </span></em><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">mobilizes an unquestioned ethnocentrism. Implicit in this ideology is the notion that America must beat China into space because ‘they’ are not like ‘us’. ‘The most ruthlessly suitable’ candidates for space dominance, we are told – ‘the most capably endowed’ – are like those who populated America and Australia</span> (Dolman, 2002: 27). 5. A critical astropolitics must challenge the ‘<span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">mythic’ properties of </span><br />
<em>Astropolitik</em> and disrupt its reverie for the ‘timeless insights’ of the so-called geopolitical masters. For Ó Tuathail, ‘geopolitics is mythic because it promises uncanny clarity … in a complex world’ and is ‘fetishistically concerned with …. prophecy’ (Ó Tuathail, 1999: 113). Ó Tuathail’s critical project, by contrast, seeks to recover the political and historical contexts through which the knowledge of Mackinder and Mahan has become formalized.<br />

 <strong>Aff reproduces terror – ignoring the social and historical context for terrorism imposes a Western ideology creating a rallying point for terrorists and skewing our predictions for how terrorists will act</strong> <strong>Zulaika</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 20</span><strong>09</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Joesba, Professor, at the Center for Basque Studies. Ph.D., Anthropology, from Princeton University, has written widely on the issue of Terrorism and culture. “Terrorism: The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy” 2009, p. 1-3, MT)</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Counterterrorism has become self-fulfilling and </span>it <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is now pivotal in promoting terrorism</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This book is an attempt to prove it. There is now near consensus, on both the Left and the Right, that the war in Iraq has been a catastrophe and that the War on Terror has made the United States far less secure than before. Yet we barely understand the thinking that, with the generalized approval of the public, led us to this situation. Why the sense of missed opportunities and failure of George W. Bush’s presidency? A response requires understanding the role of counterterrorism in designing public policy. In order to think and write terrorism without thereby further constituting it, the preliminary task at hand is conceptual: What are the impasses and blind spots in counterterrorist thinking that led us to the self-fulfilling nature of the War on Terror? The first part of the book is devoted to the ways in which discourse creates and perpetuates the very thing it abominates. It repeats the call in my book Terror and Taboo (coauthored with William Douglass) for an exorcism against such culture—“Terrorism discourse must be disenchanted if it is to lose its efficacy for all concerned,”1 terrorists and counterterrorists alike. I fully agree with Richard Jackson’s conclusion that </span><u>“</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">resisting the discourse is not an act of disloyalty; it is an act of political self-determination; and it is absolutely necessary if we are to avoid another stupefying period of fear and violence like the cold war.”2 There is little doubt by now that terrorism discourse creates its own reality. My arguments here go beyond discourse analysis. Terrorism is premised on the will of insurgents, rebels, fighters, terrorists. Terrorism studies are about tactics, financial networks, organizational structures, ideologies, psychological types—the observable expressions of the terrorist agenda. But first we must reckon with the terrorist as an individual subject. We are baffled by his or her seeming madness, the horrific freedom of his amor fati, the willing acceptance of death and killing as one’s mission, the embrace of a truth that can only be expressed in the form of terroristic massacre. And it is a madness that is all the more disconcerting because we know it is strategically willed and aimed directly at us for reasons that we cannot clearly see nor accept. These issues cannot be properly addressed without the awareness that the terrorist subject is deeply engaged in the politics of the unconscious, including the Freudian “death drive” expressed in willfully embracing suicide. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Counterterrorism’s ignorance of the languages, cultures, and histories of the people it purports to monitor is proverbial. The crisis of knowledge begins with the quality of the intelligence when the analysts are not able to look into their own ideological investments</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> What is one to make of the fact that scores of people in the intelligence community had known for months that two of the people who were going to take part in 9/11 were living in the United States, yet nothing was done about it? According to the findings of the 9/11 Commission (officially, the National Commission on Terrorists Attacks upon the United States), “evidence gathered by the panel showed that the attacks could probably have been prevented.”3 Why such blindness? What needs to be established is that the system had sufficient evidence to know about the upcoming plot yet it preferred not to know that it knew</span><u>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">These</span> are <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">problems</span> that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">derive</span> directly <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">from</span> a <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">faulty epistemology</span>—<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">beginning with </span>the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">placement of the entire phenomenon in</span> a <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">context of taboo and the willful ignorance of the political subjectivities of the terrorists</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>They have to do with <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">what counts as a standard of evidence</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">what is valuable information, what type of experience should be respected, what sort of associative logic links together various kinds of events, and other various contexts and mind-sets</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> One only has to compare Paul Bremer’s and David Petraeus’s policies in Iraq to become aware of the disastrous self-generating logic of counterterrorism. The counterterrorist Bremer acted as if anything touched by Saddam Hussein was contaminated with evil and drove tens of thousands of former soldiers and officers into the insurgency; the military man Petraeus studied the culture and ended up negotiating with and partially dissolving the enemy. The counterterrorist is typically like the proverbial dumb policeman who, by ignoring the actor’s subjectivity in its complex interaction of cultural background, social motivation, and unconscious desire, is unable to read the evidence in front of his eyes while taking seriously “evidence” deliberately planted by the criminal to fool him. What is required is to make the sweeping change from the policeman’s to the detective’s mind frame. We went to war against Hussein because we did not figure out that he was bluffing. What kind of writing can do justice to the terrorists’ suicidal madness? Since at least the Old Testament, writers have dealt with murder; far from utterly alien human beings, murderers have been depicted by writers as all-too-human members of ordinary communities; at times heroicized, at other times their actions are deplored as tragic, they are always the objects of intense curiosity and study. Before he wrote his “nonfiction novel” In Cold Blood, Truman Capote spent hundreds of hours with the multiple murderers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. They became for him anything but tabooed people. In fact, he projected himself into Perry’s life and concluded that he was too much like himself. The final result is that Capote knew his murderers thoroughly and intimately — they could not lie to him, nor would he underestimate their human potential. Counterterrorism thinking precludes in principle the subjective knowledge of a Truman Capote or a detective or an ethnographer. Hence, I argue in this book, the categorical blunders and the systemic blindness.</span> <strong>Claiming to “solve” terrorism through shifts in military action misses the point – postulating that they are intrinsically evil means we should annihilate them forces wars of intervention – only reevaluating terror solves</strong> <strong>Noorani 2005 --</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Assistant Professor in Near Eastern Studies at the University of Arizona (Yaseen, “The Rhetoric of Security.” </span><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The New Centennial Review</span></em> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">5.1 (2005) 13-41, Project MUSE) CMR The Bush administration perpetually affirms that the war against terrorism declared in response to the attacks of September 2001 is &quot;different from any other war in our history&quot; and will continue &quot;for the foreseeable future.&quot;1 This affirmation, and indeed the very declaration of such a war, belongs to a rhetoric of security that predates the Bush administration and which this administration has intensified but not fundamentally altered. Rhetorically speaking, </span>terrorism is the ideal enemy of the United States<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, more so than any alien civilization and perhaps </span>even more so than the tyrannies of communism and fascism, terrorism's defeated sisters<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is because </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">terrorism is depicted in U.S. rhetoric</span> not as an immoral tactic employed in political struggle, but <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">as an immoral condition that extinguishes the possibility of peaceful political deliberation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>This condition is the state of war, in absolute moral opposition to the peaceful condition of civil society<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As a state of war, terrorism </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">portends the dissolution of the civil relations obtaining within and among nations,</span> particularly liberal nations, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">and thus portends the dissolution of civilization itself</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span> <strong>[End Page 13]</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Terrorism is therefore </span>outside the world order, in the sense that it cannot be managed within this order since it is the very absence of civil order. <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">For there to be a world order at all, terrorism must be eradicated.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In prosecuting a world war against the state of war, the United States puts itself outside the world order as well. The Bush administration affirms, like the Clinton administration before it, that because the identity of the United States lies in the values that engender peace (freedom and democracy), the national interests of the United States always coincide with the interests of the world order. </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">The United States is the animus of the world order </span>and the power that sustains it. <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">For this reason</span>, any threat to the existence of the United States is a threat to world peace itself, and <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">anything that the United States does to secure its existence is justified as necessary for the preservation of world peace</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this way, the existence of the United States stands at the center of world peace and liberal values, yet remains outside the purview of these values, since when under threat it is subject only to the extra-moral necessity of self-preservation. I will argue that </span>the symmetrical externality of the United States and terrorism to the world order lies at the foundation of the rhetoric of security by which the U.S. government justifies its hegemonic actions and policies.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This rhetoric depicts a world in which </span>helpless, vulnerable citizens can achieve agency only through the U.S. government, while terrorist individuals and organizations command magnitudes of destructive power previously held only by states<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The moral-psychological discourse of agency and fear, freedom and enslavement invoked by this rhetoric is rooted in both classical liberalism and postwar U.S. foreign policy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">The war of &quot;freedom&quot; against &quot;fear&quot; is a psychic struggle with no specific military enemies or objectives</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">arises from the portrayal of the U</span>nited <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">S</span>tates <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">as an</span> autarkic, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">ideally impermeable collective agent that reshapes the external world in its own image</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The war of freedom against fear thereby justifies measures said to increase the defenses and internal security of the United States as well as measures said to spread freedom and democracy over the world. </span>Now that the destructive capacity of warlike individuals can threaten the world order, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the power of the United States must be deployed in equal measure to neutralize this threat throughout the world</span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The world <span style="font-size: 8pt;">as a</span> <strong>[End Page 14]</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">whole now </span>comes within the purview of U.S. disciplinary action. Any<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> manifestation of the state of war, </span>terrorist activity, anywhere in the world, is now a threat to the existence of the United States and to world peace<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>There is no &quot;clash of civilizations,&quot; but the Middle East, as the current site of the state of war, is the primary danger to the world and must be contained, controlled, and reshaped<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The symmetrical externality of the United States and terrorism to the world order, then, allows its rhetoric to envision a historic opportunity for mankind—the final elimination of the state of war from human existence, and fear from the political psyche. This will be achieved, however, only by incorporating the world order into the United States for the foreseeable future. </span> <strong>Using military force against terrorist groups is counterproductive- just forces groups underground and encourages innovation</strong> Audrey <strong>Cronin</strong>, Assistant Professor @ Georgetown, June 20<strong>02</strong> “Rethinking Sovereignty: American Strategy in the Age of Terrorism”, Survival, 44:2 In more practical terms, however, the use of military force has become more difficult because of evolutions in the threat. <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Terrorist groups are</span> increasingly <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">amorphous</span>, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">more likely to use evolving information technologies and to rely less upon traditional organisational structures</span>, thus making it much harder to find targets to attack militarily. Sometimes perpetrators come together temporarily only for the purpose of attacking a target, as was the case in the first World Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City attack. The dispersal of al-Qaeda before the US bombing, for example, shows the difficulty of identifying and tracking down leaders of terror. Changes in the motivations of terrorists have also complicated the picture for the use of military force<strong>, since</strong> <strong>potential <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">supporters of</span> fanatical <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">religious groups</span> are more likely to <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">see military</span></strong> <strong><span style="background-color: yellow; backgroundclip: initial; backgroundorigin: initial;">attacks as further confirmation of their absolutist view of the world.</span></strong> <strong><span style="background-color: yellow; backgroundclip: initial; backgroundorigin: initial;">If the terrorists are militarily destroyed, the legitimacy of their cause may</span></strong> <strong><span style="background-color: yellow; backgroundclip: initial; backgroundorigin: initial;">still exist and even become stronger, depending on how the operation is</span></strong> <strong><span style="background-color: yellow; backgroundclip: initial; backgroundorigin: initial;">perceived</span></strong><strong>.</strong> Dramatic cruise missile attacks, for example, play into the mindsets of developing countries (and even of some US allies) affirming the belief that the US is too powerful, takes too many unilateral actions and has too much sway in the world. The ironic result is an overall increase in political sympathy for the terrorists or their cause<strong>. The <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">history</span> of the use of military force against</strong> <strong>terrorist organisations <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">is not encouraging: military responses</span>, while disruptive</strong> <strong>in the short run, tend to <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">drive terrorists underground</span>, to <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">encourage innovation</span>,</strong> <strong>to <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">engender sympathy</span> and, sometimes, even <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">build support for the ‘underdog’</span></strong>. <br />

The news is hyped, through a combination of simplification with exaggeration, to keep the <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">attention</span> of those bored <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">by overexposure to a synthetic plenitude</span> of the <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">best and worst of everything</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, till the next ad break, with this rhythm repeated so many thousands of times that it becomes the eternal cycle of postmodern Western consciousness. </span>As Barnett’s book abundantly shows, contemporary Americentrism ‘‘knows’’ the world only through myths made in the market<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, under the pressures of the domination of the object over the subject. However, </span>the terrible events of September 11,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> an attack on the economic and political centers of American power, </span>turned collective delusion into collective derangement. Now we have a geo-centrism that wants to protect itself by forcing the world’s peoples to become our cultural mimics<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (we are ‘‘connectivity personified’’). </span>The world will be made safe for Americans,<strong><span style="background-color: yellow; backgroundclip: initial; backgroundorigin: initial;"> by making the world American</span></strong><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">.</span> Instead of trying to understand the cultures of the world’s peoples, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">America commits to obliterating them</span>. So it is too that a good man, Thomas P M Barnett, who comes to save the world, does his bit to destroy any potential there might still be for a lasting peace. That peace can come only from cultural appreciation, whereas what we have here, from the neoliberal end of the now neo-conservative military–ideological complex, is a symptom of the will <strong><span style="background-color: yellow; backgroundclip: initial; backgroundorigin: initial;">to culturally annihilate</span></strong> all <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">those who</span> dare to <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">differ</span> from the American dream.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Exactly this attitude, </span>culturalizing the willing, bombing the recalcitrant, into a future they must surely want <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(for everyone is born with ‘‘freedom in their hearts’’), </span>has already killed tens of thousands of largely innocent people in Iraq<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (and for every episode of ‘‘collateral damage’’ read a hundred angry kids vowing revengeful lives). But if the Barnetts of this world get their way, </span><strong><span style="background-color: yellow; backgroundclip: initial; backgroundorigin: initial;">Iraq is merely the beginning of a perpetual war to create the conditions of a lasting peace</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (a Pax Americana whose next regime change candidates, Iran and North Korea, are already lined up</span>). We will <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">bring them democracy, whether they want it or not. <strong>We will force them to be free</strong></span>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And we will continue doing so for generations to come. As Barnett (2004b:148) said more recently about the US invasion of Iraq: </span>‘‘The boys are never coming home<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>America is not leaving the Middle East until the Middle East joins the world.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It’s that simple. No exit means no exit strategy’’. So Barnett tells the younger, progressive officers at the Pentagon, the future leaders of the armed forces who will ‘‘protect’’ Americanism in a future made less certain by the explosions of September 11. With such double-speak, </span>Americentrism shows itself to be the <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">most dangerous ideology the world has ever known</span>, far more dangerous than Eurocentrism essentially because of two things: because even a simple reflexivity allows almost complete immunity from effective self-criticism; and because <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">of</span> <strong><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">a techno-logical ability to destroy civilizations at will</span>.</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Jim’s critique of Eurocentrism needs replicating with an equally compelling critique of Americentrism. </span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Neither is it necessarily the case that the region is the spatial scale influencing competitive advantage. New </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Regionalism</span> has come under increasing attack for its tendency to <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">take the fundamental concept of ‘the region’ for granted</span> thereby <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">displaying</span> a kind of ‘<span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">spatial fetishism’ that tends to elide intra-regional divisions</span> and <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">tensions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (</span><span style="border: windowtext 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">MacKinnon et al., 2002</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">). Similarly,</span><span style="border: windowtext 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">Lovering (1999)</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">observes that </span>it is not always clear how <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the abstract notion of the ‘region’</span> used in competitiveness discourse <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">relates to the actual regions in which people and firms reside</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and, to the spatial delimitations which may influence competitive advantage. Some authors have argued that the </span>spatial specificities that provide the impetus for economic development and firm competitiveness may exist at the local (e.g. city) rather than the regional scale<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (see, for example,</span> <span style="border: windowtext 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">Hamilton, 1991</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">;</span> <span style="border: windowtext 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">Healey and Dunham, 1994</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">;</span> <span style="border: windowtext 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">Begg, 1999</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">;</span> <span style="border: windowtext 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">Kresl and Singh, 1999</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">;</span><span style="border: windowtext 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">Waters and Lawton Smith, 2002</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">).</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is not to say that the region and localisation economies are irrelevant to the performance of firms. Rather the argument here is that their significance tends to be overstated in the regional competitiveness discourse. In practice, </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the region's influence may vary depending on the particular industrial structure and context</span>, the balance of globally- and locally-orientated firms, and the degree to which the region constitutes an internally cohesive, homogenous economic space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The critical point is that the nature and significance of this contingency is barely acknowledged in the regional competitiveness discourse. There is thus an inherent paradox here in that whilst </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the discourse emphasises the importance of factors endogenous to the region in shaping firm performance, the key ingredients for success are uniformly prescribed making for a ‘one-size fits all’ approach to regional economic development policy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The result is that policy-makers and economic development practitioners across very different regions end up pursuing ‘identikit’ competitiveness strategies based upon improving regional institutional thickness, with no clear prioritisation or tailoring of the dominant prescriptions to suit local circumstances.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The regional competitiveness discourse is also </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">characterised by the belief that regional economic performance and prosperity is ultimately derived from and thus is reducible to the competitiveness of firms in the region</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In so doing, </span>it displays a narrow focus on the firm and on</em> <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial; border: windowtext 1pt; font-family: Georgia,serif; padding: 0in;">growth in</span> <em><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">a region rather than the</span></em> <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial; border: windowtext 1pt; font-family: Georgia,serif; padding: 0in;">development of</span> <em><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">a region</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (see</span> <span style="border: windowtext 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">Markusen, 1994</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; also</span><span style="border: windowtext 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">Perrons, 2004</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">). Thus, even if the rationale for creating a supportive microeconomic business environment for the development of productive firms is accepted, the importance of this for the improvement of regional living standards is much less clearly defensible. Indeed, Porter's thesis has been criticised for its general failure to perfectly reconcile the micro-level analysis of the competitive advantage of firms with the macro-level analysis of development prosperity (</span><span style="border: windowtext 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">Grant, 1991</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">). Porter simply presumes some ‘invisible hand’ whereby the pursuit of competitive advantage by firms translates into increasing productivity and prosperity. As</span><span style="border: windowtext 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">Martin and Sunley (2003</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, 15) observe, ‘equating competitiveness with productivity is to invite tautology and ontological confusion: is a region more competitive because it is more productive, or is it more productive because it is more competitive?’ </span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 15.6px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 22px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">As any university student knows, theories about the “social con­struction” and social effects of language have become a common feature of academic scholarship. Conservative critics often argue that those who use these theories of language (e.g., deconstruc­tion) are “just” talking about language, as opposed to talking about the “real world.” The essays in this book, by contrast, begin from the premise that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">l</span></span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">anguage matters in the <strong>most concrete, im­mediate way possible</strong></span><strong>:</strong> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">its use</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by</span> political and military <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">leaders, <strong>leads directly to violence</strong></span> in the form of <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">war</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">mass murder</span></strong> (in­cluding <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">genocide</span>), <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the</span> physical <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">destruction of human commu­nities</span>, and the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">devastation of the natural environment</span>. Indeed, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">if the world ever witnesses a nuclear holocaust, it will probably be because leaders </span>in more than one country <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have succeeded in convincing their people</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">through</span> the use of political <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">language, that the use of nuclear weapons</span> and, if necessary, the destruction of the earth itself, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is justifiable</span>. From our perspective, then, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">every act of political violence</span>—from the horrors perpetrated against Native Americans to the murder of political dissidents in the So­viet Union to the destruction of the World Trade Center, and now the bombing of Afghanistan—<strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is</span> intimately <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">linked with the use of language</span></strong>. Partly what we are talking about here, of course, are the processes of “manufacturing consent”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and shaping people’s per­ception of the world around them; people are more likely to sup­port acts of violence committed in their name if the recipients of the violence have been defined as “terrorists,” or if the violence is presented as a defense of “freedom.” Media analysts such as Noam Chomsky have written eloquently about the corrosive ef­fects that this kind of process has on the political culture of sup­posedly democratic societies. At the risk of stating the obvious, however, the most fundamental effects of violence are those that are visited upon the objects of violence; </span><u>the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">language that shapes</span> public <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">opinion is the same language that burns villages</span>, besieges entire populations, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">kills</span> and maims <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">human</span> bodies, and leaves the ground scarred with bomb craters and littered with land mines. As George Orwell so famously illustrated in his work, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">acts of vio­lence can</span> easily <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">be made </span>more <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">palatable through</span> the use of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">eu­phemisms such as “pacification</span>” or, to use an example discussed in this book, “targets.” It is important to point out, however, that the need for such language derives from the simple fact that the violence itself is abhorrent. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Were it not for</span> the abstract <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">language of</span> “vital interests” and “surgical strikes” and the flattering lan­guage of “<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">civilization” and ‘just” wars, we would be less likely to avert our</span> mental <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">gaze from the physical effects of violence</span>.</u></span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-family: Georgia; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; padding: 0px;">In the past<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, we/they, neighbor/foreigner, </span>friend/enemy polarities were inside/outside distinctions that produced a plurality of worlds<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, separated by physical and cultural borders.</span> When these <span style="font-size: 8pt;">worlds</span> collided, it was not always <span style="font-size: 8pt;">a</span> pretty <span style="font-size: 8pt;">picture</span>, but it was <span style="font-size: 8pt;">often </span>possible to maintain the integrity of the<span style="font-size: 8pt;">we/they</span> distinction, even <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to</span> regulate it by distinguishing between domestic and foreign affairs. If &quot;they&quot; differed, &quot;we&quot; did not <span style="font-size: 8pt;">always</span> feel ourselves obliged to make &quot;them&quot; into mini<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ature </span>versions of &quot;us,&quot; <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to Christianize them</span>, to civilize them, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to make of them good liberals</span>. Things have changed. With a single-power global hegemony <span style="font-size: 8pt;">that is</span> guided by a universalist ideology, all relations <span style="font-size: 8pt;">have become, or</span> threaten to become, domestic<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The inner/outer distinction has been transformed into a morally and legally determined acceptable/unacceptable one, and the power exists (or is thought to exist), both spiritually and physically, to eliminate the unacceptable once and for all and make believers of everyone. </span>The new imperative <span style="font-size: 8pt;">states: </span>the other shall be included. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Delivered as</span> a promise<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, it can only be</span> received<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, by some,</span> as an ominous threat<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In his The Conquest of America, Tzvetan Todorov approaches our relationship to the &quot;other&quot; by way of three interlocking distinctions, namely, self/other, same/different, and equal/unequal. A simple superposition of all three distinctions makes of the other someone who is different and therefore unequal. </span>The problem<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> we have been discussing, however, </span>comes <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to light</span> when we make <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of</span> the other someone <span style="font-size: 8pt;">who is</span> equal because he is essentially the same. This <span style="font-size: 8pt;">form of the</span> universalist ideology is assimilationist. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It denies the other by embracing him. Of the famous sixteenth-century defender of the Indians, Bartolomé de Las Casas, Todorov writes, [his] declaration of the equality of men is made in the name of a specific religion, Christianity.... Hence, there is a potential danger of seeing not only the Indians' human nature asserted but also their Christian &quot;nature.&quot; &quot;The natural laws and rules and rights of men,&quot; Las Casas said; but who decides what is natural with regard to laws and rights? Is it not specifically the Christian religion? Since Christianity is universalist, it implies an essential non-difference on the part of all men. We see the danger of the identiWcation in this text of Saint John Chrysostrom, quoted and defended at Valladolid: &quot;Just as there is no natural difference in the creation of man, so there is no difference in the call to salvation of all men, barbarous or wise, since God's grace can correct the minds of barbarians, so that they have a reasonable understanding.&quot; Once again we see that the term &quot;human&quot; is not descriptive, but evaluative. To be truly human, one needs to be corrected. Regarding the relationship of difference and equality, Todorov concludes, &quot;If it is [End Page 139] incontestable that the prejudice of superiority is an obstacle in the road to knowledge, we must also admit that the prejudice of equality is a still greater one, for it consists in identifying the other purely and simply with one's own 'ego ideal' (or with oneself)&quot; (1984, 165). </span>Such identification is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not only </span>the essence<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of Christianity, but also of the doctrine</span> of human rights<span style="font-size: 8pt;">preached by enthusiasts like Habermas and Rawls. </span>And <span style="font-size: 8pt;">such identification</span> means that the other is stripped of <span style="font-size: 8pt;">his</span> otherness and made to conform to the universal ideal of what it means to be human. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">And yet, despite—indeed,</span> because of—the all-encompassing embrace, the detested other is never allowed to leave the stage altogether<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even as we seem on the verge of actualizing Kant's dream, as Habermas puts it, of &quot;a cosmopolitan order&quot; </span>that unites all peoples and abolishes war<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> under the auspices of &quot;the states of the First World&quot; who &quot;can afford to harmonize their national interests to a certain extent with the norms that define the halfhearted cosmopolitan aspirations of the UN&quot; (1998, 165, 184), it is still fascinating to see how the barbarians make their functionally necessary presence felt. John Rawls, in his The Law of Peoples (1999), conveniently divides the world into well-ordered peoples and those who are not well ordered. Among the former are the &quot;reasonable liberal peoples&quot; and the &quot;decent hierarchical peoples&quot; (4). Opposed to them are the &quot;outlaw states&quot; and other &quot;burdened&quot; peoples who are not worthy of respect.</span>Liberal peoples, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">who, by virtue of their history, possess superior institutions, culture, and moral character (23-25)</span>, have not only the right to deny non-well-ordered peoples respect, but the duty to extend w<span style="font-size: 8pt;">hat Vitoria called &quot;brotherly correction&quot; and Habermas [called] &quot;gentle compulsion&quot; (Habermas 1997, 133). That is, </span>Rawls believes that the &quot;refusal to tolerate&quot; those states deemed to be outlaw states &quot;is a consequence of liberalism and decency.&quot;<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Why? </span>Because outlaw states violate human rights<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What are human rights? &quot;What I call human rights,&quot; Rawls states, &quot;are ... a proper subset of the rights possessed by citizens in a liberal constitutional democratic regime, or of the rights of the members of a decent hierarchical society&quot; (Rawls 1999, 81). Because of their violation of these liberal rights,</span> nonliberal, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">nondecent</span> societies do not even have the right &quot;to protest their condemnation by the world society&quot; <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(38),</span>and decent peoples have the right<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, if necessary,</span> to wage just wars against them<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Thus, liberal societies are not merely contingently established and historically conditioned forms of organization; they become the universal standard against which other societies are judged. </span>Those found wanting are banished, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">as outlaws</span>, from the civilized world.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Ironically, one of the signs of their outlaw status is their insistence on autonomy, on sovereignty.</span></span></em><br />

<em><span style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; padding: 0px;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">‘Humanity as such’, Schmitt noted, ‘cannot wage war because it has no enemy’, (1996a: 54), indicating that humanity ‘is a polemical word that negates its opposite’ (Kennedy 1998: 94; emphasis added). In The Concept of the Political Schmitt argued that humanity ‘excludes the concept of the enemy, because the enemy does not cease to be a human being’ (1996a: 54). However, in his 1950 book with an international focus, The Nomos of the Earth, Schmitt noted how only when ‘man appeared to be the embodiment of absolute humanity, did the other side of this concept appear in the form of a new enemy: the inhuman’ (2003a: 104). It becomes apparent that, historically examined, the concept of humanity engenders a return to a ‘discriminatory concept of war’, by which Schmitt meant that it reintroduces the legitimacy and need for substantive causes of justice in war (Schmitt 2003b: 37-52). This in turn disallows the notion of justus hostis, of a ‘just enemy’ – explored in section three – associated with the notion of non-discriminatory interstate war which took the shape of guerre en forme (Schmitt 2003a: 142-144). The concept of humanity, therefore, shatters the formal concept of justus hostis, allowing the enemy to now be designated substantively as an enemy of humanity as such. This leaves the enemy of humanity with no value and open to dehumanisation and political and physical annihilation (Schmitt 2004: 67). In discussing the League of Nations, Schmitt highlights that, compared to the kinds of wars that can be waged on behalf of humanity, the interstate European wars from 1815 to 1914 in reality were regulated; they were bracketed by the neutral Great Powers and were completely legal procedures in comparison with the modern and gratuitous police actions against violators of peace, which can be dreadful acts of annihilation (Schmitt 2003a: 186). Enemies of humanity cannot be considered ‘just and equal’. Moreover, they cannot claim neutrality: one cannot remain neutral in the call to be for or against humanity or its freedom; one cannot, similarly, claim a right to resist or defend oneself, in the sense we understand this right to have existed in the international law of Europe (the jus publicum Europeaum). Such a denial of self-defence and resistance ‘can presage a dreadful nihilistic destruction of all law’ (ibid.: 187). When the enemy is not accorded a procedural justice and formal equality, the notion that peace can be made with him is unacceptable, as Schmitt detailed through his study of the League of Nations, which had declared the abolition of war, but in rescinding the concept of neutrality only succeeded in the ‘dissolution of “peace”’ (ibid.: 246). It is with the dissolution of peace that total wars of annihilation become possible, where ‘the other’ cannot be assimilated, or accommodated, let alone </span><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">tolerated: the friend/enemy distinction is not longer taking place with a justus hostis but rather between good and evil, human and inhuman, where ‘the negative pole of the distinction is to be fully and finally consumed without remainder’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Rasch 2003: 137).</span></span></span></em><br />

The collapse of this order, then, signalled the end of modernity and brought about epochal changes in the conduct of politics and war (Schmitt 1996; Zarmanian 2006). While he did ponder what new political forms would emerge from the ruins of the old order (see Schmitt 2003: 354–355; Luoma-aho, Chapter 2 in this volume), at the time of writing the</em> Nomos <em><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 10pt;">Schmitt believed that international politics was still caught up in a ‘spaceless universalism’</span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">, a term which is still useful in capturing the current global situation today, despite claims that the end of the Cold War has meant a victory for the US leading to an American Empire (Cox 2003, 2004; see also Reid 2005). I would like to explore this ‘spaceless universalism’ under the heading of today’s cosmopolitanism and discuss some of the repercussions of its claim to ‘erase’ the lines or distinctions drawn by Westphalia and to promote the political idea(l) of a universal humanity. Schmitt had argued vehemently against the ‘spaceless universalism’ which followed the </span></em>jus publicum Europaeum<em>. <span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 10pt;">The major </span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">public</span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 10pt;"> actors of </span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">the</span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 10pt;"> post-First World War </span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">order</span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 10pt;"> were </span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">unable and</span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 10pt;"> unwilling to draw lines and spatial distinctions, espousing instead normative and institutional ideals of a universal </span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">and absolute</span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 10pt;"> humanity</span><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">.3 For Schmitt, the era of a ‘</span><strong><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 10pt;">spaceless universalism’ transformed</span></strong><span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;"> the notion of </span></em>nomos <em>‘from a spatially concrete, constitutive act of order and orientation . . . into the mere enactment of acts in line with the</em> ought<em>’ (Schmitt 2003: 78), in other words, into a normativism that hesitates to draw distinctions and which is, as a result, unable to humanise war and enable (an albeit limited) peace despite its reliance on the discursive practices of ‘humanity’. Schmitt’s concern was that the political ideal of a common or universal humanity, first promoted by the League of Nations and subsequently by the United Nations (despite the UN Charter’s precarious compromise between promoting human rights and affirming state sovereignty and non-intervention), would not rid the world of exclusions. Schmitt’s analysis in the Nomos led him to argue that a certain ‘“dialectic” of inclusion and exclusion’ operated in each historical era; similarly, apportioning and dividing the earth served to concretise each political epoch, and was, therefore, at the basis of political order. Such exclusions and divisions should not be ignored or could not be easily rescinded, as was believed by the League of Nations (Rasch 2003: 121). The hesitation of the post-First World War era, and presumably our current reluctance, to draw such distinctions could be seen to be misguided, therefore: ‘[e]very new age and every new epoch in the coexistence of peoples, empires, and countries, of rulers and power formations of every sort, is founded on new spatial divisions, new enclosures, and new spatial orders of the earth’ (Schmitt 2003: 79). Rather, the unwillingness or inability to concretely draw lines would not entail their permanent erasure but, rather, might indicate the return of substantive conceptual distinctions that could lead to even more horrendous ‘otherings’ and exclusions, as is arguably occurring within the current environment of the War on Terror. Below, I examine certain cosmopolitan discourses particularly prevalent in international politics since 1989 and the ways in which the discourse of humanity perpetuates the aforementioned dialectic of inclusion and exclusion. Subsequently, I reflect on whether, and how, the War on Terror functions according to a similar dialectic: the creation of unity in the Western world, which is threatened and needs securing, and which excludes those whose assumed fundamentalist tendencies motivate them to act against ‘freedom’. The new lines drawn by this ‘spaceless universalism’ are conceptual and are only now, perhaps, finding their spatial expression. Conceivably, just as non-European space (and practices within this space) ‘functioned <span style="color: #1a1718; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">as the “environment” that guaranteed the overall unity and identity of the internally differentiated “system” that was Europe’ (Rasch 2003: 121), today lands which harbour ‘global terrorism’ might well begin to function as that ‘environment’ which maintains the overall unity of the ‘West’, mobilised by the fear of terror and its just war against it. Under these conditions, lines between self and other are, nevertheless, just as exclusionary and have, possibly, just as grave repercussions as did the lines drawn between self and other under the </span></em>nomos <em>of the earth.</em><br />

<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- When President Barack </span><strong><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Obama</span></strong> returns from South Korea next week, he <strong>could</strong> <strong><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">set the tone for dealing with</span> the newly divided U.S. <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Congress</span></strong> by bringing home a trade deal with bipartisan appeal.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Business groups, which largely favored Republicans in the mid-term elections, are hoping that a quick resolution of the stalled trade talks with South Korea could mark the beginning of a more pro-business shift by the administration.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&quot;There isn't a business executive alive these days that is supporting this administration,&quot; said Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Association, whose members include Apple Inc. (AAPL) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). &quot;I think fighting for free trade agreements and promoting exports is the best thing this administration can do, other than give some stability in the tax sphere.&quot;</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">After campaigning against trade deals his predecessor negotiated in 2007 with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, Obama has since sought to address the perceived shortcomings as part of an effort to double exports in five years. In June, he set a timetable to rework the South Korea pact by his visit to Seoul next week and send it up for congressional approval in the coming months.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Yet, prospects for renegotiating and passing the Korean deal remain uncertain. The White House isn't letting on how last-minute talks are progressing, and the rising decibel of anti-trade rhetoric during the mid-term elections has raised concerns about whether enough support can be generated in the newly Republican- controlled House of Representatives.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">When South Korean President Lee Myung-bak called Monday, Obama expressed hope that progress toward an agreement could be made before his Nov. 11 visit for the Group of 20 summit. According to the White House, his message to Lee was direct: &quot;If we can reach a satisfactory agreement on the key issues for American workers, we will have a deal.&quot;</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Trade officials from the two countries will hold working-level discussions on the deal Thursday and Friday in Seoul, U.S. Trade Representative spokeswoman Carol Guthrie said Wednesday.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Mike </span>Froman<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, told reporters Monday he couldn't predict the outcome. But he said &quot;</span> <strong><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">maximum effort</span></strong><strong><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial; font-size: 8pt;">&quot; </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">is going into achieving</span></strong> the necessary<strong><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;"> access for U.S. autos and beef to make the deal palatable</span></strong> before the presidents meet<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The U.S. hasn't disclosed its specific demands, with Froman citing a &quot;whole variety of issues around auto market access.&quot;</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">While the 2007 deal phases out tariffs on both sides, U.S. auto makers complain that it does little to address non-tariff barriers like regulations that have kept imports at just 6% of new car sales in South Korea.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">An auto industry official said the administration clearly understands the obstacles and what kind of leverage is needed to improve access, but the question is whether the South Koreans will move enough.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span>We know <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">administration is pressing the Koreans</span></strong></span> hard <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">to <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">open the market</span></span>, and that <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">there is </span>quite a bit of <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">support for that position in Congress</span>, both <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">among Republicans and Democrats</span>,&quot;<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the official said. &quot;What we don't know is how badly the Koreans want a free trade agreement.&quot;</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Depending on how good of a deal the U.S. can get, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the official expressed &quot; cautious optimism&quot; about the prospects of winning congressional approval</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Newly elected Republicans in formerly Democratic seats may not want one of their first votes to be on a divisive trade deal, especially those backed by tea party voters that have showed skepticism about trade.</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Doug </span>Goudie, director of international trade policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, said he is pretty confident Obama and Lee will reach a deal<span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> While autos are the biggest economic issue, the beef dispute carries more emotional import for South Korea, he said.</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The lifting of a ban on U.S. beef imports in 2008 sparked massive street protests in Seoul, leading the government to restrict imports of older cattle considered more at risk of mad-cow disease. South Korea has showed little inclination that it would consider easing those restrictions.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">During a trip to Seoul with other U.S. business representatives last month, Goudie said </span>a <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">clear message was <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">delivered to</span></span> senior <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Korean officials that</span> both the <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">auto and beef provisions must be resolved by the president's visit</span> in order <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">to win congressional approval</span> in the first half of the year. The U.S. is concerned about losing ground to the European Union, whose free trade deal with South Korea will go into effect at the beginning of July.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span>We cautioned the Koreans that the G-20 is the deadline and, secondly, don't expect to have a different offer if Republicans take the House and/or the Senate on Nov. 2, because in the end the president needs to be satisfied with it,&quot;<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> he said.</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Goudie</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> agreed </span>the reception for the deal back home will depend on whether it achieves meaningful access for U.S. exports, but <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">expects<strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">strong bipartisan support in the end</span></strong></span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial; font-size: 8pt;">.</span> The Korean deal could serve as a &quot;confidence-building measure&quot; for further bipartisan cooperation on trade,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> he said.</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Trade has</span> traditionally <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">been one </span>of the <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">areas where </span>a <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Democratic </span>president <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">can find common ground with </span>opposing lawmakers, and recent comments from prominent <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Republicans </span>suggest that could continue.</span></em><br />

If President Obama is genuinely serious about clean energy and successfully expanding markets for American entrepreneurs, he should submit the KORUS FTA for congressional ratification without further delay, according to the November 2010 timetable he indicated during the recent G-20 summit in Toronto.</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0in;">Freer Trade Is Key to Clean Energy and Protecting the Environment</span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">When a country <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">lowers</span> its <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">barriers to trade</span>, it <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">opens</span> its <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">economy to competitive opportunities for greater efficiency</span> and dynamic economic growth<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Competition spurs the movement of labor and capital from industries that cannot compete to those that can,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> enabling a nation to both produce more efficiently and attract new investment.</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The need to adhere to such a strategy is no less important today than in previous eras. Free trade expands the base for vibrant innovation and growth. In countries around the world, trade has been shown to be one of the greatest drivers of technological change. </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Clean energy technology is no exception.</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Indeed, the most <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">practical improvements in clean energy technology efficiency</span> and environmental protection over the past decades have not<span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">stem</span>med from government mandates, but <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">by</span> freer trade and <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">economic freedom.</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0in;">The KORUS FTA: Compelling Case for Advancing Green Growth</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In 2007, the U.S. and South Korea concluded a free trade pact that in part reflects and in part encourages a virtuous economic relationship between the two nations. The agreement has been characterized as “strong and balanced” and as “an agreement for the 21st century.”</span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Key features of the agreed trade deal include reducing tariff rates on 95 percent of all consumer and industrial products, improving transparency and intellectual property rights protection, and addressing standards and regulations. Indeed, if timely ratified, America firmly stands to gain from the KORUS FTA, particularly given its competitive edge in innovation, commercialization, and deployment of advanced technologies.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">South Korea has been heralded as a leader in crafting green growth </span>strategies in recent years. <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Since 2008</span>, South Korean President <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Lee</span> Myung-bak’s long-term <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">vision of “Low Carbon, Green Growth” has driven policy to dramatically expand clean energy usage</span>.</strong></span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Significant components of <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">the plan aim to attract international partners and foreign technologies</span>. This presents a tremendous market opportunity for American entrepreneurs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, </span>most if not all of the targeted economic sectors under the “green growth vision” are in sectors of U.S. competitive strength. <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">Key U.S. exports </span>to those sectors <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">include </span>industrial electronic machinery, auto parts, <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">power generation equipment, and scientific equipment. </span>These exports are all directly or indirectly <span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">related to clean energy technology.</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin: 0px; padding: 0in;">Time for Action</span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">As America has a comparative advantage over South Korea in commercializing and deploying </span><span style="background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-origin: initial;">clean energy technology such as solar, wind, nuclear, and smart grids, the trade pact would capitalize on</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> an existing strength. The U.S. need not fear clean energy competition from South Korea. Business and workers in both countries would benefit.</span></span></em><br />

Unfortunately we are going to have to put tremendous pressure on elected public officials to force the EPA to crack down on GHG polluters (including industrial farms and food processors).

<em><strong>Our findings suggest that <u>there is a strong case for supporting more principled and narrowly-defined forms of humanitarian action in Afghanistan separate or insulated from the international community’s world-ordering agenda</u>. <u>The act of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">saving and pro­tecting the lives of civilians</span> caught up in crisis and conflict can and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">should be kept separate from partisan</span></u> or politically-driven <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">stabilization operations</span>. A <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">space needs to be reserved for humani­tarian actors</span> working according to time-tested principles who are thus prepared to engage with all sets of belligerents</u>. Donor governments who have subscribed to the Good Humanitarian Donorship (<u>GHD</u>) <u>initiative have a key responsibility here. They should recognize the seriousness of the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan</u> and agree to fund urgent humanitarian action with no strings attached (as they do for the ICRC). Of course, UN and NGOs need to clean up their act, too. They cannot cloak themselves in the mantle of principled humanitarianism while si­multaneously working for the government or the PRTs. This puts them and the communities they work with at risk. Distinction is key.</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Some will no doubt argue that in today’s asymmetrical conflicts, there is no space for neutrality—you are either for or against. Our view is that <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Afghanistan</span> (and Iraq) <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">demonstrates</span> the exact opposite: the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">shrinking of humanitarian space</span> and the instrumentalization of humanitarian action have had deleterious effects for communities needing assistance</u>, for the security of humanitarian aid workers, and for the credibility of their orga­nizations. Thus<u>, a more modest humanitarian enterprise, closer in ambition and intent to classical, time-tested <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">humanitarian principles, stands a better chance of saving and protecting</span> larger numbers of lives than does today’s increasingly politically-driven and militarized forms of relief.</u></strong></em><br />
<em><strong>From a humanitarian perspective<u>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the first priority</span> in Afghanistan today <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is to alleviate human suffering</span>, staunch the loss of lives, and, especially, protect civilians from avoidable mortality, hardship, and displacement</u>. All belligerents must respect IHL and <u>abide by the core principles of distinction and proportionality</u>. The aerial bombing of weddings is never proportional;<span class="A13">15</span>neither is putting bombs in crowded areas. The UN has spoken out against these abuses, and this is a welcome development, but much more needs to be done to advocate for the rights of civilians and to ensure their protection.</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>As for the humanitarians, and the international community that supports them, there are two key areas where urgent attention is needed.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>There is no <u>humanitarian consensus</u> in Afghanistan and very little humanitarian space. Both have been <u>trampled by political expediency and by the disregard by all parties to the conflict for the plight of civilians</u>. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Civilians are dying because of conflict and insecurity</span>. According to UNAMA, there has been a 40% increase of civilian casualties in 2008.

Conflict-related displacement is a seriously under-addressed issue. <u>Estimates of the numbers of displaced vary</u>, but <u>there is agreement among aid workers that they are on the rise and that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the international community is not doing enough, even in places like Kabul, where access is possible.</span></u></strong></em><br />
<em><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Aid agency staff are being increasingly targeted</span> by the Taliban and other insurgents <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">for their perceived instrumentalization by,</span> and support of, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">alien political agendas</span></u>. Access and operational space are almost nonexistent in the south, south-east, and parts of the west of the country. Large swathes of the country are no- go areas to the extent that it is now impossible even to have a clear picture of the humanitarian situation on the ground. <u>The combined effects of conflict, drought, increased food prices, and a long history of recurring disasters are thought to be severe in parts of the country, but the actual depth and breadth of the crisis are as yet unknown.</u></strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Thus, the aid community in <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Afghanistan faces severe challenges that need to be urgently addressed</span> so that civilians in need can be protected and assisted and the credibility of the humanitarian en­terprise restored. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Failure to do so will have dire consequences for Afghans and for the future of humanitarianism worldwide.</span></u></strong></em><br />

<em>Counter advocacy – we affirm the 1AC sans Millard South’s use of art, instead affirming anti-art.</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<em><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Anti art breaks away from art put on the wall in a coffee shop, from idle consumers purchasing paintings to fit in with their neighbors, from corn-fed people staring at a wall in a museum trying to figure out what the artist means. We oppose reprints and post prints and art as distinct from everyday life. Anti art opposes Millard South’s attempt to imbue Cat’s Cradle with meaning, as a reflection of reality, as a something to reduce and understand. Art must be transitive lest it <span style="border: windowtext 1pt solid; padding: 0in;">castrate</span> the artist – art has become a Nieztschean god from whom we must break away. </span></em><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But now to anti-art in earnest. As I conceive it, at its best, </span><u>the move- ment of <span style="background: yellow;">anti-art represents a repudiation of all the self-limiting &quot;isms</span>&quot; and &quot;counter-isms&quot; indelibly inscribed in traditional aesthetics and philosophies of criticism and of art</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It </span><u>values the assault of aesthetics upon <span style="background: yellow;">doctrines of imitation that turn the art object into a vehicle for the realization of ends that are not its own.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But </span></span><strong><u><span style="background: yellow;">it opposes the castra- tion of the artist and his work which is the penalty paid by aesthetics and aesthetic art for its victory</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It stands, however, not for the un- aesthetic -that is, the merely utilitarian, economic, or political interests of men, but </span><u>for anti-aestheticism</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which is quite another thing. Anti-aestheticism is opposed to such fashionable doctrines as &quot;the intentional fallacy,&quot; which turns the work of art into an her- metically sealed aesthetic object whose deep secret, finally, is only that it is an illusion. </span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But it is not just the aesthetic object which </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">anti-art</span></u> <u><span style="background: yellow;">opposes</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but in one sense </span><u>the work of <span style="background: yellow;">art</span> itself. <span style="background: yellow;">It is opposed,</span> first of all, <span style="background: yellow;">to the reduc- tion of poems and novels,</span> not to mention films, dancing, and well- constructed buildings, to a single common denominator, toward which the interested person can properly stand in only one rigid relation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: call it &quot;contemplation&quot; for short. It is opposed to a life of elegant, detached looking and over-looking, to rich and richly appointed houses for external objects which can be moved, but only at a price. </span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><u>It is opposed to the cult of the collector, the benefactor, the fetishism of the nearly priceless art object which only oil magnates and their progeny can afford.</u> <u><span style="background: yellow;">It opposes</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> all the airless opulence, the goodish </span><u>taste</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the expensiveness, and the barely concealed </span><u>commercialism</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> symbolized by our national galleries and by what Harold Rosenberg calls the art establishment. And it opposes all </span><u>the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> attendent </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">gallimaufry of work-of- art-ism: the separation of literature</span>, painting, sculpture, and the rest from other things, <span style="background: yellow;">from the events</span> and activities and decisions of com- mon experience</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; the whole idea, in fact, of an intentionless artifact which, rid now of its embarrassing creator or producer, and at the same time </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">demanding that its admirer remain a merely detached ob- server who keeps his distance, respects the immobile, self-enclosed and self-enclosing and now irrelevant thing,</span> with no living being to keep it company</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Anti-art and the anti-artist seek to restore the so-called work of art to its rightful place as a sublimated and sublimating focus of our whole unbearable humanity, not our senses or minds only, but our bodies, our very being</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Or, if this seems a bit overdrawn and over- 114 HENRY D. AIKEN wrought, the exponent of anti-art may be viewed more simply and truly as one who notices the curious way in which the notion of the art-lover, the lover of art, when we take it seriously, makes adulterers of us all, by forcing us to treat our &quot;other&quot; love for the work as some- thing illicit, something we cannot acknowledge even to ourselves as a legitimate relation to the object. </span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is as though </span><u>when we give the title &quot;work of art&quot; to a picture, a piece of music, or a coffee pot, we are forced by that act into a primarily ritual relation to it which de- prives us at the same time of that intimate yet full and exuberant reality</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> which we first found in Henry Moore, in Frank Lloyd Wright, or in Beckett. There is a sense in which I cannot bear even to discuss my relations to Figaro or to Crazy Jane. When I treat Figaro or Crazy Jane as works of art, however, when I try to view them merely as such, my relationship necessarily becomes a public relationship, and my act a public act. Now, perforce we begin to adopt poses toward one an- other. </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">Our</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> interlocking </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">roles become stylized</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And in short we </span><u>become</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in effect the </span><u>parties to a contract,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with duties to one another, for which others may henceforth hold us accountable. But there remains, if you will, a more precious, a truly Crazy Jane which is merely mine, which permits me to do all sorts of unmentionable things to it, which ravishes me and, in turn, impatiently awaits my ravishment. This Jane is not an honest work of art but an incomparable mistress, impossibly de- manding and intolerably ardent. Indeed, what has the work-of-art to do with all this sentimental, subjective, illicit affection that exists be- tween poor Jane and me? </span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">It is precisely this descent into subjective actuality over which the idea of anti-art presides. But there is another side of the matter which must now be mentioned. In our time </span><strong><u><span style="background: yellow;">the work of art has become</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in its ritual way, a kind of surrogate </span><strong><u><span style="background: yellow;">god</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; as a work of art, a building, drama, or symphony invites, or requires, not mere admiration of its devotee, but </span><u>a kind of worship</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In fact it is precisely </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">this tendency</span> in the modem age <span style="background: yellow;">to convert the artist into a</span> surrogate <span style="background: yellow;">priest</span> and the work of art into a temple or shrine, or, worse, into a divinity in its own right, against <span style="background: yellow;">which anti-art-ism is also a protest.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Here, let me remind you, it was T. S. Eliot who, with his usual perceptiveness, pointed the way many years ago. There was a time when I, for one, felt that Eliot had simply become so preoccupied with Other Things that he neglected, or had forgotten, his muse. It seemed to me that, as in the case of Coleridge, his turning to religion, or theology, was merely a sign that his power as an artist was used up. I thought in fact that ART AND ANTI-ART 115 God for him was a kind of consolation prize. But Eliot of course was right and I simply uncomprehending, whatever may be the truth about the quality of his later work. Eliot was opposed, among other things, to idolatry and to the sentimentality of the idolater. God is not, cannot be, a work of art or an artist, though an analogy in this direction may perhaps help to give life to our fading love both of art and of God. </span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The point, however, is that </span><u>neither works of art nor artists are or should be treated as Gods. Their holiness is not definitive but at best exemplary, and this, for one thing, because works of art do not begin to exhaust the works of mind which are matters of intrinsic and en- during concern to us</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. They are a salient part of that significant being which makes life at once tolerable and incomparably precious. But they are a part only. And </span></span><strong><u><span style="background: yellow;">when we equate art with significant being we diminish both</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Or worse, </span><u>we</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> all strangely </span><u>begin to find the being of art appalling</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, something to escape from into something else we then misname Reality. There would be no life in works of art if life itself were meaningless; nor could tragic art help to redeem calamity or make meaningful our sense of mortality if death itself were nothing. </span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Work-of-art-ism, like its twin brother, aestheticism, is essentially a frivolous attitude, as Bernard Berenson for one discovered in his own unexpectedly self-renewing old age. The pure work of art is indeed self-contained, just as, in the work of a well-known contemporary aes- thetician, purely aesthetic perception is &quot;intransitive.&quot;1 But for this reason also the anti-artist and the exponent of anti-art protest against a culture which treats the work of art as its essential holy work, and the artist, its creator, as a surrogate divinity. For divinity is never self- contained and holiness never intransitive. Eliot knew better when he pointed out, as early as &quot;Tradition and the Individual Talent,&quot; that just as each genuine poem is a creature of the whole tradition of poetry, whether the poet realizes it or not, so each poem in turn subtly not indelibly alters our awareness of the tradition. In reading The Four Quartets, at the top of my own poor form, I find a constant alternation between my experience of the particular word, rhythm, or image and an expanding consciousness in which I find resonances of virtually most of the great poetry - and much great music - of which I am aware. Furthermore, these poems, as my living memory of them de- velops, become aspects of larger organic wholes of which now the works of Eliot and Beethoven, among others, are aspects. Or, to vary the figure, they become links in a greater chain of being, each of which 1I refer, of course, to Eliseo Vivas. 116 HENRY D. AIKEN is indispensable to the others and therefore to the chain. And now, indeed, like Leibnizian monads, The Four Quartets becomes mirrors of all others, reflecting what is wonderful and alive in them. But this life in turn is reflected back in them, so that when one returns again to Beethoven's last quartets, a little forgetful or weary of what one fancied them to be, they again become marvelous as the birth of sound itself. </span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The point is that </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">works of art and our experiences of them are and must be transitive</span>. For their own sakes as well as ours, they must open out upon a larger life and take their places within that larger life</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Nor, let it be</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> emphatically </span><u>added, is this merely a matter of artistic ties</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Or, rather, genuinely literary or artistic works that are something, also belong to something more immense than they. </span><u>Break the connec- tion,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as &quot;the lemon-squeezer school of criticism,&quot; as Eliot once called it, tries to do, and </span><u>what is left is a lifeless pulp, a mere subject-matter for exegetes. It should be a platitude that art is a part of life; it should also be a platitude that because it is indispensably a part of life it cannot be a life in its own right, an absolute end in itself, a truly first cause of being</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. v </span></span></em><br />
<br />
<em><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The action of people is art in itself – all actions have meaning – anti art stands for freedom of the artisan, the worker, the doer to love art for its meaninglessness, its ability to transend meaning. Why Vonnegut? Why not Joyce Harduvel, Charlie Rafkin and you? </span></strong></em><br />

<br />
<em><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">But now, at last, I must bring these ruminations to a close. If I am right, the doctrine of anti-art really belongs to a very old tradition of which all great works of art and all great artists are instinctively rep- resentative. For <u>the tradition of anti-art stands first of all for the free- dom of the artisan, the worker, the doer to do and to be something in his own right and his own way, to start something going which is unclassifiable because it is an individual thing, which, for that very reason, cannot be dealt with, handled, approached in quite the same way as anything before</u> it. If we contemplate Bellini, then we must not merely contemplate Giorgione; if we listen to Scarlatti, then we must do something a little different with Berlioz or Stravinski. If we enjoy Milton, then for that very reason we must do something else with Eliot, Robert Lowell, and W. D. Snodgrass. <u>Aesthetic experience tells us nothing; it is a common denominator which, because it is and means to be nothing else, can never present the essential thing; it is the act which matters, to the audience as well as to the artist, not a manner of enactment which it shares with everything else</u>. It is high time that the <u>notion of re-creation, and not mere aesthetic re-creation, should be refurbished</u>. Our engagements with acts and works of genius do indeed make of us men of second genius. They too are symbolic and imaginative purposive actions in their own right. Nor does it really matter much whether they match exactly that public action which we call the objective work of art. Of course we need the idea of the ob- ART AND ANTI-ART 119 jective work of art, among other things, for academic and scholarly purposes, and the prudent man is always academic and scholarly, as I freely and happily allow. But <u>the objective work of art is not what finally engages us, except as academicians and scholars. It is, as the anti-artist and his advocates insist, what happens to them, or rather what they do with the materials at hand that counts. And they are right.</u> <u>Anti-art represents the semi-divine prerogatives of subjectivity, of the irreducible individual, of that being which is finally worth bother- ing about.</u> And </span></strong><u>the anti-artist, paradoxically, turns to art anything he brings into his work - a tin can, a speck of dust, a cigarette butt</u><strong>. In a way the collage is the proof perfect that just as there is no boundary between art and reality, so there is none between reality and art. Mind, is all.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In contrast to aesthetics, </span>art world research addresses art quality and value within social settings<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The relational dynamics amongst various art world stakeholders, functioning within social structures and institutions, generate the commercial value, popularity and recognition of artists and art works.

But this device tends to appear in a surrogate form, still dissimulated and displaced; it appears and does not appear, makes itself known in ways that further conceal its stakes. And it always appears too late, at the very moment it ceases to function: a kind of theory-death, a death that is not a termination but a particular sort of elaboration. Now, everywhere we look, critics will be casting off their clerical mantles and rhetorical labcoats for suits of discursive armor; the slightest critical aggression or</span></strong><em><strong>ressentiment</strong></em> <strong>will be inflated with theoretical war-machines and territorial metaphorics.<!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:199:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@ref7&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: ref7&quot;/&gt; --><a name="ref7"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:199 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.uchicago.edu/journals/postmodern_culture/v006/6.2mann.html#foot7" rel="nofollow">7</a><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> At the same time, the very rise of war discourse among us will signal the end of intellectual warfare for us, its general recuperation by the economics of intellectual production and exchange. It might therefore be delusional -- even, as some would argue, obscene, given the horrible damage of real war -- to think of this academic bickering as warfare, and yet it remains a </span><em>trace</em> of war, and perhaps the sign of a potential combat some critical force could still fight. It would be a mistake to assume that this metamorphosis of discourse as war into discourse on war has occurred because criticism has become more political. On the contrary,</strong> criticism has never been more than a political <em>effect</em> -- &quot;policy&quot; carried out, and in our case dissipated, by other means <strong>. The long process of seizing politics as the proper object of criticism is one more tardy phenomenalization of the device. What we witness -- and what difference would it make even if I were right? -- is not proof of the politicization of criticism but an after-image of its quite peripheral integration with forms of geopolitical conflict that are, in fact, already being dismantled and remodeled in war rooms, defense institutes, and multinational corporate headquarters. War talk, like politics talk, like ethics talk, like</strong> all critical talk, is nostalgic from the start<strong>. While we babble about territories and borders, really still caught up in nothing more than a habitual attachment to disciplinary &quot;space&quot; and anxious dreams of &quot;agency,&quot; the</strong> technocrats of warfare are developing strategies that no longer depend on any such topography<strong>, strategies far more sophisticated than anything we have imagined. And we congratulate ourselves for condemning them, and for our facile analogies between video games and smart bombs.</strong><br />

We will deal with the latter in Chapter 3, and in the rest of this book. There are a number of areas that have been highlighted regarding the former, i.e. gender bias in language as an abstract system. One of them is the problematic use of pronouns, particularly the (arguably) generic use of 'he', 'him', 'his' to refer to both men and women. <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>Feminists</u></span></span> such as Spender (1990) <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>believe that language is man- made, with male forms being seen as the norm and female ones seen as deviant.</u></span></span> Some have claimed that <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>the use of</u> </span></span></span></strong><br />

<em><strong>generics</strong></em><strong><span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>'he'/,him'/,his', as well as 'man'/'mankind' and expressions like 'the man in the street', to refer to both men and women, reinforces this binary understanding of norm and deviance, promotes male imagery, and makes women invisible.</u> <u>These claims exemplify the 'dominance approach'</u></span></span> (see Chapter 2<span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>), in that the use of generic expressions is seen to be preventing women from expressing and raising consciousness about their own experience, and perpetuating men's domi- nance and exploitative behaviour.</u></span></span> In addition to the male being treated as the norm or unmarked term and to women being hidden behind such terminology, feminists have objected to the use of generic <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>expressions such as 'man',</u></span></span> saying that they <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>are not true generics</u></span></span> (Graddol and Swann, 1989). Spender illustrated this with an example that is acceptable in English: 'Man is the only primate that commits rape'; and an example that is not: 'man being a mam- mal that breastfeeds his young'. Another example where it becomes obvious that 'man' is not a true generic is the sentence 'Man has difficulty in childbirth' (Hekman, j 990). In addition to criticisms regarding the restriction and exclusion of women, the use of generics can be misleading and confusing. For a detailed discussion and a number of examples in this area, which has been the subject of much controversy, see Graddol and Swann (1989). For a thorough investigation into gender-variable pronouns and gender marking in languages other than English, see Hellinger and Hadumod (2001). Other areas of bias in the English language as an abstract system include the fol- lowing: <em>sex specification</em> in the language (e.g. the now outdated 'authoress', or <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>the use of 'she' to refer to countries, boats, motor cars</u></span></span>); <em>gratuitous modifiers</em> (Miller and Swift, 1981) that <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>diminish a person's prestige, drawing attention to their sex</u></span></span> (e.g. 'woman doctor' /'lady doctor') - <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>and while historically the focus for those opposing sexism has been on discrimination against women rather than men, another example of a modifier would be the phrase 'male nurse';</u> </span></span><em>lexical gaps or under-lexicalization,</em> for example <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>having many more terms for promiscuous women than for me</u></span></span>n (Stanley, 1977) and no female equivalents of terms such as 'henpeck', 'virility', 'penetration'; <em>semantic derogation</em> (Schulz, 1975), <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>where a term describing a woman</u> </span></span>initially has neutral connotations, but <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>gradually acquires negative connotations, and becomes abusive or ends up as a sexual slur (e.g. 'lady', 'madam', 'mistress', 'queen '</u></span></span>); relatedly, <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>there are many more negative terms for women than for men, particularly pertaining to sexual behaviour and denoting women as sexual prey</u></span></span> (Cowie and Lees, 1987; Cameron, 1992); <em>asymmetrically gendered language items,</em> i.e. single words used to describe women, for which there is no equivalent for men, and vice versa. <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>For example</u></span></span>, <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>the use of 'fireman'/'policeman'/'chairman'</u> </span></span>(prior to linguistic intervention, see next section); <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>the use of 'Mrs ' to label only women, thus arguably reinforcing a patriarchal order; and the difference in status between lexical items such as 'master', 'bachelor', 'governor', 'god', 'wizard', and their female equivalents;</u> </span></span><em>connotations of language items,</em> such as '<span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>girl</u></span></span>' (which <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>may sometimes indicate immaturity, dependence, triviality, e.g. compare 'weatherman' to 'weathergirl'</u></span></span>); <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>'lady' and 'woman', both of which are often used euphemistically for decorum or to obscure 'negative' associations with sexuality and reproduction; and the nurturing connotations of 'mothering', compared to those of the term 'fathering'</u></span></span> . As will become evident later, bias in the language does not necessarily entail bias in language use, and as we will also see in Chapter 3, sexist discourses mayor may not draw on sexist language items. Words have more than one meaning, and language users' intentions are obscure and unpredictable.</strong><br />

Those making these criticisms suggest that <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>the changes are needed for the sake of feminist goals — either to better allow for feminist work to be done or, more frequently, to bring an end to certain key ways that women are disadvantaged</u></span></span>. In this entry, I examine these criticisms. I also examine work by feminists that seems to suggest some of the criticisms are misplaced: that, for example, <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>philosophy of language is better able to help in feminist projects than critics suppose</u></span></span>. My focus in this entry will generally be on the analytic tradition. There has been a great deal of feminist concern over the supposedly gender-neutral use of terms like ‘he’ and ‘man’. It is commonly said that these terms have both gender-specific meanings, as in sentences (1) and (2), and gender-neutral ones, as in sentences (3) and (4). He drank the wine. A man went into a bar. When a student comes into the room, he should pick up a handout. Man is a primate. Feminists, however, have pointed out that <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>even the supposed gender-neutral meanings of these terms are not really gender-neutral</u></span></span>. Janice Moulton (1981a) and Adele Mercier (1995) provide examples in which there is no doubt that a gender-neutral meaning is intended, but this meaning seems unavailable. As a result, the sentences seem ill-formed: Man has two sexes; some men are female. Man breastfeeds his young. Ask the candidate about his husband or wife. We are, then, making a classificatory error if we claim that ‘man’ and ‘he’ are gender-neutral terms. In order to avoid such a classificatory error, we need to do more careful work on what the meanings of these terms actually are. Perhaps <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>the meaning of ‘he’</u></span></span> that has been called ‘gender-neutral’ <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>is not really gender-neutral</u></span></span>, but something much more complex. Mercier suggests, for example, that we should understand the ‘gender-neutral’ use of ‘man’ as referring to either (a) a person or persons of unknown sex; or (b) males or a combination of males and females. This explains why ‘men’ in (5) and ‘man’ in (6) are anomalous: these terms are being used to refer exclusively to persons known to be female. The supposed ‘gender-neutral’ meaning of these terms, then, is not truly gender neutral. But, on its own, this does not show that there is a problem with those uses that have traditionally been classified as gender-neutral, as in sentences (3) and (4). (Discovering that we have misclassified an adjective as an adverb would not show anything wrong with actual uses of the term in question.) Further reasons are needed in order to object to the use that is made of these terms. 1.2 Invisibility of women Feminist concerns, however, go beyond mere classificatory ones. Feminists have also argued that <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>terms like ‘he’ and ‘man’ contribute to making women invisible</u></span></span> — that is, to obscuring women's importance, and distracting attention from their existence. Fighting the invisibility of women is an important feminist project in many areas,[1] and language that makes one less likely to think of women clearly contributes to this invisibility. There is good psycholinguistic evidence that those who encounter sentences (like (3) and (4)) using the terms ‘<span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>he’ and ‘man’ think more readily of males than of females</u></span></span>.[2] If this is right, then the use of these words can be seen as contributing to the invisibility of women. This gives feminists a good reason to object to the ‘gender-neutral’ use of these terms. 1.3 Maleness as norm If one's only worry concerned the obscuring of women's presence, however, it would be difficult to object to certain other terms to which feminists do commonly object: gender-specific occupational terms like ‘manageress’ (still common in the UK, though not in the US) or ‘lady doctor’. These terms certainly do not contribute to the invisibility of women. Instead, they call attention to the presence of women. Moreover, they call attention to women's presence in positions of authority — doctor and manager. Nonetheless, most feminists who think about language find these terms objectionable. <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>The clearest reason for objecting to ‘manageress’ and ‘lady doctor’ is that the use of these terms seems premised on the idea that maleness is the norm, and that women filling these jobs are somehow deviant versions of doctors and managers</u></span></span>. This is also a key objection to the use of ‘he’ and ‘man’. Moulton (1981a) understands these terms on the model of brand names, like ‘Hoover’ or ‘Scotch tape’ that become generic terms for a product type. The message of such terms, she suggests, is that the brand in question is the best, or at least the norm. According to Moulton, terms like ‘he’ and ‘man’ work in the same manner: they are gender-specific terms for men whose use has been extended to cover both men and women. This, Moulton argues, carries the message that maleness is the norm. As a result, <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><u>the use of these terms as if they were gender neutral constitutes a sort of symbolic insult to women</u></span></span>. </span></strong> <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Alt – reject the aff’s gendered language.
