<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Building a passenger rail network........</span> rather than on the chances of securing a lucrative federal match<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>



**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The federal government should invest in high speed rail. Doing so creates a stable market, invigorates private investment, and overcomes current obstacles. Only a federal approach mobilizes a mega-regional focus to complete rails</span>**
