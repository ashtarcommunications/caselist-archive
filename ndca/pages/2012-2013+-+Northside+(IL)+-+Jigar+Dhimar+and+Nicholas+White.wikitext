=NOTE= 
This is a temporary team because Nick's normal partner, Aidan, will be unable to attend New Trier. As such, much of what we might read on the negative may not match up with what Aidan and Nick will read on neg, nor may it necessarily align with what Jigar and his partner (to be announced) will read on neg. Take all disclosure on this page with a grain of salt. If you would like cites, submit requests to Nick at nrwscigeek@gmail.com. We will always post the 1NC strat and denote the 2NR; on our separate wiki pages we will put up neg cites as requested.
=Affirmative= 
Cites will go up after our first aff round.
