<span style="font-size: 12px;">First, asteroid materials can provide scientists with clues about how the solar system was created and, in turn, help us learn how life started on Earth. </span><strong><u>Asteroids may</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 12px;">also </span><strong><u>become valuable sources of metals, minerals, gases and even water that can be used as future resources.

 <strong>Connexion Energy 6-8</strong>-11 [Connexion Energy Solutions are electrical and energy-based business service providers, “Rare Earth Metals: The Electrical Industry`s Newest `Issue`,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.environmental-expert.com/news/rare-earth-metals-the-electrical-industry-s-newest-issue-242193" rel="nofollow">http://www.environmental-expert.com/news/rare-earth-metals-the-electrical-industry-s-newest-issue-242193</a>]<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px;">It seems that every year there’s a supply / demand issue our industry is faced with. Last year was the infamous ‘ballast shortage’ due to the world wide electronic component shortage. </span><strong><u>This year we may be seeing a new issue rearing its ugly head; the shortage of 'rare earth' metals. Rare earth metals are a group of 17 elements that are used in a wide range of products we use every day, including iPhones, hard drives, hybrid cars and wind turbines</u></strong>.<span style="font-size: 12px;"> If you're a business person and currently not interested in hybrid cars or wind turbines - you might be interested in fluorescent lamps. A major manufacturer of compact fluorescent lamps has recently announced a 15 percent price increase due to the 'increase phosphors used in fluorescent lamps. </span><strong><u>This year the cost of phosphor has gone up nearly 900% and continues to rise'</u></strong><span style="font-size: 12px;">. These phosphors are a byproduct of our rare earth minerals. </span><strong><u>China has become a leading producer of rare earth metals - which leads us to today's situation, where China now produces an enormous 97 percent of the world's rare earth supply</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. As you may have guessed, </span><strong><u>having a single source for the world's need may lead to problems if something happened to that source</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. Well, that is exactly what is happening. What follows here is an article written by Joe Salimando addressing China's control of the rare earth market and its impact on our industry. </span><br />

 <strong>Parthemore ’11</strong> [Christine, Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, “Elements of Security: Mitigating the Risks of U.S. Dependence on Critical Minerals,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_Minerals_Parthemore_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_Minerals_Parthemore_1.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12px;">The defense industrial base in the modern era differs greatly from any previous time. Often, actual scarcity is not required for problems to arise, as </span><strong><u>concerns about future scarcities often drive countries to behave as if shortages are occurring</u></strong><span style="font-size: 12px;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8px;">The National Academies recently reported, “The risk of supply interruption arguably has increased or, at the very least, has become different from the more traditional threats associated with the more familiar ideas of war and conflict.” 14 During World War I and World War II, for example, governments counted on domestic steel production – and even civilian willingness to contribute scrap materials for reuse and recycling – for tanks and other equipment. In contrast, modern warfare relies on globalized and privatized supply chains rather than a primarily domestic (and often government-run) network. </span><strong><u>Vulnerability to mineral supply disruptions is</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8px;">likewise </span><strong><u>far broader and more complicated than it was in previous eras</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. Policymakers should also consider minerals that play uniquely important roles in the American economy. </span><strong><u>Rare earths</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">, for example, </span><strong><u>are important in petroleum refining, which today enables the smooth functioning of the economy. Looking to the longer term, much concern is turning toward minerals that may see booming demand as the economy develops a greater reliance on energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, such as the lithium used in advanced batteries and hybrid and electric vehicles. These minerals will directly affect U.S. economic competitiveness, and plans for improving economic growth and job development</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. This vulnerability is not a new concern. Since the early 1900s, </span><strong><u>U.S. defense analysts and national policymakers have worried about U.S. vulnerabilities to supply disruptions of the minerals critical to manufacturing defense systems, from tanks and munitions to communications equipment</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. These concerns were generally heightened in wartime. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil embargo and related oil crises of the 1970s further brought into question the assumption that the United States could depend on imports, as it became apparent that </span><strong><u>broader global conditions and political decisions by other countries could dramatically hinder the U.S. ability to openly purchase sufficient commodities at affordable costs. This conclusion was reinforced when supply disruptions and threats of disruptions by apartheid-era South Africa, the hostile Soviet Union and its satellites led to a wave of congressional hearings, government reports and independent analysis of the conditions contributing to U.S. vulnerability</u></strong>.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9px;">As of early 2010, the United States has a rapidly growing population of 308 million.33 In the 1990s, U.S. population expanded by nearly 33 million, the largest single decade of growth in American history since the decennial national censuses began in 1790. The 1990s exceeded even the peak decade of the Baby Boom, the 1950s by nearly five million (Figure 7). The 2001-</span><strong><u>2010</u></strong><span style="font-size: 11px;"> decade </span><strong><u>now drawing to a close will approach this record increment</u></strong><u>.</u><span style="font-size: 9px;">Far from coasting to a stop or cessation in growth, U.S. population remains stubbornly and persistently high, and is literally growing with no end in sight. At current growth rates, every year more than three million net new residents are added to the U.S. population.34 The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2050, the population of the United States will have grown to 439 million. This is an increase of 131 million, or 43 percent, over our current population of 308 million. In 2050, if the Census Bureau’s current projections come to pass, the U.S. population would still be adding 3.45 million residents a year (more than today, though the annual growth rate will have declined somewhat), and there would be 5.7 million births compared to 4.3 million annual births today.35 Yet </span><strong><u>it is misleading to imply that increased births would be the dominant force behind this massive population growth</u></strong><u>.</u><span style="font-size: 9px;">That is because many of those births would not occur, or at least would not occur in the United States, were it not for the persistently high levels of net immigration that are assumed by the Census Bureau in these projections. In 2050, the Bureau’s projections assume “net international migration” (immigration minus emigration) of 2.05 million, an increase from 1.34 million in 2010. </span><strong><u>This</u></strong><strong><u>assumption reflects the Bureau’s professional judgment that domestic and international pressures to further increase already high immigration rates will only intensify</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. If the factors behind demographic change are divided between “net natural increase” (births minus deaths) and “net migration” (immigration minus emigration), then in 2050, 41 percent of the annual increment of 3.45 million would be attributable to net natural increase, and 59 percent would be due to net migration. However, even this breakdown understates the decisive influence that the level of immigration has in determining America’s demographic future. </span><strong><u>The full impact of immigration on demographic trends only becomes apparent when the U.S.-born descendents of immigrants are accounted for because, after all, these U.S. births would not have occurred but for the prior acts of migration</u></strong><span style="font-size: 11px;"> by eventual parents that made them possible. </span><strong><u>When births to immigrants are accounted for, demographers at the Pew Research Center calculated</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">recently that: If current trends continue, the population of the United States will rise to 438 millionin 2050, from 296 million in 2005, and 82 percent of the increase will be due to immigrants arriving from 2005 to 2050 and their U.S.-born descendants.36 [emphasis added] Figures 8-10 graphically illustrate the powerful role of immigration policy in shaping current and future U.S. demographic trends. Figure 8 shows U.S. population growth from 1790 to 1970; the steepening curve, one characterized by larger and larger increments over time is a shape characteristic of all phenomena experiencing exponential growth. If, however, the 1970 levels of demographic components (net immigration, fertility or birth rates, and mortality rates) had been maintained over the decades that followed, the growth trajectory would have appeared more like that of the curve in Figure 9, rather than the much steeper curve in Figure 8. At the time of the first celebration of Earth Day in 1970, young environmentalists who had just finished reading Paul Ehrlich’s best-selling 1968 book The Population Bomb and listening to one of Earth Day Founder Senator Gaylord Nelson’s moving speeches believed whole-heartedly in the cause and necessity of U.S. and global population stabilization. They endorsed the view of popular cartoonist Walt Kelly’s character Pogo that, “We have met the enemy and he is us” (a play on words of the famous line by Commodore Perry: “We have met the enemy, and they are ours”). In other words, the more of “us” there are, the more “enemies,” or at least environmental burdens Mother Earth faces. If this generation had been able to realize its vision of slowing and then stopping U.S. population growth and reining in the environmental degradation it caused, the trajectory might have looked something like that of the curve in Figure 9. Growth would have tapered off and America’s population would never have hit 300 million. Instead, because of the rapidly rising wave of immigration unleashed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, Americans and their environment are facing the grim, and utterly unsustainable, future of ever-greater demographic pressures represented by Figure 10. What bearing do these “inconvenient truths” have on America’s Ecological Footprint? In a nutshell — everything. Current immigration levels are enlarging the already enormous U.S. Ecological Footprint and ecological deficit. With the U.S. population booming by more than 10 percent a decade, the only way to maintain — much less reduce the current, unacceptable size of our EF is to reduce our per capita consumption every decade by more than 10 percent — not just for one or five decades, but indefinitely, for as long as population growth continues. One doesn’t have to be a physicist or a political scientist to recognize that an achievement of this magnitude would be technically and politically unrealistic, if not impossible. America is already in ecological overshoot, and massive population growth driven by high immigration rates only serves to exacerbate the situation. Figure 11 shows current trends with respect to the Ecological Footprint and Biocapacity of the United States from 1961 through 2006.37 As is evident from the crossing lines in this graph, America’s EF first surpassed its biocapacity in the late 1960s, just prior to the first Earth Day. Since then the gap or ecological deficit has only continued to widen. While the addition of each new American does not necessarily increase our per capita or per person (as opposed to our aggregate) EF — only increased per capita resource consumption and CO2 generation does that, it does directly decrease our per capita biocapacity, and thus increases our ecological deficit. Population growth does this in two ways. First,</span><strong><u>given a fixed biocapacity</u></strong><span style="font-size: 11px;"> — that is, a land base that is demonstrably finite and constant, with fixed maximum acreages of potential cropland, grazing land, forestland, and fishing grounds — </span><strong><u>it is a simple mathematical reality that adding more people</u></strong><span style="font-size: 11px;"> who depend on this ecologically productive land base </span><strong><u>reduces per capita biocapacity</u></strong><span style="font-size: 11px;">. Second, </span><strong><u>the more than three million new Americans added every year require space and area in which to live, work, play, shop, and attend school</u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 19px;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8px;">As open space is converted into the “built-up land” category, some combination of forestland, cropland, and grazing land is inevitably developed. (In the 1950s, Orange County, California, home to Disneyland, was touted by developers as “Smog Free Orange County,” but by the 1990s, after four decades of relentless sprawl development to accommodate Southern California’s multiplying millions, it became known as “Orange Free Smog County”). In this way, our country’s biocapacity is steadily and inexorably diminished by a growing population. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service’s (NRCS’s) National Resources Inventory (NRI) estimated that the United States lost 44 million acres of cropland, 12 million acres of pastureland, and 11 million acres of rangeland from 1982 to 1997, for a total loss to our agricultural land base of 67 million acres over this 15-year period.38 (One explanation of the much higher acreage of lost cropland than pastureland and rangeland was that a larger fraction of the cropland acreage was not “lost” per se, but deliberately “retired” from active production into the so-called Conservation Reserve Program or CRP, a program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency. These were lands of marginal quality and high erodibility, lands on which modern, intensive agriculture is unsustainable). All 49 states inventoried lost cropland. Overall cropland losses continued in the next NRI published in 2007.39 The impacts of the loss of this land extend beyond agriculture. The USDA has estimated that each person added to the U.S. population requires slightly more than one acre of land for urbanization and highways.40 Clearly, more land is required as more people are added to our population. A comparison of NRI acreage — 25 million acres of newly developed land over the 1982-1997 period and 67 million acres of agricultural land lost shows that development per se is not responsible for all or even half of agricultural land loss. Arable land is also subject to other natural and manmade phenomena such as soil erosion (from both water and wind), salinization, and waterlogging that can rob its fertility, degrade its productivity and eventually force its retirement or increase its dependency on ever greater quantities of costly inputs like (fossil-fuel derived) nitrogen fertilizers. Arguably, however, much of these losses are due to over-exploitation by intensive agricultural practices needed to constantly raise agricultural productivity (yield per acre) in order to provide ever more food for America’s and the world’s growing populations and meat-rich diets. Thus, the potent combination of relentless development and land degradation from soil erosion and other factors is reducing America’s productive agricultural land base even as the demands on that same land base from a growing population are increasing. If the rates of agricultural land loss that have prevailed in recent years were to continue to 2050, the nation will have lost 53 million of its remaining 377 million acres of cropland, or 14 percent, even as the U.S. population grows by 43 percent from 308 million to 440 million.41 Continuing on to 2100, the discrepancy between booming population numbers and declining cropland acreage widens even further (Figure 12). The Census Bureau’s “middle series” projection (made in the year 2000) is 571 million, more than a doubling of U.S. population in 2000.42 (The “highest serious” projection was 1.2 billion, and actual growth since these projections were made has been between the middle and highest series). If the same rate of cropland loss were to continue, the United States would lose approximately 106 million acres of its remaining 377 million acres of cropland, or nearly 30 percent. Cropland per capita, that is, the acreage of land to grow grains and other crops for each resident, would decline from 1.4 acres in 1997 to 0.47 acres in 2100, a 66 percent reduction. If this occurs, biotechnology will need to work miracles to raise yields per acre in order to maintain the sort of diet Americans have come to expect. These</span><strong><u>ominous, divergent trends</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 11px;">— an increasing population and declining arable land, have actually </span><strong><u>led some scientists to think</u></strong><span style="font-size: 11px;">the unthinkable: that one day </span><strong><u>America may no longer be able to feed itself, let alone boast a food surplus for export</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">to the world. In the 1990s, Cornell University agricultural and food scientists David and Marcia Pimentel and Mario Giampietro of the Istituto Nazionale della Nutrizione in Rome, Italy, argued that by approximately 2025, the United States would most likely cease to be a food exporter, and that food grown in this country would be needed for domestic consumption. These findings suggest that by 2050, the amount of arable land per capita may have dropped to the point that, “the diet of the average American will, of necessity, include more grains, legumes, tubers, fruits and vegetables, and significantly less animal products.”43 While this might, in fact, constitute a healthier diet both for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and for many calorically and cholesterol-challenged Americans, it would also represent a significant loss of dietary choice. As nations get wealthier, they tend to “move up the food chain” in the phrase of the Earth Policy Institute’s Lester Brown, that is they consume higher trophic level, more ecologically demanding and damaging meat and dairy products, but were these predictions to hold true, Americans, for better or worse, would be moving in the opposite direction. From 2005 to 2006, the U.S. per capita ecological deficit widened from 10.9 to 11.3 acres, continuing the long-term trend depicted in Figure 11. Assuming the Census Bureau’s official population projections for 2050 actually do happen, the U.S. population would be 43 percent larger than at present. Even if there were no further increase in the U.S. per capita EF, which is, as can be seen from the 45-year trend in Figure 11, a rather generous assumption, a 43 percent increase in the U.S. population would correspond to a further 43 percent reduction in biocapacity per capita, even without the types of continuing land and resource degradation just discussed above for cropland. The 2006 U.S. biocapacity was 10.9 global acres (ga) per capita. By 2050, if current U.S. demographic trends and projections hold, this will have been reduced to 6.2 ga per capita. If the per capita American EF of consumption were to remain at the 2006 value of 22.3 ga, the ecological deficit in 2050 would increase to 16.1 ga per capita. In essence,</span><strong><u>if we American “Bigfeet” do not opt for a different demographic path than the one we are treading now, Ecological Footprint analysis indicates unequivocally that we will continue plodding ever deeper into the forbidden zone of Ecological Overshoot, trampling our prospects for a sustainable future</u></strong><span style="font-size: 11px;">. Incidentally, </span><strong><u>we would also be trampling the survival prospects for many</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">hundreds of endangered </span><strong><u>species</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">with which we share our country. These birds, mammals, fish, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, mussels, and other taxa are menaced with extinction by our aggressive exploitation of nearly every ecological niche, nook, and cranny. In nature, no organism in overshoot remains there for long. Sooner or later, </span><strong><u>ecosystem and/or population collapse ensues</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Are we humans, because of our unique scientific acumen, immune from the laws of nature that dictate the implacable terms of existence to all other species on the planet? Our political, economic, and cultural elites seem to think so, and en masse, we certainly act so. Yet ironically, </span><strong><u>many scientists themselves believe otherwise: that all-too-human hubris, unless checked by collective wisdom and self-restraint, will prove to be our undoing, and that civilization as we know it may unravel</u></strong><span style="font-size: 11px;">.44</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8px;">WORLD PEACE AND PRESERVATION OF HUMAN CIVILISATION </span><strong><u>The major source of</u></strong> social friction, including <strong><u>international friction, has surely always been unequal access to resources</u></strong>. People fight to control the valuable resources on and under the land, and in and under the sea. <strong><u>The natural resources of Earth are limited in quantity</u></strong>, and economically accessible resources even more so. <strong><u>As the population grows, and demand grows for a higher material standard of living, industrial activity grows exponentially. The threat of resources becoming scarce has led to the concept of &quot;Resource Wars&quot;</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. Having begun long ago with wars to control the gold and diamonds of Africa and South America, and oil in the Middle East, the current phase is at centre stage of world events today [27]. </span><strong><u>A particular danger of &quot;resource wars&quot; is that</u></strong>, if the general public can be persuaded to support them, <strong><u>they may become impossible to stop as resources become increasingly scarce</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. Many commentators have noted the similarity of the language of US and UK government advocates of &quot;war on terror&quot; to the language of the novel &quot;1984&quot; which describes a dystopian future of endless, fraudulent war in which citizens are reduced to slaves. Expansion into near-Earth Space is the Only Alternative to Endless &quot;Resource Wars&quot; </span><strong><u>As an alternative to the &quot;resource wars&quot; already devastating many countries today, opening access to the unlimited resources of near-Earth space could clearly facilitate world peace and security</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. This is acknowledged by the U.S. National Space Security Office, which started its 2007 report on the potential of space-based solar power: &quot;Expanding human populations and declining natural resources are potential sources of local and strategic conflict in the 21st Century, and many see energy as the foremost threat to national security&quot; [28]. It ended the report: &quot;Considering the timescales that are involved, and the exponential growth of population and resource pressures within that same strategic period, it is imperative that this work for &quot;drilling up&quot; vs. drilling down for energy security begins immediately&quot; [28]. Although the use of extra-terrestrial resources on a substantial scale may still be some decades away, </span><strong><u>it is important to recognise that simply acknowledging its feasibility using known technology is the surest way of ending the threat of resource wars</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. That is, if it is assumed that the resources available for human use are limited to those on Earth, then it can be argued that resource wars are inescapable [15, 27]. </span><strong><u>If</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">, by contrast, </span><strong><u>it is assumed that the resources of space are economically accessible, this not only eliminates the need for resource wars, it can also preserve the benefits of civilisation which are being eroded today by &quot;resource war-mongers&quot;, most notably the governments of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; countries and their &quot;neo-con&quot; advisers</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. It is also worth noting that the $1 trillion that these have already committed to the Iraq war is far more than the investment needed to access space resources. Industrial and financial groups which profit from monopolistic control of terrestrial supplies of various natural resources, like those which profit from wars, have an economic interest in protecting their profitable situation. However, these groups' continuing profits are justified neither by capitalism nor by democracy: they could be preserved only by maintaining the pretence that use of space resources is not feasible, and by preventing the development of low-cost space travel. </span><strong><u>Once the feasibility of low-cost space travel is understood, &quot;resource wars&quot; are clearly idiotic as well as tragic</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. A visiting extra-terrestrial would be pityingly amused at the foolish antics of homo sapiens using long-range rockets to fight each other over dwindling terrestrial resources - rather than using the same rockets to travel in space and have all the resources they need! </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px;">“The Pentagon has been incredibly negligent,” said Peter Leitner, who was a senior strategic trade adviser at the Defense Department from 1986 to 2007. “</span><span class="Underline"><strong>There are plenty of early warning signs that China will use its leverage over these materials as a weapon.” China may already be flexing its muscles amid a diplomatic spat with its East Asian neighbor Japan. China last week imposed a “de facto” ban on exports to Japan of the metals used in liquid crystal displays and laptop computers</strong></span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, Japanese Economy Minister Banri Kaieda said Sept. 28. That followed Japan’s detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain whose ship collided with two Japanese Coast Guard vessels. Japan later released the man. No such ban exists, China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesman Chen Rongkai said. New Factor “What it does, clearly, is bring a new factor into the consideration of supply of critical materials,” said Dudley Kingsnorth, director of Industrial Minerals Co. of Australia, a forecaster in Perth. </span><span class="Underline"><strong>The U.S. Congress’s investigative arm, the Government Accountability Office, in April warned of “vulnerabilities” for the military because of the lack of domestic rare-earth supplies</strong></span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. The House of Representatives Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing in October, the same month a Pentagon report on how to secure future supplies of the metals is due. “The department has long recognized that rare-earth elements are important raw material inputs for many defense systems and that many companies in our base have expressed concern regarding the future availability of the refined products of these elements,” Brett Lambert, director of the Pentagon’s Office of Industrial Policy, said. While two rare-earth projects are scheduled to ramp up production by the end of 2012 -- one owned by Molycorp Inc. in California and another by Lynas Corp. in Australia -- the GAO says it may take 15 years to rebuild a U.S. manufacturing supply chain. China makes virtually all the metals refined from rare earths, the agency says. The elements are also needed for hybrid-electric cars and wind turbines, one reason supply may fall short of demand in 2014 even with the new mines, according to Kingsnorth of Imcoa. Doggy Day Care Just how far U.S. manufacturing has waned is apparent at a factory in Valparaiso, Indiana, where dogs skitter across a bare concrete shop floor, their nails clicking. This brick plant on Elm Street once made 80 percent of the rare-earth magnets in laser-guided U.S. smart bombs, according to U.S. Senator Evan Bayh, a Democrat from Indiana. In 2003, the plant’s owner shifted work to China, costing 230 jobs. Now the plant houses Coco’s Canine Cabana, a doggy day care the current tenants started to supplement sagging income from their machine shop. On most days dogs outnumber the 15 metalworkers, said Kathy DeFries, co-owner of Excel Machine Technologies Inc. “When things got slow for manufacturing, we had this big empty shop floor,” said DeFries, nuzzling a floppy-eared puppy. “It’s a great stress reliever.” Expensive to Mine The rare earths are chemically similar elements, with names such as yttrium and dysprosium. China has the largest share of worldwide reserves, about 36 percent, and the U.S. is second, with 13 percent, the U.S. Geological Survey says. While the elements aren’t rare, they’re less frequently found in profitable concentrations, expensive for Western producers to extract and often laced with radioactive elements. China produced 120,000 tons, or 97 percent, of the world’s 124,000-ton supply last year, according to the GAO. Half of that came from Baotou, said Kingsnorth. The raw elements have many applications. Neodymium is used by Chinese companies including magnet makers, who sell to U.S. suppliers of defense contractors. Export Quotas Export quotas and taxes for overseas buyers that the GAO says can reach 25 percent are pushing up prices of elements even in relatively large supply. For example, the cost of a kilogram of samarium powder, needed for the navigation system of General Dynamics’ M1A2 Abrams tank, jumped to $34 in early September, from $4.50 in June, according to U.K. researcher Metal Pages Ltd. </span><span class="Underline"><strong>The U.S. and the European Union consider Chinese restrictions on a range of raw goods part of a strategy to draw in higher-paying manufacturing jobs by making them cheaper to buy inside China. The export taxes violate World Trade Organization rules because China pledged to limit them to 84 product categories when it joined the trade group in 2001</strong>, said Terence Stewart, managing partner of Washington law firm Stewart &amp; Stewart. In 2010, China had taxes on 329, he said. <strong>The U.S. and the EU filed a WTO complaint over raw materials including bauxite and coke last year</strong></span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. China’s commerce minister, Chen Deming, said Aug. 28 that the policies comply with WTO rules. Some manufacturers in China are lobbying the ministry to back off the latest quotas because a dispute will disrupt the market, said Constantine Karayannopoulos, chief executive officer of Toronto-based Neo Material Technologies Inc., which has rare-earth production facilities in China. Risk of Trade War </span><span class="Underline"><strong>“It was very sudden and didn’t give the industry any time to adjust,” he said. “This quota action could risk a trade war</strong><strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">.</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 9px;">” For Western companies, China’s policies are creating the real “unobtanium,” the fictional mineral fought over in James Cameron’s 2009 film “Avatar.” It’s taking as long as 10 weeks to get neodymium magnets, double the previous wait time, said Joe Schrantz, group supply chain manager at Moog Inc. in East Aurora, New York. He said </span><span class="Underline"><strong>the company buys hundreds of thousands of magnets a year to make motors for cars, trucks and weapons including Raytheon’s AMRAAM</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 9px;">-- or Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile -- </span><span class="Underline"><strong>and Boeing’s Joint Direct Attack Munition, a tail fin kit for making precision-guided “smart” bombs out of ordinary weapons</strong>.</span><br />

In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore.</span> <u>If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire</u><span style="font-size: 11px;">. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order.</span> <u>With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe’s political landscape.

In south Asia, </span><u>hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase</u>. <span style="font-size: 9px;">Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its “non first use” principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass,</span> <u>we would see <strong>the</strong> <strong>destruction of civilisation</strong>. There <strong>would be no victors in such a war</strong></u>. <span style="font-size: 11px;">While the prospect of a</span> <strong><u>nuclear Armaggedon</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 11px;">over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it </span><u>cannot be ruled out entirely</u>, <span style="font-size: 11px;">for </span><u>China puts sovereignty above everything else</u>.<br />

<strong><u>Most of the world's concentrated rare earth deposits being mined today are located in China. Rare earth mines in North America and other places have either never been developed or have been shut down because they could not compete with China's lower production costs</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. As you can imagine, Japanese high-tech industries require rare earth elements as raw materials. It's very difficult to produce electronics, especially those involving magnets or batteries – such as the Toyota Prius hybrid car –without them. With China supplying 97% of the world's rare earth elements, Japan cannot afford to lose trade relations with China. So it's no surprise that, following the threat of an embargo, Japan released the fishing boat captain. We think </span><strong><u>the incident is the first skirmish in what may be a protracted period of mercantilist activities – if not an all-out war for resources. The reason Japan and China both insist asserting sovereignty over the particular stretch of the East China Sea is that the area is rich in undersea natural gas deposits – another vital resource</u></strong>. Of course <strong><u>these days</u></strong>, <strong><u>demand for virtually every natural resource used by industrial societies is close to exceeding what's available</u></strong><span style="font-size: 11px;">. Even iron ore supplies are being stretched thin by the massive construction efforts taking place in the developing world, and especially China. Of course, just mining and processing iron into steel requires large amounts of energy and other resources, which are consequently suffering from supply constraints as well. The squeeze is even greater for copper, which is less plentiful than iron but just as essential for construction and energy transmission. </span><strong><u>In order to secure the resources they need in coming years, nations around the world are likely to undergo a New Age of Mercantilism in which they try to hoard their natural resources so they can continue to produce more valuable exports</u></strong><span style="font-size: 11px;">.

<strong><u>U.S. military technologies such as guided bombs and night vision rely heavily upon rare earth elements supplied by China, and rebuilding an independent U.S. supply chain to wean the country off that foreign dependency could take up to 15 years</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">, according to a new report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). Both &quot;light&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot; rare earth elements represent a family of minerals found in commercial products ranging from TV displays to cell phones, as well as green technologies such as hybrid electric motors and wind turbines. For example, the rare earth element neodymium is very magnetic and is used in everything from computer hard drives to wind turbines and Toyota's Prius hybrid car. The GAO report – a draft of which was obtained by TechNewsDaily – was meant to look at national security risks that could arise from dependency upon rare earth elements. </span>&quot;<strong><u>Defense systems will likely continue to depend on rare earth materials, based on their life cycles and lack of effective substitutes</u></strong>,&quot; the GAO reported. <strong><u>New rare earth mines in the U.S., Australia, Canada and South Africa won't start up until at least 2014, based on industry estimates</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. The GAO report listed rare earth deposits in states that include California, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Missouri and Utah. But looking beyond the GAO report reveals that </span><strong><u>many U.S. deposits lack the &quot;heavy&quot; rare earth elements critical for much of today's technological innovations. Another cause for concern: Chinese corporations have also begun investing in mining companies that hold certain U.S. deposits</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. The U.S. once supplied most of the global supply of rare earth elements, and also manufactured rare earth products such as the neodymium magnets. But rare earth processing has largely shifted to China since the 1990s. Even if the U.S. resumes mining its rare earth deposits and begins converting rare earth ore into oxides, it lacks the facilities for converting rare earth oxides into refined metals. China has set quotas limiting rare earth exports and added on export taxes, despite supplying as much as 97 percent of the world's rare earth oxides. It even warned in an official plan for 2009-2015 that its own industrial demand might force it to stop exporting entirely. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>America's national security requirements dictate that the armed forces must be prepared to defeat groups of adversaries in a given war</strong></span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. America, as the sole remaining superpower, has many enemies. Because attacking America or its interests alone would surely end in defeat for a single nation, these enemies are likely to form alliances. Therefore, basing readiness on American military superiority over any single nation has little saliency. The evidence indicates that the U.S. armed forces are not ready to support America's national security requirements. Moreover, regarding the broader capability to defeat groups of enemies, military readiness has been declining. The National Security Strategy, the U.S. official statement of national security objectives,3 concludes that the United States &quot;must have the capability to deter and, if deterrence fails, defeat large-scale, cross-border aggression in two distant theaters in overlapping time frames.&quot;4 According to some of the military's highest-ranking officials, however, the United States cannot achieve this goal. Commandant of the Marine Corps General James Jones, former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay Johnson, and Air Force Chief of Staff General Michael Ryan have all expressed serious concerns about their respective services' ability to carry out a two major theater war strategy.5 Recently retired Generals Anthony Zinni of the U.S. Marine Corps and George Joulwan of the U.S. Army have even questioned America's ability to conduct one major theater war the size of the 1991 Gulf War.6 </span><span class="Underline"><strong>Military readiness is vital because declines in America's military readiness signal to the rest of the world that the United States is not prepared to defend its interests</strong></span><span style="font-size: 8px;">.

<u>What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? Even if it fails, it would further exacerbate the negative features of the new and frightening world in which we are now living. Societies would close in on themselves, police measures would be stepped up at the expense of human rights, tensions between civilisations and religions would rise and ethnic conflicts would proliferate. It would also speed up the arms race and develop the awareness that a different type of world order is imperative if humankind is to survive. But the still more critical scenario <strong>is if the attack succeeds</strong>. This could <strong>lead to a third world war</strong>, from which no one will emerge victorious.

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8px;">Planets have ﬁnite natural resources. This truism has become painfully apparent to mankind in recent decades, through examples such as shrinking biodiversity and the increasing challenges facing engineers and geoscientists attempting to extract fossil fuels from the Earth. All life acts as consumers at some level, but the level of consumption is typically regulated through population control and other pressures introduced by the ecosystem . Advances in technology have allowed humans to circumvent these controls, with the effect that humans have vastly increased their population, placing strains on local resources. </span><strong><u>There has</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9px;">also </span><strong><u>been a continued increase per capita in consumption of precious metals for technologies such as computers, mobile phones and the infrastructures which enable them to function</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. The proposed green technologies of the future, such as hydrogen fuel cells and CO2 scrubbers, will only enhance this need for already rare resources (Elshkaki &amp; Van Der Voet, 2006; Schuiling &amp; Krijgsman, 2006). </span><strong><u>Such resources can be found in the asteroids</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Meteoritic analysis (Kargel, 1994), suggests that large quantities of gold, platinum and other precious metals exist in the asteroids of the Solar System, as well as large amounts of other elements such as iron, nickel, magnesium and silicon. He concludes that </span><strong><u>successful operations at modest mining rates could increase the total production rate of some materials by a factor of 10</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. By applying simple empirical models (where market value scales as the square root of production rate), approximate threefold decreases in price can also be expected, over timescales of a few decades. Indeed, </span><strong><u>if the supply of precious metals such as platinum is to continue to meet technological demands, asteroid mining may become essential within the coming century</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9px;">(Elshkaki &amp; Van Der Voet, 2006). Besides these industrially driven arguments, SETI scientists are driven by the possibility of detecting extraterrestrial intelligence by evidence of their activities in the Outer Solar System and the asteroids (Papagiannis, 1978, 1995). Developing asteroid mining technology for commercial reasons will certainly assist the implementation of studies of this nature. </span><strong><u>Humans have not begun asteroid mining primarily for reasons of political economy</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">. While the resources still exist in affordable quantities on Earth, governments lack a good short-term economic case to attempt dangerous missions at high cost to bring back what would initially be modest quantities of raw materials. As Hickman (1999) observes, asteroid miners should not expect immediate investment from private investors either. </span><strong><u>While the potential return from successful, properly matured asteroid mining missions is very large, the level of capital required up front for any large-scale space project is also very large</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 11px;">- </span><strong><u>Schmitt</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 11px;">(1997) optimistically </span><strong><u>estimates a sum of around $15bn for general commercial space enterprise</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 11px;">(assuming fusion technologies based on lunar 3 He become proﬁtable, and not considering the problems presented by the current ﬁnancial landscape). Further to this, the maturation time period (before proﬁts can be generated) is too long, i.e. greater than 5 years. Other large-scale space projects (such as Martian colonisation) are equally unappealing for investors looking for returns on their investments within a decade - Hickman (1999) gives a simpliﬁed example which shows that if Mars can be terraformed in less than a thousand years, even a modest rate of interest on an initial loan requires Martian real estate to be extremely expensive. While there might not be a good short-term economic case for governments to fund TAM missions, there are long-term economic and political motivations (see Gerlach 2005 for a thorough review). </span><strong><u>If the initial high capital barrier can be overcome, and proﬁts can be generated, then manufacturing future technologies will become much cheaper as the precious metals become less precious. The expertise gained by designing and undertaking TAM missions can then be brought to bear on other challenges in space exploration</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Given the hazards involved in TAM for atmosphere-breathing species, it is reasonable to assume that much of the process will become automated and autonomous, ushering in a new era of robotics with advanced decision-making and goal-seeking software (which has obvious implications for post-biological evolution). With a large surplus of raw materials and a skilled robotic workforce, large, permanent space habitats can be constructed, for example in geostationary orbit. This may allow the construction of the long-considered “space elevator” (cf Aravind 2007), greatly reducing the cost of space-travel in general. With much cheaper space exploration, the ﬁnancial risks are reduced for other large-scale space projects, facilitating capital investment and Man’s continued development into a space-faring species.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 13px;">The first activity is an investigation into the current legal framework to identify the challenges that apply to asteroid mining. </span><strong><u>Gaining wide acceptance for legitimate asteroid mining using current space law would be the easiest, most desirable goal. This activity will conclude with the identification of key areas that require new legislation to allow asteroid mining activities</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. For example, the current legal framework sufficiently covers registration of an asteroid placed into Low Earth Orbit and liability concerns. Conversely, </span><strong><u>appropriation will be problematic without new legislation clarifying the way ahead</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Following this investigation, the development of new legislation is required. <strong><u>This</u></strong> </span><strong><u>legislation shall be in place before a private entity invests significantly in an asteroid mining mission.

While other preparatory activities towards a successful asteroid mining mission can occur concurrently, </span><strong><u>financing may not be forthcoming from a commercial entity based on hopes that new legislation will exist at a future date</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Another alternative is that a private entity chooses to conduct asteroid mining prior to completion of the legislative framework. In this instance</span>, <strong><u>the private entity must accept greater risks in the venture to avoid delaying asteroid mining activities. The new legislation will clarify existing space law to allow asteroid mining activities for the benefit of humankind</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8px;">. Specifically, the new legislation will cover the elements of jurisdiction, appropriation, liability, and distribution. A description of these elements follows.

Senator Murkowski’s bill, ‘S.1113: Critical Mineral Policy Act of 2011,’ requires that the government “identifies and quantifies known critical mineral resources, using all available public and private information… provides a quantitative and qualitative assessment of undiscovered critical mineral resources throughout the United States.” </span><strong><u>The main obstacle to mining firms in the US is a long and complex permitting process that often takes ten years to accomplish. The ability of the mining companies to react to shifts in the commodity cycle and demands from new technology is hampered by the permitting process</u></strong><span style="font-size: 11px;">. Murkowski’s bill addresses the need to change permitting regulations, ”to encourage Federal agencies to facilitate the availability, development, and environmentally responsible production of domestic resources to meet national critical minerals needs; to minimize duplication, needless paperwork, and delays in the administration of applicable laws (including regulations) and the issuance of permits.” </span><strong><u>The permitting process often puts US mining projects at a serious disadvantage. “If commodity cycles are historically 20 years in duration, the 10 years it takes to obtain permits leaves U.S. mining still in the starting blocks with the race half way over</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">,” stated Hal Quinn, CEO of the National Mining Association. </span>
