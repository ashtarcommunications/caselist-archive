**But instead of taking responsibility for these injustices, the status quo is waging war on the Okinawans, treating them as objects to be manipulated by political elites**

==Irony Aff- New Trier Finals== 

**<span style="color: black;">Contention 1, the res is a joke:</span>**

**<span style="color: black;">Subpoint A is NOKO</span>**

**<span style="color: black;">The upcoming Kim Jong Il power handoff will completely destabilize East Asia, Kim Jong-un is shaping up to be nuttier than his father, US forces are necessary to ensure backhanding </span>**
**<span style="color: black;">Theonion 11/1</span>**<span style="color: black;">/ 2010 (“Kim Jong-Un Privately Doubting He's Crazy Enough To Run North Korea” </span>__<span style="color: blue;">http://www.theonion.com/articles/kim-jongun-privately-doubting-hes-crazy-enough-to,18374/</span>__<span style="color: black;">)</span>
<span style="color: black;">In surprisingly candid remarks Thursday, __Kim Jong-un, heir apparent to North Korea's highest government post, expressed doubt that he was sufficiently out of his mind to succeed his father__, longtime dictator Kim Jong-il.</span>
<span style="color: black;">While __emphasizing that he was definitely completely insane and would likely be even less stable by the time he assumed power, the younger Kim nevertheless wondered if he could ever be enough of a lunatic__ to replace the most unhinged leader on the planet. "Obviously, I know I was handpicked because I'm super crazy," said Kim, the youngest of the 69-year-old dictator's four known children. "But my father's just so great at what he does. Did you know the people of North Korea have heard his voice exactly once, for like five seconds? How nuts is that? Honestly, I look at stuff like that and I think, __'Wow, there's just no way I can ever top Dad.'"__ "__We're talking about a world-class nutjob here," he added.__ Kim told reporters that since emerging as the presumptive next-in-line to lead North Korea, __he had spent countless hours trying to come up with his own brand of craziness that would honor the tradition set forth by his father and grandfather__, Kim Il-sung, but would also set him apart. After discovering that many of his best ideas had already been taken by his father—including making citizens bow toward wall-sized portraits of himself or claiming to be a demigod whose moods directly influence the weather—Kim admitted he had grown frustrated. "At this point, __I'm not sure what's left for me to do, really,"__ he said. "I mean, according to the Ministry of Information, __Dad hit 11 holes-in-one the first time he ever played golf. I'm dead serious. Dad had never even picked up a golf club before, and he hit 38 under par.__ Where am I supposed to go from there? __I guess I can say I ran a marathon in 20 minutes, but isn't that pretty much the same thing?"__ "It is the same thing, isn't it?" Kim added. "Ugh." __Kim__, who in his rare public appearances wears a plain dark suit, said __he ultimately hoped to cultivate an eccentric,__ yet __vaguely sinister look__ as iconic as his father's pompadour, drab parka, and sunglasses, __perhaps something "even nuttier" involving canes, a large yellow raincoat, or possibly a motorized scooter.__ Other ideas Kim has had for proving his insanity include placing anyone shorter than himself under permanent house arrest, issuing a new national currency every 90 days, normalizing relations with South Korea, and replacing all medicines with synthetic replications of his own saliva. "Of course, __I have to be careful not to come off as too crazy, because then it would just feel forced and no one would buy it,__" said Kim, noting that he was working on some slogans that North Korean schoolchildren would be forced to chant three times daily. "Then again, maybe having it come off as forced would make me seem even crazier, because what kind of a maniac would go to such lengths to outdo his father? Right? Or is that just a cop-out?" Although Kim's birthday is already recognized as a national holiday and any criticism of him is punishable by indefinite sentences in re-education camps, Kim suggested that the stress of living up to his father's insanity had been taking a toll. __"I can't even enjoy the things I used to love, like forcing starving people to perform a five-hour dance routine in my honor, because I spend the whole time obsessing over whether I'm being wacko enough__," Kim admitted. "That's what's so special about Dad, you know: He never worries about all that stuff, he just acts like himself. What can I say? The old man set the loony bar pretty high." __When asked if he planned to consult the elder Kim for advice, the future leader said that while his father would almost certainly have valuable insights, the man was far too crazy for even a lunatic like himself to speak to.__ __"But I've got to prove myself to him somehow," Kim said. "He'll kill me if I don't."__</span>


**<span style="color: black;">This provocation prompts China, Japan and the Koreas to go batshit crazy and throw nukes around like it’s a hot pocket fresh out the microwave, culminating in extinction. So it goes.</span>**
**<span style="color: black;">Kang 2k3. </span>**<span style="color: black;">David Kang, Professor of International Relations and Business, Director of Korean Studies Institute, Getting Asia Wrong: The Need for New Analytical Frameworks International Security, Volume 27, Number 4, Spring 2003, pg. 57-85 muse</span>
<span style="color: black;">Following the end of the Cold War in 1991, __some scholars in the West began to predict that Asia was “ripe for rivalry__.”12 __They based this prediction on the fol- lowing factors: wide disparities in the levels of economic and military power among nations in the region__; their __different political systems__, ranging from democratic to totalitarian; historical animosities; and the lack of international institutions. Many __scholars__ thus __envisaged a return of power politics__ after de- cades when conoict in Asia was dominated by the Cold War tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. In addition, __scholars envisaged a re- turn of arms racing and the possibility of major conflict__ among Asian coun- tries, almost all of which had rapidly changing internal and external environments. More __specific predictions included the growing possibility of Japanese rearmament__;13 increased __Chinese adventurism__ spurred by China’s rising power and ostensibly revisionist intentions;14 __conflict__ or war __over__ the status of __Taiwan;__15 terrorist __or__ __missile attacks from__ a rogue __North Korea__ against South Korea, Japan, or even the United States;16 and arms racing or even conoict in Southeast Asia, prompted in part by unresolved territorial disputes.17 __More than a dozen years have passed since the end of the Cold War, yet none of these pessimistic predictions have come to pass__**.** Indeed there has not been a major war in Asia since the 1978–79 Vietnam-Cambodia-China conoict; and with only a few exceptions (North Korea and Taiwan), __Asian countries do not fear for their survival__. __Japan__, though powerful, __has not rearmed to the extent it could__. __China seems no more revisionist or adventurous now than it was before the end of the Cold War__. And no Asian country appears to be balancing against China. In contrast to the period 1950–80, the past two decades have witnessed enduring regional stability and minimal conoict. Scholars should directly confront these anomalies, rather than dismissing them. Social scientists can learn as much from events that do not occur as from those that do. __The case of Asian security provides an opportunity to examine the usefulness of accepted international relations paradigms and to determine how the assumptions underlying these theories can become misspeciaed__. Some scholars have smuggled ancillary and ad hoc hypotheses about prefer- ences into realist, institutionalist, and constructivist theories to make them at various aspects of the Asian cases, including: assumptions about an irrational North Korean leadership, predictions of an expansionist and revisionist China, and depictions of Japanese foreign policy as “abnormal.”18 Social science moves forward from the clear statement of a theory, its causal logic, and its predictions. Just as important, however, is the rigorous assessment of the the- ory, especially if predictions oowing from it fail to materialize. **__Exploring why scholars have misunderstood Asia is both a fruitful and a necessary theoretical exercise.__** Two major problems exist with many of the pessimistic predictions about Asia. First, __when confronted with the nonbalancing of Asian states against China, the lack of Japanese rearmament, and ave decades of noninvasion by North Korea, scholars typically respond: Just wait.__ __This reply__, however, is intellectually ambiguous. Although it would be unfair to expect instantaneous na- tional responses to changing international conditions, __a dozen years would seem to be long enough to detect at least some change.__ Indeed Asian nations have historically shown an ability to respond quickly to changing circum- stances. The Meiji restoration in Japan in 1868 was a remarkable example of governmental response to European and American encroachment, and by 1874 Japan had emerged from centuries of isolation to occupy Taiwan.19 More recently, with the introduction of market reforms in late 1978, when Deng Xiaoping famously declared, “To get rich is glorious,” the Chinese have trans- formed themselves from diehard socialists to exuberant capitalists beginning less than three years after Mao’s death in 1976.20 __In the absence of a specific time frame, the “just wait” response is un-falsifiable__. Providing a causal logic that explains how and when scholars can expect changes is an important as- pect of this response, and reasonable scholars will accept that change may not be immediate but may occur over time. __Without such a time frame__, however, __the “just wait” response is mere rhetorical wordplay designed to avoid troubling evidence.__</span>

"It won't be easy, but with enough tactical errors on the ground, shortsighted political strategies, and continued ignorance of our vast cultural differences, we could have a horrific, full-fledged quagmire by 2012." __Added Obama, "Together, we can make Afghanistan into a nightmarish hell-scape Americans will regret for generations to come."__ __The U.S. plan to build a lasting quagmire in Afghanistan calls for the loss of at least 5,000 coalition troops, nearly 1,500 of whom have already been killed, and a wasted investment of nearly $1 trillion, a quarter of which has thus far been spent.__ With more than 80 percent of the country currently under Taliban control, Defense Secretary Robert __Gates argued that U.S. nation-dismantling efforts are actually proceeding ahead of schedule.__ __"We've made a complete mess of local institutions, and moving forward this substantial lack of infrastructure will be the cornerstone of our strategy to ensure long-term chaos in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region,__" said Gates, gesturing to a complex, 6-foot-tall wall map of what were either newly established al-Qaeda bases in Waziristan, tribal trade routes over the Hindu Kush, or perhaps U.S. military outposts of some kind. "__I couldn't be happier with our progress. This place is a complete clusterfuck."__ __A number of Pentagon officials said they were proudly holding on to their false glimmer of hope for a victory that remains forever out of reach, and explained that waging a war that can only end in sorrow has validated all their efforts__. The U.S. effort in Afghanistan hasn't always looked so bleak. In 2004, when Afghanistan ratified a new constitution and directly elected a leader for the first time in its history, a number of government officials feared the quagmire would fail and perhaps even lead to relative peace and security. But American military and diplomatic initiatives to prop up the corrupt regime of Hamid Karzai paved the way for this year's utterly fraudulent presidential election, an event which gave the quagmire-building effort a much needed shot in the arm. "__Some say the war in Afghanistan is already a quagmire, being as it's gone on for eight years and the situation on the ground continues to rapidly deteriorate,"__ said Gen. Stanley McChrystal. "__But I know we can do better. There are still dozens of tribal allies to alienate, troop morale could sink even lower, to the point of mutiny, and by continuing to fire a bunch of missiles from unmanned predator drones we have the opportunity to scare the living shit out of every last civilian in the region.__" Continued McChrystal, "__If we play our cards right, the word 'Afghanistan' could soon replace the word 'Iraq' as the agreed-upon successor to the word 'Vietnam' in the American political lexicon."__ The loose network of warlords who rule the Afghan countryside were also optimistic about quagmire-building efforts. "Our nation is already impossibly fragmented, but I believe the United States has the ability to make things even worse here," said a local tribal leader, who asked to speak anonymously due to his constantly shifting alliances with the two sides. "Afghanistan has a proud, ancient tradition of quagmires: Soviet Russia, the British Empire, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan. These are big shoes to fill, but if anyone can do it, these foolish Americans can." With President Karzai's government maintaining ties to known drug traffickers, and 68,000 U.S. soldiers struggling to police a harsh, challenging landscape, __all the conditions for a multigenerational quagmire seem to be in place.__ For many analysts, the question now is: __How will Obama ensure the U.S. entanglement in the region remains permanent?__ By deploying more troops, __by withdrawing them and leaving behind an unspeakable disaster, by increasing sympathy for the Taliban in nuclear-armed Pakistan? There are so many options on the table that many feel a quagmire is virtually guaranteed.__ "We have so much to thank the Americans for," said Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, a notorious warlord who will become vice president if Karzai wins a runoff election scheduled for Nov. 7. "__Not only have they created a lawless environment that has allowed us to capture 90 percent of the opium market, but their heroin habits have made a few of us very rich."__ __"I love the Americans and I hope they stay for many years,"__ he added. "__Many, many, many, many years."__ </span>

The Cold War came to an end and so too the great profits of the MIC. Reductions in the Pentagon budget threatened the lifeblood of the industry; a new enemy had to be unearthed. There__</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;"> is no war</span>__<span style="color: black;"> – </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">hence no profit</span>__<span style="color: black;"> – </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">without evildoers, without terrorists lurching at every corner, waiting patiently for the moment to strike, instilling fear into our lives, absorbing our attention. We are told our nation is in imminent danger</span>__<span style="color: black;">, that we are a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. And so we fear, transforming our mass uneasiness into nationalistic and patriotic fervor, wrapping ourselves up in the flag and the Military Industrial Complex. We have fallen into the mouse trap, becoming the subservient slaves of an engine run by greed, interested not in peace but constant war, constant killing and constant sacrifice to the almighty dollar. Brainwashed to believe that War is Peace we sound the drums of war, marching our sons and daughters to a battle that cannot be won either by sword or gun. </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">We are programmed to see the world as a conflict between "Us" versus "Them", "Good" versus "Evil," that we must inflict death on those who are not with us and on those against us.</span>__<span style="color: black;"> The MIC prays on our human emotions and psychology, exploiting human nature and our still fragile memories of the horrors of 9/11, manipulating us to believe that what they say and do is right for us all. __We unite behind one common enemy__</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">, fearing for our lives, complacent and obedient, blindly descending like a plague of locusts onto foreign land, devastating, usurping, </span>____<span style="color: black;">conquering and devouring those who have been deemed enemies of the state</span>____<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">, those who harbor and live among them, "evil ones," "evildoers" and "haters of </span>____<span style="color: black;">freedom," all for the sake of</span>__ __<span style="color: black;">profit and pillage, ideology and empire</span>____<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">.</span>__<span style="color: black;"> Power unfettered and unleashed, our freedoms die and are released __The so-called "War on Terror" is but a charade, a fear-engendering escapade, designed to last into perpetuity__, helping guarantee that the Military Industrial Complex will grow exponentially in power. It is a replacement for a Cold War long ago since retired and unable to deliver a massive increase in defense spending. Terrorists and the countries that harbor them have replaced the Soviet Union and Communists as enemy number one. </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">With a war that may go on indefinitely, </span>____<span style="color: black;">pursuing an enemy that lives in shadows and in the haze of ambiguity, the MIC will grow ever more powerful</span>____<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">, conscripting hundreds of thousands of our youth, sending them to guide, operate and unleash their products of death.</span>__<span style="color: black;"> Rumblings of bringing back the draft are growing louder, and if you think your children and grandchildren will escape it, think again. In a war without end, in battles that do not cease, the MIC will need human flesh from which to recycle those who perish and fall wounded. Empire building needs bodies and drones to go with military might, instruments of death need trigger fingers and human brains, and, with so many expendable young men and women being conditioned in this so-called "war on terror," MIC will continue its reprogramming of citizen soldiers from peaceful civilians to warmongering killing machines. After all, "War is Peace." Yet the Department of War, ever steadfast to use its weaponry, fails to realize that no amount of money will win this war if the root causes of terrorism are not confronted as priority number one. If you get to the roots, you pull out the weed. If not, it grows back again and again. But perhaps </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">a </span>____<span style="color: black;">perpetual war is what MIC has sought all along</span>____<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">. A lifetime of combat, a lifetime of profit, a lifetime of power.</span>__<span style="color: black;"> Assembly lines of missiles, bombs, tanks and aircraft operate without pause, helping expand a sluggish economy and the interests of the Pax Americana. __Profit over people, violence before peace, the American killing machine continues on its path to human extinction__, and it is the hands and minds of our best and brightest building and creating these products of decimation. </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">While we look over our shoulders for terrorists and evildoers, the world ominously looks directly at us with both eyes intently focused on the armies of the "Great Satan" and the "Evil Empire,"</span>__<span style="color: black;"> not knowing which nation will be attacked or on whom the storm of satellite-guided-missiles will rain down on next</span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. </span>____<span style="color: black;">In becoming pre-emptive warmongers,</span>__ __<span style="color: black;">we are</span>____<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;"> also becoming victims of our own making, </span>____<span style="color: black;">helping assure a swelling wrath of revenge, resentment and retaliation against us</span>____<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">. If we kill we will be killed, if we destroy we will be destroyed.</span>__<span style="color: black;"> The MIC is leading us down a steep canyon of fury, making us a pariah, a rogue country in the eyes of the world. </span>__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">We are becoming that which we fear most, a terrorist state.</span>__<span style="color: black;"> As political scientist and ex-marine C. Douglas Lummis has said, "Air bombardment is state terrorism, the terrorism of the rich. It has burned up and blasted apart more innocents in the past six decades than have all the anti-state terrorists who have ever lived. Something has benumbed our consciousness against this reality." __Today we are seen__, along with Israel, __as the greatest threats to world peace.__ When hundreds of thousands throughout the planet call Bush "the world’s number one terrorist," that less than admirable distinction is automatically imputed onto the nation as a whole and the citizens in particular. This can be seen in the world’s perception and treatment of us today.</span>

__<span style="color: black;">The militarization of knowledge is found in its pure form in the university</span>__<span style="color: black;">. __Militarized knowledge is a way of knowing the world and relationships between humans, characterized by an acceptance and promotion of violence and war.__ In militarized society __we come to know the world and our fellow humans in terms of the hostile other__. __Other nations become enemies. Other peoples become dehumanized__. __The world becomes possess-able if we are strong enough__, disposable if we so choose. Militarized knowl- edge adopts a worldview of force not understanding, violence not peace. __Militarized society relies on knowledge to create technological solutions to our problems and con- flicts.__ This is always __at the expense of__ humanistic knowledge – the __ways of knowing and relating to the world which find solutions in peace and organization, not violence and quantity.__ Because universities are at the center of knowledge creation in our society, __we find our institutions of higher learning imbued with violence__. The __militarization of univer- sities leads to a spiraling effect further strengthening the forces of war__. __Militarized universities produce__: mil- itary technologies including – __new weapons,__ warfare systems, __ways of thought and organization distinct to the goals of coercion and force, and the per- manent technological revolution of warfare itself.__ Universities in service of the warfare state __also produce the human resources demanded by the militarized society__. Universities churn out the politi- cians, technocrats, bureaucrats, and skilled work- ers demanded by the society which so dili- gently produces and executes the means of destruction. These graduates, having learned about the world, its society, and applied sciences through the lens of warfare go forth and __recreate this calamity.__ The __future politicians will lead the nation into future wars, and the future engineers will construct future combat systems, while we all obey and simply "do our jobs__." __The system further entrenches itself, war begets war,__ the __institutions of knowledge produce destruction at the expense of creation.__ The __technologies meant to banish war as unimaginabley destructive, and obsolete have only accomplished the former__.

<span style="color: black;">Giroux suggests that __those working in the “hypermodern militarized knowledge factories”__ (p. 74) __should ask a number of critical and “uncomfortable” questions:__ “__What role do intellectuals play in the conditions that allow theory and knowledge to be appropriated__ […in ways __that]__ produce lethal weapons, __fuel an arms race…and corrupt ethical standards__…and __what can they do politically to prevent__ […__their work] from being militarized__…?” And crucially, how do opposition and resistance to militarization in the academy “connect to [public intellectual] work and extend [students’ and teachers’] sense of social and political responsibility to the world outside of the academy?” __One vital task for intellectuals is to employ critical pedagogical practices that promote ethical citizenship, encourage a__ willingness to take risks and responsibilities for a __more substantive democracy__, __and “connect knowledge and power in the interests of social responsibility and justice__.” (pp. 57-58) Giroux’s The University in Chains, is an intellectually rigorous and politically challenging contribution to our understanding of US culture, US politics and US education in our increasingly (and dangerously) militarized society and world, and a careful examination of the ways in which the capitalist market, the Pentagon-system, and right-wing fundamentalism corrupt and condition the academy and culture. The University in Chains is a stunning tour-de-force that meticulously examines how the multi-tiered and interpenetrating __military__, corporate, and right-wing __assaults on the university undermine higher education as a potentially and necessary democratic public sphere in which students__ and teachers could, and __should, develop a sense of individual and social agency__ in the context of experiencing meaningful democratic social relations __while identifying, critiquing, and working to overcome authoritarian forms of power and authority.__</span>

Activism and Ironic Identities” The Electronic Journal of Communications Volume 18 Numbers 2, 3, & 4, 2008 </span>__<span style="color: blue;">http://www.cios.org/www/ejc/EJCPUBLIC/018/2/01846.html</span>__<span style="color: black;">)</span>
<span style="color: black;">Finally, another piece of the puzzle about __why activists would choose to speak ironically has to do with their positioning vis-à-vis the mass media and their potential audience__. These __groups are attempting to capture attention that has not already been granted them, often the attention of both passersby and of the news media.__ Thus, for all of the groups, __entertainment value is key to the success of their actions,__ as, at the very least, it assures they will be noticed. For this reason__, the potential pleasure that particular stunts may afford their viewers is a key concern in their design, a pleasure often conceptualized in opposition to the potential displeasure of the straightforwardly didactic.__ Of course, the ironic forms of play surveyed here are not, by any stretch of the imagination, the only type of activism operating today, nor are they the only type necessary to effect social change. However, they have taken on a much more significant and privileged role within activism in recent years. This shift is certainly linked to a more general upsurge of focus on culture within activist communities, meaning that it is no longer an area considered peripheral to the work of organizing, letter writing, or marching. Addressing this larger phenomenon, Stephen Duncombe explains that __culture, both as entertainment and information, is one of the leading sectors of the economy, so that “the idea of a performed cultural world seems second nature to us. Add into this mix the Internet, the virtual world of signs and symbols where an increasing amount of our everyday life takes place, and it’s no surprise that activism has embraced culture. Activists have become cultural guerrillas__ __because this is the terrain of the battles they fight”__ (Cultural 333). Today’s __activists are often savvy cultural producers as well as consumers__. And it is within this larger context that __irony has come to the fore as a type of counter-cultural dominant.__ Drawing strategically from past performative activist groups such as The Situationists, The Yippies, and ACT UP, the contemporary groups emphasize Do-It-Yourself (DIY) activism and “viral” protest models that are creative and accessible. __The ironic hook can be easily picked up and replicated, used to stoke allegiances and, ideally, to shift the direction of wider public debate.__ </span>

**Piradical Politics 1ac**
**We are at a crossroads in history. On one hand, we have an opportunity to fundamentally shake our understandings of politics, international relations, and our understanding of the other, those outside of Western narratives about humanity. Our occupation of the Middle East is not the first time we have come to this point; we were in the same place during Vietnam. When we left Vietnam, activists wasted the opportunity, allowing politicians to rewrite history and manipulate our understanding of Vietnam such that it was in our political interest, further consolidating Western-centric domination.**
**The same thing is happening in Iraq: we all should have known that this invasion would fail miserably, but we did it anyways.**

The strategy the US ... course, sacrificed far more.

**With the collapse of the façade of the power of the West in Iraq, we have this unique opportunity again, but state forces, in and outside of debate, continue to re-appropriate the opportunity, demanding instead that it is in our military-hegemonic interest to withdraw, as an act to preserve power. If this is the understanding we have of the West’s wars, we’re doomed to repeat ourselves. If we understand that, really, we’re getting our asses kicked and no one wants us in Iraq other than our own egos, then we can actually break the stranglehold of Orientalism.**

**The problem is that we’ve been looking at this topic and this conflict from a reactive position. Asking “how can we get out of Iraq so as to save face for the West is synonymous?” with “how can we defend the resolution so as to get our hegemony advantages?” These epistemological constraints we’ve placed on ourselves will fail to rid us of imperialism and, more importantly, are preventing us from formulating active principles of resistance against imperialism.**
**Well, no longer – we are an active call for civil resistance, we are taking this space and smoothing it out, making it a place of freedom and a safehaven for a discussion of how to truly live. We understand this act through a metaphor of piracy – fleeing from oppressive statist forces in order to live freely, and to enjoy life. We are here to negotiate our own principles and establish our own codes in order to both engage with the topic and address the root problem with presence in Iraq and THROUGHOUT the world. We must engage AS pirates to defeat the structures generating Western narratives about the rest of the world.**

**This debate round is practice for war-planning and the role of the ballot should be to arbitrate between methodologies for creating military doctrine. The counterplan creates a framework for changing doctrine that is responsive to changing battlefield conditions, historical experience and the development of new technological innovations. THE COUNTERPLAN IMMEDIATELY RESULTS IN THE PLAN, if the 1AC is correct that the plan is the proper response to current geopolitical conditions HOWEVER it allows for the possibility of minor modification and future rollback in response to unknown long-term developments in which the rigorous criteria of adaptive doctrinal shift are met, including empirical evidence and verification, field testing of weapons systems in simulations and training exercises and intellectual testing by academic at military service academies. Our net-benefit is dogmatism- trading one inadaptive doctrine for another means that the structural problems of mission creep, overlap and resource allocation are inevitable with the development of new technology and focus on new areas of the world making all of their scenarios inevitable. ONLY the counterplan facilitates effective force structure that allows us to learn from our mistakes which means that effective implementation is a DA to the plan and a net-benefit to the counterplan. Inflexible and untested doctrine guarantees disaster and loss of life**

**Our counterplan begs the question of 1AC solvency—by establishing an enduring and permanent doctrinal change in response to ephemeral circumstances the plan’s status as a good idea is highly contingent. The question of the debate is not ‘will there ever be a need for nuclear missions for X weapons system’ but rather ‘is it a good policy-making METHOD’ to formulate doctrine around the presumption that doctrine should NOT be adaptive to changing circumstances. They do not have a defense of inadaptive doctrinal changes which means they can’t win offense against the counterplan**

==afghanistan counterplan== 

**CP Text: The United States federal government should delegate to local tribal councils, such as Jirga and Shura, the authority to draft and enact budgets, to use traditional alternatives to centralized justice systems for some offenses, to elect or approve important officials who are now appointed by Kabul, and to collect local revenue and enforce local regulation. The central government in Kabul should maintain authority over both foreign policy and internal security matters; however, execution of rural security matters should be placed under local control. The United States federal government should maintain current troop levels in Afghanistan until the transition is complete and a stable government is established.**

**Decentralization would preserve local autonomy and grant the government legitimacy. It would also remove the motive for insurgency solve all their stability advantages. Finally, it makes government counter-terror activities more successful.**

Power sharing would be easier under a decentralized democracy... reasonable chance of balancing interests and adjudicating disputes in Afghanistan, too.

**Success in Afghanistan means creating a decentralized government that would be acceptable to security interests. This requires a clear statement of the objective and concerted effort to produce that objective. Saying Afghanistan is ungovernable is a flawed assumption and is based solely on the pursuit of a centralized, Western style government.**

There is an urgent need to refine the international community's state-building and counterinsurgency efforts in response to the Taliban's bottom-up strategy.

One key area is security. During Afghanistan's most recent stable period... fundamental to daily life, community pressure can be a powerful weapon.

**Decentralization can overcome problems such as the Taliban and government legitimacy by gaining the support of the population and enabling local leaders to check corruption; however, it will need a sustained US counterinsurgency mission for these efforts to be successful.**

**Policy debate rounds function around wholly contrived mechanisms for decision-calculus that have more to do with abstract theoretical principles of behavior and prediction than they do with how the world actually works. We ask you for this debate to assume the position of a radical empiricist, to strip away the nonsense and encounter the world as if you are discovering everything for the first time, like a scientist on an alien planet**

**Gilles Deleuze provides a possible model for doing this in ‘87**

Why write, why have ... take the place of concepts.

**As an empiricist, you find the affirmative’s scenarios somewhat far-fetched. It is not that they are impossible, but given what you know about the world they do not seem plausible. In fact, it is the very specificity of their scenarios makes them mathematically improbably, and the emphasis in debate on specificity is a heuristic device that is the exact opposite of how risk should be assigned**

This debate you slip out into the night and hide in the corners yourself, you explore the darkness with all your senses and find a world that is filled with strange creatures, pain and pleasure, but where catastrophes are rare and unpredictable.**

**Do not subordinate the universe of raw materials to your desire to only see smiling faces and pleasant outcomes. To truly act as the empiricist, you must dispassionately encounter the pain as well as the pleasure in the world, the bad as well as the good. This encounter represents the only possibility of creating an ethical connection with other people.**

From the position of the empiricist, you should not be concerned with the future or the past as these are only historical constructions which are themselves hostages of larger ideological systems. As an empiricist, your business is the present, the flows of matter an energy, the beauty of self-organized material into cycles of creation and destruction that inspire one another. Lose yourself in these fluxes of material and let them strip away what you thought you knew about reality and about policy debate. Don’t make interpretations, predictions or good guesses as if the future can be measured or estimated—your best guess is less accurate than trying to figure out how many jelly beans fill a jar that know one has ever seen. Instead you should experiment, rigorously define your terms and their relations and let your approach be fluid. Realize that this debate round has always been a fluid experiment of which you are already a component part, throw your pre-conceptions to the wind and become an empiricist.**

==difference kritik== 

===1nc=== 
**Throughout this debate, you should evaluate both team’s speech acts through the important lens of the axiom that POWER IS FLUID. Power is always changing, reconstituted in accordance with specific social situations and according to cultural conditions. Each time we interact, new and different power relations are reconstituted.**

**In this light, their 1ac is a double turn: they have proven that whiteness, like power, is fluid and always changing and reconstituting itself in new strategies to continue its supremacy. The 1ac goes on to isolate fixed and specific instances of whiteness—this practice locks us into political stasis through stable identities, which ultimately debilitate difference.**
**Harman 2k9.** Graham Harman, professor of philosophy American University of Cairo, “Prince of Networks: Bruno Latour and Metaphysics” pg. 22

Even power, that favourite ... but so are the powerful.

**Positioning personal experience as a justification for action creates a insulation from reevaluation--“You can’t criticize how I felt!” This process prevents criticism of the status quo, which can be rendered as purely subjective—“That’s only your experience, it can’t be applied to larger structural problems of social organization.” Vote negative to affirm criticism of ANY identity categories.**
**Scott 97.** Joan Scott, Professor of History at Princeton, 1997, Feminists Theorize the Political, “Experience”

When the evidence offered ... including the category of “experience.”

**They present difference through the lens of stable identity tropes, which are the product of majoritarian thought. Rather than fluid, they see identity as terretorialized in cultural practices and norms, dooming their project as they are subsumed within the hegemonic logic of representing the other in a dominant manner. Voting neg allows difference to speak rather than be spoken for.**
**Tormey 2k6.** Simon Tormey, Politics at University of Nottingham, 2006, Parliamentary Affairs 2006 59(1):138-154

The issue for Deleuze is how ... affirmation of singularity.

**They are caught up in an economy of representations which STILL posits whiteness as a universal against which all ways of being are measured, which turns the case. The alternative dissolves the notion of the majority against which minorities are measured.**
**Tormey 2k6.** Simon Tormey, Politics at University of Nottingham, 2006, Parliamentary Affairs 2006 59(1):138-154

It is from this perspective ... different, singular, ‘univocal’.

**Reject the affirmative for their representational strategy. Rather than challenging specific representations of identity we challenge the identity of representation itself. Our strategy solves oppression and can be politically effective—the Zapatistas provide a model**
**Tormey 2k6.** Simon Tormey, Politics at University of Nottingham, 2006, Parliamentary Affairs 2006 59(1):138-154

In order to advance the case ... suggestive and at worst opaque.5


===2nc turns the case=== 

**Their presumption of whiteness as always already implicated in oppression allows the operation of power to easily side-step opposition. Once resistance has become static, the system of racial oppression can put on another mask. The reason Michael Steele uses street talk in order to make the neoliberal violence of the Republican Party agenda seem more minority-friendly, or why that Bush continually emphasized Saddam's violence against Kurdish minority groups as a justification for the invasion of Iraq is because they recognize that the 1ac’s model of racial politics is fickle and easily to manipulate.**
**Rather, resistance must remain fluid and nomadic. We are never one person but always many at once tending towards a plethora of possible futures. We are not of a tribe but rather are members of many multitudes. Not one fixed location of whiteness, but many.**
**Tormey 2k8.** Simon Tormey, Politics at University of Nottingham, 2006, Parliamentary Affairs 2006 59(1):138-154

As we noted above, the representative ... the stance of the ‘post-representative’.


===at: alternative doesn't solve=== 


**The alternative is practical – the Zapatista model is an appropriate one for post-representational politics that probably solves the kritik and the case.**

===at: method first===

One of the central ... here, as I will illustrate.

**Interest convergence accounts for the material context of the 1960’s civil rights gains – Only our framework consistently explains the ups AND downs of minority empowerment by identifying the implicit bargain between concessions from government elites and the ideological support of black communities.**

Mary Dudziak's Cold ... the establishment's bidding.

**B. Let’s Make A Deal:**

**Our political economy examines the ballot as a moment of interest convergence – First between the 1AC and the structures of white supremacy and Second between the AFF team and the judge.**

**FIRST, the 1AC makes the same bargain as the postwar Civil Right Compromise:**

**For the structures of white supremacy, racial equity is not an end in and of itself – The price extracted in exchange for the legitimacy of the plan is accepting the current terms of American nationalism which means that the official antiracism they advocate must remain blind to the linkage between race and the imperialism of American capital.**

**SECOND, The Maoist**

**The ballot is also a moment of interest convergence between the Affirmative and the judge – This rhetorical alliance with alterity is a technology of political demand that repeats the strategic attitude of the system it seeks to overturn – The guilty solidarity of the 1AC masks the privilege that prevents the AFF project from directly changing the lives of the people they invoke to warrant a ballot.**

**Chow – Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities @ Brown - 1993**
(Rey, Writing Diaspora: Tactics of Intervention in Contemporary Cultural Studies, p. 16-17) jfs

Why are "tactics" useful ... in the academic sense?

**AND, Within the Affirmative project, the ballot functions as a politics of self-subalternization, where the judges are encouraged to found a vacuous solidarity with the Affirmative Other by valorizing the material deprivation portrayed in the 1AC – However, their rhetorical strategy amounts to nothing more than a sham renunciation authorized by the same structures of power that produce alterity in the first place, turning the case at a higher level of analysis.**

(Rey, Writing Diaspora: Tactics of Intervention in Contemporary Cultural Studies, p. 10-11) jfs

The Orientalist has a special ... that enables her rhetoric.

**C. Interest Divergence:**

**The interest convergence represented by the ballot is temporary at best – Empirically, the implicit bargain that grants empowerment in exchange for minority support of elite policy demands cannot last – The most resistant elements of movements will either be bought off or brutally suppressed, turning the case either way.**

**Delgado – Law Professor @ University of Colorado-Boulder – 2002**
(Richard, “Explaining the Rise and Fall of African American Fortunes: Interest Convergence and Civil Rights Gains,” Review of Mary L.

The Black Panther Party ... while in their beds. n121



**The AFF’s chunky identity politics of the ballot collapse the real material differences between the positioning of the judge and the AFF team – Their deployment of an undifferentiated posture of victimization is a technique for spotlighting the judge’s righteousness at the cost of robbing the terms of protest of the complex oppositionality critical to rightful demands.**

In the "cultural studies" ... had our consciousnesses “raised.”


===at: social location=== 

**The attempt to make structural suffering accessible with scenes of particular people individuates systemic harms in order to make them manageable – The 1AC packaging facilitates analytic paralysis by narrowing the means for legitimate calls to action, deferring structural transformations in exchange for handing off the burden of articulating oppression to those who most directly experience it.**
