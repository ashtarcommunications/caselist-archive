**Existentialism AC(the formatting is really messed up but i think its readable)**

Lipsey defines rehabilitation:
Lipsey, Mark W. and Cullen, Francis T. (2007). //The Effectiveness of Correctional Rehabilitation: A Review of Systematic Reviews.// Annual Review of Law and Social Science (3).
__**Rehabilitation**__ treatment __**is**__.... __**exhibited by many offenders.**__

v: **morality**


Ontological questionings of being are a fundamental part of morality.
Webster:
(Scott Webster. Existentialism: Providing an ideal framework for educational research in times of uncertainty. Faculty of Education. Monash University.)

__**Existential writers**__... __**encourage to other entities.**__


Ontological questioning is a prerequisite to true moral codes.
Webster 2:(ibid)

While __**one is never completely able... one exists can be developed.**__

**All thought based on experience.**
**Hume:**

<span style="color: #222222;">But although our </span>**__thought__** <span style="color: #222222;">seems to ... never been introduced to us in the only way in which an idea can get into the mind, namely through actual feeling and sensation.</span>



**Existence precedes essence**
**Sartre:**

If one considers an article of manufacture as, for example, a b/.. Sartre’s answer to all moral dilemmas is the same, **“__You are free, therefore choose, that is to say, invent.__**



I contend that affirming protects people’s ability to confront their existential existence.

a). Some analytic reasons.

b).

Rehab takes a heads on approach to changing and revitalizing people’s lives to ensure they think about why they exist and approach their lives. This is confirmed in a study that took an in depth look at different people in a rehabilitative center.

**__The findings clearly indicate__...****<span style="line-height: 1.5;">__aspects of the old life and self.__</span>**



By allowing the patients to realize that they had made a mistake and confront who they are, it allowed a new approach to the rehabilitative process. Halldorsdottir 2

Only a contractualist system can take into account justification of principles to others

I contend retribution and contractualism go hand in hand.
