<span style="font-size: 8pt;">THE C ONTINGENCY </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">A new</span> and potentially <span style="background-color: yellow;">dangerous crisis could erupt in Korea over the next twelve</span> to eighteen <span style="background-color: yellow;">months</span> for at least three reasons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>First, <span style="background-color: yellow;">although tensions have subsided </span>in the wake of the Cheonan incident, an atmosphere of recrimination and <span style="background-color: yellow;">mistrust remains</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>U.S. and Republic of Korea (ROK) <span style="background-color: yellow;">forces are on high alert</span> to respond to potential future provocations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Until a prolonged period of calm returns, the risk of another deadly clash between North Korea and South Korea remains real. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Further naval incidents</span> along the disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the Yellow Sea <span style="background-color: yellow;">are</span> certainly conceivable and arguably more <span style="background-color: yellow;">likely</span> now that South Korea has modified its rules of engagemen</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">t to permit more rapid response to North Korean incursions. Stepped-up intelligence gathering operations along the periphery of North Korea might also be viewed as intolerably intrusive and elicit a military response, as has happened in the past. Similarly, the interdiction of suspected illicit North Korean goods and materials under the UN sanctions regime might spark another military clash. </span><u>Second, <span style="background-color: yellow;">North Korea may engage in</span> a renewed campaign of <span style="background-color: yellow;">provocative behavior for domestic reasons</span>. The sharp contraction of economic assistance from South Korea and other <span style="background-color: yellow;">sanctions</span> imposed by the international community <span style="background-color: yellow;">have caused considerable pain</span> to North Korea, pushing it into a deeper—and arguably unhealthy—dependence on Chinese support</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As it did with previous nuclear and missile testing, the North may see carefully calibrated provocations against South Ko2 rea, Japan, and by extension the United States, as its only recourse to lessen the diplomatic and economic pressure that has been brought to bear on it. Renewed missile testing and further improvements by North Korea to its nuclear weapons capability—such as increased production of fissile material, weaponization of devices, and operational deployments––would be the more obvious ways for it to intimidate the principal players into making concessions. </span><u>Alternatively, various kinds of <span style="background-color: yellow;">“external action” may be carried out to support the leadership succession</span> process that is underway in Pyongyang</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Kim Jong-Il’s third son—Kim Jong-Un—has emerged as the heir apparent, judging by his “coming out” at the Korean Workers Party conference in September 2010. He is young and inexperienced, however, and </span><u>many observers believe that his <span style="background-color: yellow;">leadership credentials will need to be burnished to strengthen his legitimacy</span> as future ruler of North Korea, <span style="background-color: yellow;">especially among the</span> senior ranks of the <span style="background-color: yellow;">military</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on whom he will rely for support. Some have speculated that the sinking of the Cheonan was authorized for this very purpose; there have even been reports that Kim Jong-Un personally ordered the attack. Just as his father planned and authorized a series of major provocations in the 1970s while waiting in the wings to assume full power, Kim Jong-Un may do the same. Such incidents might include, for example, more covert submarine attacks; the seizure of an uninhabited but contested island in the Yellow Sea; special forces infiltrations designed to embarrass the Lee Myung-bak administration at critical moments and rattle investor confidence in South Korea; and interference with the operation of the joint Kaesong industrial park. </span><u>Third, the succession process may not proceed as planned. Kim Jong-Il could pass from the scene before the designated leadership arrangements have been consolidated.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In such circumstances it is not hard to imagine how the new leadership—whether it is Kim Jong-Un in sole charge or as part of a regency arrangement––could be challenged by others in the regime, either out of personal ambition or because of policy differences. Such disagreements might be triggered or exacerbated by other factors, such as an acutely deteriorating economic situation that precipitates an internal competition for scarce economic resources, or a major humanitarian crisis that provokes internal criticism of the new leader’s stewardship. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Political instability</span> of this kind <span style="background-color: yellow;">could manifest itself in</span> several unwelcome ways for North Korea’s neighbors. For example, the leadership could stage <span style="background-color: yellow;">military provocations to fan an external threat and distract the elites</span> in Pyongyang while also <span style="background-color: yellow;">providing the pretext to purge elements threatening</span> to <span style="background-color: yellow;">the regime</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Kim Il-Sung, the founding father of North Korea, did just that by exploiting a campaign of external provocation in the late 1960s to consolidate his leadership at a particularly contentious time. An internal power struggle could also lead to external appeals for assistance by particular factions, border incidents involving high-level defections, rogue military operations designed to foment a counterresponse against the regime, mass killings, and ultimately widespread civil strife. Depending on either the amount of spillover or level of life-threatening internal unrest, South Korea, the United States, and China would all come under considerable pressure from various domestic constituencies as well as international organizations to intervene and restore order. Should the North Korean regime begin to lose control over the rest of the country, this imperative would likely prove irresistible especially for South Korean leaders, who would likely see it as a historic but possibly fleeting opportunity to reunify the peninsula. The risk of serious military escalation varies for each of these three scenarios, with the first having the lowest and the third the highest. </span><u>Although everyone concerned wants to prevent a major outbreak of hostilities—South Korea fears losing its hard-won prosperity and a much weaker North knows that another war would almost certainly result in its demise—<span style="background-color: yellow;">the potential for miscalculation, misunderstanding, and unintended escalation cannot be dismissed</span>. Indeed, <span style="background-color: yellow;">a combination of factors could propel a crisis beyond what the </span>principal <span style="background-color: yellow;">protagonists </span>might initially <span style="background-color: yellow;">expect </span>or desire.</u><br />

<u><span style="background-color: yellow;">With North Korea shelling a South Korean island</span>, and Seoul responding in kind, <span style="background-color: yellow;">fears of a second Korean War are wafting</span> through Washington</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Thankfully, </span><u>even Pyongyang doesn’t want to revive that conflict, but <span style="background-color: yellow;">the possibility of mistake and accident remain</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Naturally, the United States reiterated its usual security guarantees. The White House said America was “firmly committed” to the South’s defense. But </span><u>why is Washington mixed up in potential hostilities on the Korean Peninsula</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? The U.S. commitment grew out of World War II. Washington divided occupation duties on the peninsula, a colony of defeated Japan, with the Soviet Union. Two separate countries emerged, followed by a three-year conflict, in which America intervened. In 1953 the warring sides agreed to an armistice. The United States gave South Korea a defense treaty and military garrison to keep the peace. Since then the world has changed. The Republic of Korea has rushed past its northern antagonist economically. With the thirteenth-largest economy in the world, the ROK now has about forty times the GDP of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. South Korea also has twice the DPRK’s population, as well as a vast technological edge. Moreover, Seoul has detached North Korea’s traditional allies. The Soviet Union went AWOL under Mikhail Gorbachev. Although Vladimir Putin’s Moscow has somewhat repaired its relationship with Pyongyang, Russia still has a far more important economic relationship with the ROK. So does China, which trades fifty times as much with the South as with the North. Only in military strength does the DPRK retain a numerical edge over Seoul. North Korea has 1.1 million men under arms, an impressive number, but individual conscripts tend to be malnourished and of uncertain quality. Their weapons are antiquated. A prime fighting force the North Korean military is not. The South only has about seven hundred thousand men under arms, but they are better trained and deploy better weapons. In any case, Seoul has the resources to provide whatever it believes necessary for its own defense. There is no special gravitational field on the peninsula that keeps the ROK military numerically inferior. South Korea simply prefers to spend its money on economic development. It was one thing for the United States to subsidize the South’s defense when that nation was vulnerable to an attack by the DPRK backed by China and the Soviet Union. That’s no longer the case. </span><u>America’s military commitment also didn’t seem to matter much when no one imagined another war was really possible.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> When the North’s “Dear Leader” Kim Jong Il was holding summits with South Korea’s presidents, conflict seemed far away. </span><u>But last March the DPRK apparently sank a South Korean warship.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Seoul did little, other than demand an apology—a demand which the government of President Lee Myung-bak recently retracted. </span><u>Now the North has staged another violent incident. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Even though Pyongyang</span> almost certainly <span style="background-color: yellow;">does not want war, its provocative behavior risks triggering one, </span>a conflict in which <span style="background-color: yellow;">the U.S. would immediately become involved</span>. In fact, there have been proposals for retaliation against the North backed by Washington. Such a step could start a war directly<span style="background-color: yellow;">. There’s no justification for keeping the United States in</span> between the two Koreas. It is long past time for Seoul to develop whatever size military it believes to be necessary</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and whatever policy towards the North it believes to be appropriate—and to accept the consequences accordingly. The ROK is strong enough to do what important countries traditionally have done throughout history, defend itself. Washington’s one area of genuine interest, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">nonproliferation, is not advanced by</span> a <span style="background-color: yellow;">troop presence</span> in the South. In fact, those are the only Americans within the North’s reach. <span style="background-color: yellow;">They are</span>, in effect, <span style="background-color: yellow;">nuclear hostages</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if Pyongyang develops nuclear weapons and delivery systems. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The latest</span> intra-Korean <span style="background-color: yellow;">skirmish should serve as that</span> proverbial <span style="background-color: yellow;">fire bell</span> in the night. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Alliances</span> can deter. They also can <span style="background-color: yellow;">entangle</span>. In the case of South Korea <span style="background-color: yellow;">the security relationship risks drawing the United States into wa</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">r</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with no countervailing benefits for Americans. After all, the ROK no longer is central to a larger international struggle, as it was during the Cold War. And </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the South is capable of deterring the DPRK and winning any conflict that might erupt</span>.</u><br />

<strong>Bandow, 2010</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute and former Special Assistant to Reagan (5/3/10, Doug, “Taming Pyongyang,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=23336" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=23336</a>, JMP) </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Suspicions continue to mount that North Korea torpedoed the Cheonan, a South Korean corvette which sank more than a month ago in the Yellow Sea to the west of the Korean peninsula. Policy makers in both Seoul and Washington are pondering how to respond. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The potential</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even if small, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">of renewed conflict on the peninsula demonstrates that today’s status quo is unsatisfactory</span> for all of the North’s neighbors.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Korean War ended in an armistice nearly six decades ago. No peace treaty was ever signed; over the years the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea committed numerous acts of war, most dramatically attempting to assassinate South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan during a visit to Burma and seizing the U.S. intelligence ship Pueblo. Conflict was avoided because the United States, long the senior partner to the Republic of Korea in their military alliance, refused to risk igniting a new conflict. </span><u>In recent years the DPRK’s conduct has remained predictably belligerent but constrained</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: fiery threats, diplomatic walk-outs, policy reversals, and unreasonable demands have mixed with occasional cooperative gestures as Washington and Seoul attempted to dissuade the North from developing nuclear weapons. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">North Korean relations <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">recently</span> have been in a down cycle</strong></span><strong>.</strong> Pyongyang has walked out of the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> long-running </span><u>Six Party talks</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and failed in its attempt to engage Washington. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ended the ROK’s “Sunshine Policy,” which essentially entailed shipping money and tourists north irrespective of the DPRK’s conduct, causing North Korea to downgrade economic and diplomatic contacts and even recently confiscate South Korean investments. Japan’s relations with the North remain stalled over the lack of accounting over the kidnapping of Japanese citizens years ago. </span><u>Still, for at least two decades Pyongyang had eschewed military action.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Shots were fired between South and North Korean ships last November near the disputed boundary in the Yellow Sea, but no harm was done. </span><u>Brinkmanship was the DPRK’s standard diplomatic strategy. Triggering a new war was not. Why the North would sink a South Korean vessel is a matter of speculation.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> More critical is the response. Now what? The issue is most pressing in Seoul. South Korean officials say the investigation continues as they seek definitive evidence that a torpedo sunk the Cheonan. The tragedy would be no less if the cause was a mine, but the latter could be dismissed as an unfortunate occurrence rather than deliberate attack. If the sinking was intentional, however, the ROK must respond. To do nothing would reward the North and encourage additional irresponsible action. President Lee Myung-bak has said: “I’m very committed to responding in a firm manner if need be.” One South Korean diplomat suggested to me that </span><u>the South will seek Security Council condemnation of the DPRK.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This is in line with President Lee’s promise “to cooperate with the international community in taking necessary measures when the results are out.” But even if Seoul won Chinese support for a UN resolution, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the ROK would have to take bilateral measures. That certainly would end investment</span> and aid, likely would <span style="background-color: yellow;">prevent negotiations and</span> <strong>possibly would <span style="background-color: yellow;">entail military retaliation</span></strong></u><strong>.</strong> <u>The result</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not only </span><u>would</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> mean a serious and prolonged worsening of bilateral relations and increase in bilateral tensions, but could </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">end any chance</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—admittedly today very slim—</span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">of reversing North Korean nuclear development.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Moreover, a military strike would entail a chance of war. </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Tit-for-tat retaliation might spiral out of control</span>.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The potential consequences are horrifying. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The ROK</span> nevertheless <span style="background-color: yellow;">might be willing to take the risk</span>. Not Washington.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The United States is cooperating in the investigation and reportedly urging the Lee government to wait for proof before acting. But even if the DPRK is culpable, the last thing the Obama administration wants is another war. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last month: “I hope that there is no talk of war, there is no action or miscalculation that could provoke a response that might lead to conflict.” From America’s standpoint, avoiding a potentially bloody war on the Korean peninsula while heavily involved in Afghanistan and still tied down in Iraq is far more important than South Korean concerns over justice and credibility. The People’s Republic of </span><u>China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><u>would be a big loser in any war: refugees would and conflict could spill over the Yalu.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The North Korean state likely would disappear, leaving a united Korea allied with America and hosting U.S. troops near China’s border. Beijing’s international reputation would suffer as its policy of aiding the North was fully and dramatically discredited. </span><u>Japan</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> would be less vulnerable to the consequences of war but </span><u>could be the target of North Korean attempts to strike out.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Undoubtedly, Tokyo also would be asked to contribute to the peninsula’s reconstruction. Of course, North Korea and its people would suffer the most. The former would cease to exist. That would be an international good, but </span><strong><u>millions of North Koreans likely would die</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or otherwise suffer along the way. War would be a tragic end to decades of hardship and isolation. What to do? Seoul needs some degree of certainty before acting. So long as the sinking might have been caused by a mine, the ROK cannot act decisively. If a torpedo attack is the most likely cause, however, winning Security Council backing would be a useful step. Then finding the right level of response, including possibly closing the Kaesong industrial park in the North or targeting a North Korean vessel for destruction, would be necessary. If it chooses the latter, the ROK would need Washington’s backing and China’s understanding. Finally, a lot of people in several countries would have to cross their fingers and say some prayers. In any case, the six-party talks would seem kaput. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said the Obama administration remained committed to the negotiations despite the sinking, stating that “I wouldn’t necessarily link those directly.” Yet </span><u>the likelihood that Pyongyang would yield its nuclear weapons while sinking South Korean vessels seems <strong>vanishingly small.</strong> Even a minimal possibility of a negotiated settlement should be pursued, but at some point <strong>the effort simply looks foolish.</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> That’s the short-term. Two longer-term issues require attention, however the current controversy is resolved. First, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the</span></u> <u><span style="background-color: yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">and ROK must reconsider their alliance relationship</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even on the issue of defending against the DPRK their interests differ: Seoul must satiate an angry public desiring vengeance as well as preserve its credibility in confronting the North. </span><strong><u>America must avoid another war at most any cost.</u></strong> <u>Given the South’s level of development, <span style="background-color: yellow;">it makes no sense</span> for its defense decisions to be subject to Washington’s veto. Nor does it make any sense <span style="background-color: yellow;">for the</span></u> <u><span style="background-color: yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">to <strong>risk being drawn into a war</strong></span> as a result of acts between other nations. These <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">bilateral differences are only likely to grow</span></strong>, especially if the relationship between America and China grows more contentious. Then South Korea could find itself risking involvement in Washington’s war.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Also involved is the ROK’s self-respect. In two years the U.S. plans on devolving operational control of the combined forces to South Korea. Yet some South Koreans fear their nation won’t be ready to lead its own defense. That Washington took military command in underdeveloped, impoverished South Korea in 1950 is understandable. To argue that America must continue doing so in 2010 is bizarre. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The international community is increasingly aware that cooperative diplomacy is the most productive way to tackle the multiple, interconnected global challenges facing humanity, not least of which is the increasing proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Korea and Northeast Asia are instances where risks of</span> nuclear proliferation and actual <span style="background-color: yellow;">nuclear use</span> arguably <span style="background-color: yellow;">have increased</span> in recent years.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This negative trend is a product of continued US nuclear threat projection against the DPRK as part of a general program of coercive diplomacy in this region, North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, the breakdown in the Chinese-hosted Six Party Talks towards the end of the Bush Administration, regional concerns over China’s increasing military power, and concerns within some quarters in regional states (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) about whether US extended deterrence (“nuclear umbrella”) afforded under bilateral security treaties can be relied upon for protection. </span><u>The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not only for the Northeast Asian region but </span><u>for the whole international community.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> At worst, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">there is the </span></u><strong><u>possibility of nuclear attack</u></strong> <span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">1</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,</span> <u>whether <span style="background-color: yellow;">by </span></u><strong><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">intention, miscalculation, or merely <span style="background-color: yellow;">accident</span></span></u></strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;"> On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust</span> of unprecedented proportions.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).</span><u>The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: That is not global winter, but </span><u>the <span style="background-color: yellow;">nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…</span><u>The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">…To make matters even worse, </span><u>such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4 These, of course, are not the only consequences. </span><u>Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The</span> direct <span style="background-color: yellow;">impacts</span>, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, <span style="background-color: yellow;">could </span></u><strong><u>make the present <span style="background-color: yellow;">global financial crisis pale by comparison</span></u></strong><u>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;"> How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">There could be</span> many <span style="background-color: yellow;">unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">5, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">with </span></u><strong><u>subsequent nuclear breakout</u></strong> <u>and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, <span style="background-color: yellow;">and</span> <strong>aftermath <span style="background-color: yellow;">chain-reaction affects</span> involving other potential proliferant states.</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community. </span><br />

<strong>Withdrawal limits the potential for US involvement and escalation stemming from North Korean provocations and causes South Korea to defuse tensions</strong><br />

<strong>Bandow, 2010</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former special assistant to Reagan (5/24/10, Doug, “Avoiding Pyongyang,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=23432" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=23432</a>, JMP) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">After an investigation of nearly two months, the Republic of Korea (ROK) has concluded that North Korea torpedoed the Cheonan, a corvette that sank in the Yellow Sea in late March. Today, Seoul is going to the United Nations Security Council. </span><u>South Korea must respond to the attack.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But no strategy is free of danger. And </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the ROK’s military alliance with America makes it more difficult for both nations to act in their respective interests</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The so-called Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has been a malign international actor since its formation six decades ago. Kim Il-sung initiated full-scale war in 1950; over the years the regime has engaged in a variety of military and terrorist attacks on both South Korean and American targets. However, since the downing of a ROK airliner in 1987, Pyongyang has been on better behavior. Brinkmanship has remained the North’s chief negotiating tactic, but the DPRK has avoided committing any blatant acts of war. Why sink a South Korean ship? It could be an unauthorized military action intended to prevent resumption of negotiations over Pyongyang’s nuclear program. It could be an attempt by Kim Jong-il to demonstrate that North Korea can strike with impunity. It could be a concession by him to the military as Kim attempts to install his young son as his successor. In any case, the attack poses a significant challenge to South Korea. But not to America. It should be obvious that </span><u>there is little the DPRK can do to harm the</u> <u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates. The North lost any significant relevance to American security with the end of the Cold War. Without a link to a potentially aggressive Soviet Union (and, to a lesser extent, a virulently revolutionary China), Pyongyang became an irrelevant backwater. Even the North’s nuclear program poses no direct threat to the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates. Nothing suggests that Kim is suicidal: he wants his virgins today, not in the afterlife. So he would never strike at America, risking retaliatory annihilation. The prospect of proliferation is worrisome, but again, Kim likely understands the enormous risks he would take selling materials to non-state actors that might target the United States. Washington is stuck in the center of Korean affairs today only because of the U.S.-ROK alliance, which provides a security guarantee to South Korea with no corresponding benefit to America. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Without</span> the alliance, there would be no <span style="background-color: yellow;">U.S. troops on the Korean peninsula</span>, within range of North Korean attack, and <span style="background-color: yellow;">no American promise to intervene in any war that might result from a provocation by Pyongyang or retaliation by the South</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The sinking of the Cheonan was an outrage, but it was an outrage against the ROK. It should not be an issue of great concern to America, which normally would offer diplomatic backing but not military support to a democratic friend. Yet </span><u>American analysts have been producing articles and studies carrying such titles as “America Must Show Resolve over North Korea”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and “U.S. Must Respond Firmly to North Korean Naval Attack.” The question is: </span><u>why? No American forces were attacked. None are likely to be targeted. The U.S. military already is very busy,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> especially in Afghanistan. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">There’s no reason for Washington to risk war over an assault on another state</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially one well able to defend itself. Were the ROK still a helpless economic wreck, one could concoct an argument for American aid. But the South vastly outranges the DPRK on every measure of national power. The ongoing debate about whether Seoul is ready to take over operational control (“OPCON”) of its own forces along with any U.S. troops during a war is symptomatic of the extreme dependency in which South Korea finds itself. For the ROK to cower fearfully before Pyongyang is roughly the equivalent of the U.S. running to Brussels to request European troops to deter a Mexican attack. At least the alliance provides an obvious benefit to Seoul: a source of military reinforcement from the global superpower. Still, </span><u>the South finds its decision-making,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even on the question of its national survival, </span><u>affected and directed by American policy makers half a world away.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Virtually every American, from think-tank analyst to Obama administration staffer, has called on South Korea to exercise “restraint.” They say the ROK’s response should be “measured.” They urge Seoul to be “cautious.” And so on. That makes sense from America’s standpoint. Indeed, the Obama administration has reason to be making much stronger representations privately. It would be folly for the United States to get into a war over the sinking of the Cheonan. It doesn’t matter that the act was criminal; it doesn’t matter that the deaths have greatly pained South Koreans; it doesn’t matter that Seoul might calculate the costs and benefits of a tough response differently. </span><u>Washington’s top priority is avoiding another war, one that likely would be costly, brutal, and bloody</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—and of no conceivable benefit to America. Obviously, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">South Koreans</span> have an even greater incentive to avoid war, since their nation would be the principal battleground. However, they <span style="background-color: yellow;">might decide that to exhibit weakness in the face of the North’s provocation would make the chance of war even greater in the future</span>. If Pyongyang believes that it can sink a South Korean ship without consequence, what might the Kim regime do next?</u> <u>Yet Seoul finds its future being decided at least in part in Washington</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, where America’s, not South Korea’s, interests understandably are treated as paramount. The devastated land that emerged from the Korean War had no choice but to place its security in America’s hands. But the ROK today? In the short-term the U.S. and South Korea are tied together militarily. Their responses to the sinking of the Cheonan will reflect that relationship. However, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">both sides should use this crisis to rethink an alliance</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that has outgrown its original security justification. </span><u>There is much on which both nations should work together in the future, including military operations</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">where both countries have interests at stake. Such cooperation is not advanced by today’s antiquated alliance. Neither the ROK nor the United States is well-served by a relationship where South Korea’s fate is decided in Washington. Especially more than a half century after the end of the Korean War and two decades after the end of the Cold War. It’s time to turn South Korea’s defense over to the South Korean people. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The vortex of Korean politics can make even Donald Rumsfeld sound like the most radical Korean peace activist. &quot;After the cold war,&quot; he declared on June 3, &quot;U.S. forces have been stationed in South Korea for too long.&quot; The occasion was the announcement of the largest U.S. troop reductions from the Korean peninsula since the Korean War armistice, which took place 51 years ago this month. The Pentagon is withdrawing one-third of its forces from South Korea and sending a portion of them to Iraq. Since this announcement comes at a time not of relative tranquility but rather of heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea, some critics have charged the Bush administration with sacrificing security in East Asia on the altar of its Iraq policy. &quot;Scavenging troops from South Korea,&quot; writes Jon Wolfstahl in the International Herald Tribune, &quot;sends exactly the wrong signal at the wrong time to U.S. allies and adversaries alike.&quot; These critics are missing the point. American troops are no longer needed on the Korean peninsula. The Bush administration's only mistake is in not going far enough. </span><u>An even more dramatic <span style="background-color: yellow;">withdrawal of U.S. troops would</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not compromise security and could even </span><strong><u>help <span style="background-color: yellow;">unknot the ongoing negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang</span>.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Pentagon announcement comes just before a third round of Six-Party Talks that bring together the United States, North and South Korea, China, Japan, and Russia. The previous two rounds went nowhere and expectations for this third round are low. The United States is insisting on CVID or the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of North Korea's nuclear programs – before any substantive compromise can be hammered out. Having declared North Korea beyond the pale, the Bush administration is stuck in a theological hole: any form of negotiations looks suspiciously like &quot;supping with the Devil.&quot; North Korea, meanwhile, has broached various scenarios whereby they freeze and then dismantle their programs in exchange for energy, economic incentives, security guarantees, or a mixture of the three. It might seem strange that the United States is reducing its military footprint on the Korean peninsula at this juncture. The Pentagon points out that the current plan has been on the drawing board since the end of the Cold War. Troops in fixed positions with slow-moving tanks, according to the Pentagon, fight yesterday's wars. Today's conflicts require rapid response units that can move quickly and over long distances. U.S. military presence in Korea – as well as in Japan – is being refashioned for the instantaneous demands of the virtual age and to intervene in areas further south as part of the &quot;war on terrorism.&quot; This restructuring was first delayed in the early 1990s during the first nuclear crisis between the United States and North Korea. Why, during a second and potentially more serious crisis, is the restructuring moving forward? Certainly the immediate need for troops in the Iraq occupation is one reason. The deeper issue, however, is the declining utility of American troops on the Korean peninsula. North Korea's conventional forces have deteriorated in strength over the last twenty years, even as Pyongyang has directed large portions of its stagnant government budget toward the military. South Korea's armed forces, which include 690,000 troops, have meanwhile steadily improved its capability. Because of the high cost of fuel and the lack of critical spare parts, North Korean military pilots train 13 hours a year, which is what an American pilot easily clocks in a month. Or to give another example of the growing disparity of forces, South Korea has the luxury to spend between ten and one hundred times more per soldier for their equipment and other needs. Given the dramatic reversal of comparative strength between North and South, the tiny U.S. contingent – around 5 percent of South Korean troop strength – does not bring much to the table. The U.S. decision in 2003 to redeploy U.S. forces away from the DMZ has eliminated their function as a tripwire, the first line of defense against a North Korean invasion. Military boosters emphasize the symbolic value of U.S. troops in demonstrating the unwavering commitment of the United States to its alliance with South Korea and to deter any North Korean attack on the South. But even this symbolism has become drained of meaning. South Korea under Roh Moo-Hyun wants more equality in its relations with the United States, which translates into greater control over military affairs. Younger South Koreans now see the United States – or, to be more precise, the trigger-happy unilateralism of the Bush administration – as more dangerous than North Korea. U.S. deterrent capacity, meanwhile, now resides in firepower based largely outside the peninsula, such as the Fifth Air Force and the Seventh Fleet, both based in Japan. As it did fifty years ago, U.S. airpower can reduce North Korea to rubble. North Korean leaders recognize that any attack they might launch across the DMZ would thus be suicidal. The presence of the remaining 25,000 U.S. troops does not alter this calculus. Although they have only a minor military function and declining symbolic value, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the remaining</span> U.S. <span style="background-color: yellow;">troops</span> on the Korean peninsula <span style="background-color: yellow;">can play a vital new role: bargaining chip. North Korea has argued that it is under threat of U.S. attack and considers U.S. troops in South Korea a longstanding provocation</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> So </span><u>let's try something new by putting U.S. troop presence on the negotiating table.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> With the advice and consent of our South Korean allies, the Bush administration should offer a timetable for the removal of all U.S. troops from the peninsula. A Democrat would be hard pressed to offer such a deal. When Jimmy Carter tried to withdraw U.S. troops from the peninsula, he hit major resistance from Washington insiders. Only the hawks in Washington have the political capital to push through a complete withdrawal. The complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea would certainly have its drawbacks. South Korea is spending more now on its defense than ever before and the Defense Ministry has called for an additional 13 percent increase in the military budget to compensate for the disappearing U.S. troops. The peace movement in Japan and Okinawa also want to bid farewell to U.S. troops, so the shifting of U.S. forces eastward, while a boon for the Korean peace movement, would not necessarily be a plus for the region as a whole. Still, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">U.S. troop withdrawal</span> from the Korean peninsula <span style="background-color: yellow;">would be such an </span></u><strong><u>enormous step toward resolving inter-Korean tensions</u></strong> <u>that the benefits outweigh the costs.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Beset on all sides for its Iraq policy, the Bush administration needs a foreign policy victory. It needs to demonstrate that it isn't ignoring the Korean peninsula. And it needs to show the world that the United States, if only after 51 years, does eventually bring home its troops. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">What I do know is that U.S. was drawn into the Korean Peninsula during the Cold War and as part of an effort to contain the threat of Communist military aggression -- in the form of Communist China -- in Northeast Asia. Despite the fact that the Cold War ended a while ago (that I also know) </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">U.S. military commitment</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><u>was formalized through a security agreement with South Korea and is <span style="background-color: yellow;">demonstrated by</span> the continuing presence of <span style="background-color: yellow;">37,000</span> U.S. <span style="background-color: yellow;">troops in that country</span> is still in place</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The main threat that is being raised as a way of justifying this U.S. military commitment and presence is that of North Korea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In particular, Pyongyang's drive to develop nuclear military capability has become the main rationale for U.S. military intervention in the Korean Peninsula. </span><u>Ironically, one of <span style="background-color: yellow;">the reasons that North Korea has taken the nuclear military direction has to do with legitimate concerns</span> -- considering U.S. policies in Iraq and elsewhere -- <span style="background-color: yellow;">over a possible U.S. attempt to do a &quot;regime change&quot; in Pyongyang</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In any case, the main threat that North Korea is posing today is to its neighbors in northeast Asia. There is the long-term concern over the economic problems, including the flow of refugees into South Korea and China that could follow the collapse of North Korean. And there is no reason why Japan and South Korea should not be worried over the rise of a nuclear North Korea. Indeed, these worst-case-scenarios reflect what should be seen as direct threat to the core national interests of South Korea, Japan -- and China -- and not to that of the U.S. It is not difficult to imagine the U.S. response if the central government in Mexico disintegrates and/or if Chavez's Venezuela goes nuclear. But </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Korea is not in America's strategic backyard but in China's</span>. A China that is trying to project itself as a responsible regional power in East Asia should be concerned that Japan and South Korea would have no other choice but to develop their nuclear military capability --</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> an idea that has been opposed by Washington -- </span><u>in order <span style="background-color: yellow;">to deter a nuclear North Korea</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ruled by the Kim Dynasty. So in a way, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the most effective way for the U.S. to help achieve a stable balance of power in the Korean Peninsula is</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">not by sending more war ships to South Korea but </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">by providing incentives to the Chinese to stop making excuses for the North</span> Koreans</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- not to mention honoring Dear Leader during his visit to Beijing -- and to start &quot;doing something&quot; about North Korea. Washington could help by working with Seoul and Tokyo -- and Beijing -- in drawing an outline for a timeline for a nuclear military disarmament of North Korea as part of a package deal involving economic assistance to the North as well as process of diplomatic détente with that government, including ties with Washington (and perhaps eventually the peaceful reunification of the peninsula). There is no doubt that it is China, as Pyongyang's only regional (and global) patron, that would have to play the main role in forcing North Korea to accept such a deal. </span><u>The alternative should not be an all-out war in the Korean Peninsula involving U.S. troops, but an American &quot;green light&quot; to Seoul and Tokyo to take all the necessary steps to protect their security</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- including the nuclear military option. And while I don't know many things, </span><u>I am quite sure that <span style="background-color: yellow;">the prospect of Japan and South Korea going nuclear will make it</span> more <span style="background-color: yellow;">likely</span> than not <span style="background-color: yellow;">that China will finally start acting like </span>the <span style="background-color: yellow;">responsible regional power</span> that it claims to be.</u><br />

<span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">C</span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">hina</span> yesterday <span style="background-color: yellow;">called for emergency</span> direct <span style="background-color: yellow;">diplomacy with North Korea</span> in order to lower escalating tensions following last week's artillery attack on South Korea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (see GSN, Nov. 24). </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">However, the United States</span> and its allies <span style="background-color: yellow;">said now is not the time</span> to address Pyongyang's demands <span style="background-color: yellow;">for new six-party talks</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">North Korea's shelling of the inhabited South Korean island of Yeonpyeong resulted in the deaths of several soldiers and civilians and injuries to nearly 20 more. The incident directly followed news from Washington that Pyongyang revealed to visiting U.S. experts earlier this month that it had covertly built a large-scale advanced uranium enrichment facility at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, the Wall Street Journal reported. The two events have renewed international attention on the North Korean nuclear impasse. Beijing dispatched its senior foreign affairs official to lead a delegation to Seoul over the weekend for talks on the crisis. However, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak told the Chinese visitors that it was not the &quot;right time&quot; to relaunch long-stalled six-nation talks aimed at the permament denuclearization of North Korea, according to an administration official. The nuclear talks involve China, Japan, the two Koreas, Russia and the United States. They were last held almost two years ago. Pyongyang withdrew from the negotiations in April 2009 and one month later carried out its second nuclear weapons test, an action for which it was punished with heightened U.N. Security Council sanctions. The North for some time has declared its willingness to return to the nuclear talks. However, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo are leery of returning to a negotiating framework that has been used by the North in the past as a means to win international concessions only to later resume work on its nuclear weapons program. The three allies have called on Pyongyang to demonstrate its &quot;sincere&quot; commitment to nuclear disarmament before they will agree to resume negotiations. China is North Korea's strongest foreign ally and chief economic benefactor. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Beijing's continued support of</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">Kim Jong Il</span> regime <span style="background-color: yellow;">is</span> frequently cited in Washington as <span style="background-color: yellow;">the only thing keeping the Stalinist government from collapsing</span>. Because of this, <span style="background-color: yellow;">China has</span> come under growing criticism from the international community to <span style="background-color: yellow;">do more to press North Korea over its belligerent behavior</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;It's hard to know why China doesn't push harder,&quot; Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a CNN interview aired yesterday. &quot;They clearly are interested in this -- in the region not spinning out of control -- so my sense is they try to control this guy, and I'm not sure he is controllable.&quot; Lee yesterday told Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo in blunt remarks that China must take a &quot;more fair and responsible position&quot; on peninsula affairs and leave Cold War-era considerations behind, according to presidential spokesman Hong Sang-pyo. In a television address today, Lee pledged North Korea &quot;would pay a price&quot; for any future hostilities and said that &quot;more endurance and forgiveness would only result in bigger provocations&quot; (Fairclough/Ramstad, Wall Street Journal I, Nov. 28). Japan today dismissed Beijing's call for direct talks with North Korea. Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said it would be &quot;unacceptable for us to hold six-party talks only because North Korea has gone amok,&quot; the Wall Street Journal reported (Yuka Hayashi, Wall Street Journal II, Nov. 29). The United States has yet to give a response to China's call for emergency talks, saying it would carry out discussions with the South Korean government first, Reuters reported. A high-ranking Pyongyang official voiced doubts about Beijing's initiative to engage in discussions. While the North has not responded to China's call, the unidentified official told Kyodo News that countries involved in the latest incident should meet for talks first (Laurence/Choonsik, Reuters, Nov. 29). </span><u>While urging that the two Koreas to refrain from actions that would raise tensions on the peninsula, China has abstained from condemning Pyongyang's shelling of the South Korean island, indicating that Beijing will refuse</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the urging of Washington and other states </span><u>to punish the North</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the Los Angeles Times reported last Thursday. North Korea's presumed possession of the nuclear bomb, its large arsenal of chemical weapons and a massive standing army make a military assault on the isolated state an unattractive option, according to reports. The United States and much of the international community have already drastically curtailed trade relations with the Stalinist state. In the White House view, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">China remains the only nation to have sway over the North and the only hope of producing a change in the Korean nuclear impasse. &quot;China is pivotal to moving North Korea in a fundamentally different direction</span>,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;You can go [to] the U.N. Security Council or call for a five-party meeting (minus North Korea). But first you've got to go after China,&quot; said Victor Cha, point man for North Korean policy during the Bush administration. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Could the current economic crisis affecting this country and the world lead to another world war? The answer may be found by looking back in history. </span><u>One of the causes of World War I was the economic rivalry that existed between the nations of Europe.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In the 19th century France and Great Britain became wealthy through colonialism and the control of foreign resources. This forced other up-and-coming nations (such as Germany) to be more competitive in world trade which led to rivalries and ultimately, to war. </span><u><span style="background-color: aqua;">After the Great Depression ruined the economies of Europe</span> in the 1930s, <span style="background-color: aqua;">fascist movements arose to seek</span> economic and social <span style="background-color: aqua;">control</span>. From there fanatics like <span style="background-color: aqua;">Hitler and Mussolini took over</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Germany and Italy and led them both into World War II.</span> <u>With most of North America and Western Europe currently experiencing a recession, will competition for resources and economic rivalries with the Middle East, Asia, or South American cause another world war?</u> <strong><u><span style="background-color: aqua;">Add in nuclear weapons and Islamic fundamentalism and things look even worse. </span></u></strong><u>Hopefully the economy gets better before it gets worse and the terrifying possibility of World War III is averted.

If North Korea refuses to engage in arms control and to rid itself of WMD, the international community must be prepared to deal with a wide range of threats, including those posed by Pyongyang’s chemical and biological weapons capabilities. </span><u>Unclassified estimates of the chemical weapons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (CW) </span><u>arsenal are imprecise, but</u> <strong><u>the consensus</u></strong> <u>is that the</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Korean People’s Army </span><u>(KPA) possesses 2,500-5,000 tons,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> including mustard, phosgene, blood agents, sarin, tabun and V-agents (persistent nerve agents<span style="background-color: aqua;">). </span></span><u><span style="background-color: aqua;">The stockpile</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> does not appear to be increasing but </span><u><span style="background-color: aqua;">is </span></u><strong><u>already sufficient</u></strong> <u>to inflict massive civilian casualties on South Korea.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The North’s CW can be delivered with long-range artillery, multiple rocket launchers, FROGs (free rocket over ground), ballistic missiles, aircraft and naval vessels. North Korean military doctrine emphasises quick offensive strikes to break through enemy defences in order to achieve national military objectives before the U.S. can intervene effectively on behalf of its South Korean ally. However, </span><u><span style="background-color: aqua;">the North’s conventional military capabilities are declining</span> against those of its potential foes, <span style="background-color: aqua;">so the leadership is likely to rely on asymmetric capabilities</span> for its national security objectives. <span style="background-color: aqua;">This</span> strategy poses a significant danger because it <span style="background-color: aqua;">risks </span></u><strong><u>deliberate, accidental or unauthorised WMD attacks or incidents.</u></strong> <u>North Korea has not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (CWC) but has signed the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) as well as the Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in war. The government denies having CW or biological weapons (BW) programs but claims to be threatened by South Korean and U.S. CBW even though Seoul and Washington are parties to the CWC, BTWC and the Geneva Protocol. South Korea had a CW program but completed the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile in 2008 and is in com- pliance with all its CBW arms control commitments. Despite a dismal economy, the North Korean regime appears stable. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">An international norm against</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> chemical and </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">biological weapons has emerged, but</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a few nations and </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">terrorist groups still seek</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to acquire </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">them.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Most states can produce chemical weapons on their own if they choose to, but North Korea could provide materials or technology for integrating CW munitions with delivery systems to shorten developmen- tal and deployment timelines. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The North’s</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> biotechnol- ogy capability is rudimentary, but </span><u>any biological agents or <span style="background-color: yellow;">BW technology</span> in its possession <span style="background-color: yellow;">would be highly valued.

Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons</span></u> <u>because <span style="background-color: yellow;">very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. </span><u>With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Potentially worse than that, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">bio-engineered agents</span></u> <u>by the hundreds with no known cure <span style="background-color: yellow;">could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could</span> persistent <span style="background-color: yellow;">radiation.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE. Ironically, the Bush administration has just changed the U.S. nuclear doctrine to allow nuclear retaliation against threats upon allies by conventional weapons. The past doctrine allowed such use only as a last resort when our nation’s survival was at stake. Will the new policy also allow easier use of US bioweapons? How slippery is this slope? Against this tendency can be posed a rational alternative policy<span style="background-color: yellow;">. </span></span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">To preclude possibilities of human extinction</span></u><u>, &quot;patriotism&quot; needs to be redefined to <span style="background-color: yellow;">make humanity’s survival primary and absolute</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Even if we lose our cherished freedom, our sovereignty, our government or our Constitution, where there is life, there is hope. What good is anything else if humanity is extinguished? This concept should be promoted to the center of national debate.. For example, for sake of argument, suppose the ancient Israelites developed defensive bioweapons of mass destruction when they were enslaved by Egypt. Then suppose these weapons were released by design or accident and wiped everybody out? As bad as slavery is, extinction is worse. Our generation, our century, our epoch needs to take the long view. </span><u>We</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> truly </span><u>hold in our hands the precious gift of all future life.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Empires may come and go, but who are the honored custodians of life on earth? Temporal politicians? Corporate competitors? Strategic brinksmen? Military gamers? Inflated egos dripping with testosterone? How can any sane person believe that national sovereignty is more important than survival of the species? Now that extinction is possible, our slogan should be &quot;Where there is life, there is hope.&quot; No government, no economic system, no national pride, no religion, no political system can be placed above human survival. The egos of leaders must not blind us. The adrenaline and vengeance of a fight must not blind us. The game is over. If patriotism would extinguish humanity, then patriotism is the highest of all crimes. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Looking from this perspective, </span><u>one would also realise the fundamental <span style="background-color: yellow;">differences between Japan’s and China’s perspectives on evolving regionalism</span> in East Asia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, including the concept of an <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/tag/eac/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">East Asian Community</a>. </span><u>China’s regional outlook</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and its policies </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">are still conditioned</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, at the deepest level, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">by</span> its preoccupation with the modern elements of diplomacy and international politics, including strong nationalism, a sense of <span style="background-color: yellow;">rivalry with the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span>tates, an unprecedented pace and scale of military modernisation, and preoccupation with territorial integrity</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Japan’s perspective on East Asian regionalism</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and its interests therein, in contrast, </span><u>are essentially post-industrial, including commitment to non-traditional security issues such as human security, problems common to rapidly evolving civil societies, and issues associated with aging societies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Of course, there are still modern elements in Japanese society and politics, which particularly tend to surface in an emotional vicious cycle over historical and territorial issues between <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/01/05/a-new-start-for-japan-china-relations/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Japan and China</a>. The main story in the evolution of Japanese diplomacy and thinking toward East Asian regionalism, however, has been largely, if not exclusively, a post-modern and post-industrial one. The first critical and explicit manifestation of this tendency was Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi’s policy speech in January 2002 proposing the establishment of an East Asian Community. Koizumi said to the audience in Singapore that, starting from Japan-ASEAN cooperation, the countries of ASEAN, Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand will be core members of such a community. </span><u>The Koizumi speech actually ignited a process of conceptual competition between China and Japan</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In particular, the inclusion of Australia and New Zealand embodied the line of division between the two. In the Japanese thinking, there still remains a concern about a China-centered process of community-building possibly developing into a closed region, reflecting Chinese preoccupation with modern values and interests such as national sovereignty and a sense of strategic rivalry vis-à-vis the United States over the long run. In this Japanese conception, the inclusion of Australia and New Zealand holds a double function. First, they provide a venting channel leading to the United States as a security anchor in East Asia, an important foundation of an East Asian Community from the Japanese perspective. Secondly, the membership of Australia and New Zealand is also important from the point of view of universal values that will sustain, as well as keep open, the basis of an East Asian Community to the rest of the world. Therefore, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">behind the competition over</span> the primary institution for community building between the <span style="background-color: yellow;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aseansec.org/4918.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__ASEAN+3__</a></span> formula, on the one hand, and <span style="background-color: yellow;">the East Asian Summit or</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">ASEAN+6</span> on the other, <span style="background-color: yellow;">lies this conceptual rivalry</span>, if not geopolitical conflict, <span style="background-color: yellow;">between Japan and China</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This should be a healthy competition in which the other East Asian nations, including </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the Japanese and the Chinese, would be involved through constructive dialogue and debate</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For such diplomatic approaches by Japan toward East Asia, the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/australia/joint0703.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation</a>, signed in March 2007, has important meanings. The actual context of the declaration reveals that the agreement is the embodiment of security cooperation between countries concerned about a set of non-traditional security and political issues. The declaration has no elements regarding traditional security such as territorial integrity or balance of power considerations. It specifically mentions Japan-Australia cooperation on non-traditional security issues, including law enforcement to combat transnational crime, disarmament and counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, peace operations, and humanitarian relief operations. From the perspective advanced in this essay, one would realise that similar </span><u>security cooperation should not be entirely impossible between Japan and South Korea. Indeed, <span style="background-color: yellow;">if Japan and South Korea can establish a genuinely cooperative relationship as true equals</span> located between the United States and China, <span style="background-color: yellow;">this will become an </span></u><strong><u>epoch-making trigger for a paradigm shift</u></strong> <u>in East Asian regionalism</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Under the dominant realities today, this perspective may sound rather normative. Nonetheless, it is not entirely without substance, </span><u>as evidenced by rapidly expanding civil society exchanges between Japan and South Korea and the coordination of alliance policies toward the United States</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Although it is a bit too early to judge where the new diplomacy by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) will go, there are indications that </span><u>this sort of paradigm shift may not be entirely impossible in the coming years</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Of</span> particular <span style="background-color: yellow;">importance is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama’s emphasis on </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan’s diplomacy toward</span> neighboring countries, i.e., <span style="background-color: yellow;">South Korea and China, in the</span> overall <span style="background-color: yellow;">context of an East Asian Community</span> concept. The idea is to start the community-building efforts with Japan’s most troubled relationships, i.e. those with South Korea and China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and his rather explicit approach to the history problems represents an important initiative in this overall context of a new East Asian diplomacy rather than simply in a bilateral context. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is fair to say that </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">China has tried to moderate obstacles</span> in its bilateral relations <span style="background-color: yellow;">with Japan</span> by way of positioning its Japan policy as a part of its multilateral diplomacy in East Asia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In other words, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">China put great importance on</span> promoting regional cooperation in East Asia and then contemplated a foreign policy toward Japan with a view to <span style="background-color: yellow;">strengthening East Asia cooperation</span>, which allowed the Chinese government to maintain <span style="background-color: yellow;">cooperative relations with Japan</span> that <span style="background-color: yellow;">were necessary for advancing regional cooperation</span> and containing negative influences from controversial disputes with Japan within the bilateral scheme</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As to this kind of relationship between China’s regional policy and its Japan policy, Zhang Yunling, director of the Center for AsiaPacific Studies, China Academy of Social Sciences, argues that </span><u>one of <span style="background-color: yellow;">the political implications of East Asian cooperation is to improve the Sino-Japanese relationship through</span> putting both countries in a common mechanism of <span style="background-color: yellow;">regional cooperation</span>, which can play the role of a “lubricant” for smoothing acrimonious relations between Beijing and Tokyo</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.6 Men Honghua, professor at the Central Party School, points out that </span><u>China and Japan realize that the most effective way to secure their core national interests is to play the role of responsible major powers in a regional framework by taking responsibility as stakeholders</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this way, </span><u>East Asian cooperation can provide the two countries with more routes toward their cooperation and dialogue</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.7 In this respect, it is imperative that China’s policy toward East Asia is investigated in order to understand the future direction of its Japan policy. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Six decades have passed since World War II ended, but you wouldn’t know it from relations between </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">South Korea and Japan</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The two leading democratic, capitalist powers in East Asia – both close US allies – </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">have been blustering over the status of</span> 33 barren but contested blocks of <span style="background-color: yellow;">rock</span>. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Cooperation</span> over truly important issues, such as denuclearizing North Korea and channeling Chinese ambitions in a positive direction, <span style="background-color: yellow;">has taken a back seat to</span> immature <span style="background-color: yellow;">political posturing</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This irresponsible behavior is made possible by Washington’s continued defense of both nations. Imperial Japan gained dominant influence in the peninsular kingdom in the late 1800s and formally annexed Korea as a colony in 1910. Tokyo’s policies were characteristically brutal: Korean culture was suppressed, Korean names were outlawed, and Korean labor was conscripted. During World War II the Japanese took Koreans as &quot;comfort women&quot; for Japanese soldiers on break from conquering East Asia and the Pacific. It’s no wonder that anti-Japanese feeling, strong throughout most of the region, was especially intense in Korea. Indeed, it was one of the few unifying features of a peninsula divided by the US and Soviet Union in 1945. These feelings were understandable, but the statute of limitations has run out. Japan’s wartime leaders all died long ago. Even most of the &quot;grunts&quot; are dead. The militaristic imperial order, devastated by Tokyo’s defeat, died along with them. The US disarmed Japan and imposed a &quot;peace constitution,&quot; which technically outlaws any military. Tokyo’s neighbors applauded, but American policymakers soon reconsidered. After the Chinese Revolution, Washington faced two large communist rivals in East Asia. In contrast, America’s allies were marginal: Australia and New Zealand small and distant, the Republic of Korea an economic and political wreck, the Philippines a third world state. Japan was America’s only potential powerful friend in Asia during the Cold War’s early years. Anti-Japanese taunts became a useful political tactic for political elites in the ROK and elsewhere, such as Singapore. Secure beneath America’s protective umbrella, these countries demanded that Tokyo eschew even the ability to defend itself. Japan didn’t help matters, with assorted politicians periodically sounding off on the alleged benefits of colonialism in Korea and visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, at which more than a thousand convicted war criminals are interred. Relations between South Korea and Japan have improved in recent years. Dissident Kim Dae-jung took refuge in Japan decades ago; he encouraged more positive bilateral ties after he was elected ROK president in 1997. Moreover, the horrifying brutality and criminality of the North Korean government eroded the support, financial as well as political, of Pyongyang by many ethnic Koreans living in Japan, most of whom had come from the North. Kim’s successor, Roh Moo-hyun, attempted to use anti-Japanese feeling to bolster his fading popularity, but President Lee Myun-bak, elected last December, advocated improving relations. Alas, the controversy over the Takeshima (Japanese name)/Dokdo (Korean name) Islands (or Liancourt Rocks in the West) has pushed relations backwards. (The surrounding waters are commonly known as the Sea of Japan, except in Korea, which calls them the East Sea. Just two Koreans, an octopus fisherman and his wife, live permanently on the assorted outcroppings – 56 acres in all – but every day hundreds of South Koreans visit. The voyage takes several hours and the unpredictable waves often prevent anyone from landing. Even when the sea cooperates, the visitors typically stay only 20 minutes. Nevertheless, 80,000 South Koreans have made the trek so far this year, a testament to the frivolous petulance which sometimes captures the popular psyche of the Republic of Korea. The competing claims are tied up with Tokyo’s military victory over Russia and – the cause of the issue’s emotional sensitivity in Korea – Japan’s subsequent takeover of the Korean peninsula. America occupied both the ROK and Japan at the end of World War II, but left the issue unresolved. South Korea installed a small police garrison in the 1950s to stake its claim and rejected Tokyo’s offer to bring the issue to the International Court of Justice. The two countries set the issue aside when they normalized relations in 1965, but controversy flared in 2005 when the government of Shimane prefecture in Japan declared Takeshima Day, celebrating Tokyo’s claim. In July the Japanese Ministry of Education issued a new manual for teachers and textbook publishers asserting Tokyo’s rightful ownership. Seoul called it &quot;an intolerable act,&quot; temporarily recalled its ambassador from Japan, canceled a scheduled meeting between the two countries’ foreign ministers, and sent Prime Minister Han Seung-soo to the islands. South Korean citizens demonstrated. The South even conducted military exercises nearby – to prepare for any Japanese provocation, noted Defense Minister Lee Sang-hee. North Korea, which has largely ignored the issue (the islands are much closer to the South), added its angry voice. The US was drawn into the controversy. The US Board on Geographic Names changed its listing of the islands from South Korean to &quot;undesignated sovereignty.&quot; The ROK predictably protested and, faced with the threat of popular protests during President George W. Bush’s planned visit to Seoul in early August, the White House ordered the Board to reverse itself. (A similar controversy enveloped the Library of Congress, which planned on listing the islets as Liancourt Rocks, before backing down under pressure.) In August Seoul arranged an international press delegation to Dokdo/Takeshima to build public support. South Korea says it may construct a marine science research station and village on the rocks next year. Hong Joon-pyo, an official in the ruling Grand National Party, sought to rally the ROK against &quot;the Japanese ambition for territorial aggression.&quot; Twenty-four-year-old Kim Eun-taek, a police conscript stationed on the islands, spoke for many of his countrymen when he told the <em>New York Times</em>: &quot;I feel immensely proud. Not every South Korean gets a chance to guard the easternmost territory of our nation. Besides, I never liked the Japanese.&quot; It seems inconceivable that either nation would ever use military force to advance its claim, but both send naval patrols into the surrounding waters. Still,</span> <u>the more practical consequence of the controversy is to poison relations between the two countries</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. During abortive negotiations between the two states, one official observed: &quot;We would be better off if we just blow up the islands.&quot; He was right. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The advantages of cooperation between Japan and South Korea are obvious</span>. Economic ties are strong and the two are important trading partners. There is perhaps even greater cause to work together to promote their mutual security</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. North Korea remains an unpredictable and hostile force, especially with the status of dictator &quot;Dear Leader&quot; Kim Jong-il in question. China’s influence is growing, and while Beijing has been assertive rather than aggressive so far, </span><u>both South Korea and Japan would be more secure if they acted in tandem on geopolitical issues</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">neither feels much pressure to do so as long as Washington provides</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> both security guarantees and</span> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">military garrisons</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Indeed, </span><u>Seoul</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> cheerfully </span><u>subsidizes North Korea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as it constructs a nuclear arsenal, </span><u>while lobbying America to maintain its troop presence</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – and treating Japan as a potential threat. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The US should say no more</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>With the end of the Cold War the case for continued <span style="background-color: yellow;">American military domination</span> of East Asia disappeared. That policy <span style="background-color: yellow;">no longer serves US</span> security <span style="background-color: yellow;">interests, since</span> its <span style="background-color: yellow;">allies are</span> well <span style="background-color: yellow;">able to</span> defend themselves, and to <span style="background-color: yellow;">cooperate</span> with each other in doing so. Moreover, <span style="background-color: yellow;">attempting to maintain</span> Washington’s military <span style="background-color: yellow;">hegemony along China’s border is unsustainable</span>, as Beijing grows wealthier and more influential</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Escaping disputes like the South Korean-Japanese quarrel over who owns 33 worthless bits of rock a world away from America would be an added benefit of disengagement. </span><u>It’s time for Tokyo and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> especially </span><u>Seoul to</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> behave like serious members of the international community rather than spoiled teenagers, and </span><u>provide responsible leadership in East Asia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<strong>Watanabe, September 29, 2010</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – special to the Asahi Shimbun (Akio, “COMMENTARY/ No winners in Japan-China trawler showdown,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201009280411.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201009280411.html</a>) </span><br />

<u>China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> brought onto itself major negative fallout. For one thing, it </span><u>lost the feelings of expectation and trust toward China that the Japanese public was beginning to hold</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> recently. The other negative aspect is that China demonstrated to Asian nations and the world just how rough Chinese diplomacy really was. It would be a major mistake for China to be happy about the situation. On the other hand, it cannot be called a victory for Japanese diplomacy, either. Releasing the captain when both the prime minister and foreign minister were not in Japan was a sloppy handling of the matter. Although prosecutors said they made the decision independently, that was not possible because core elements of the government must have been involved. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Throughout the</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> entire </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">incident, the Japanese government lacked agility</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Considering China's recent unilateral actions in the South China Sea, <span style="background-color: yellow;">there was a need to prepare for the occurrence of such an incident in Japan's territorial waters</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, did Japan conduct hypothetical tests and prepare for such possibilities? What actually happened was a hasty decision at a crucial juncture. In that sense, Japan's diplomacy was unprofessional. While it is unclear who the victor is, it is very evident what was lost due to the incident. Although Japan said it would &quot;proceed in an orderly manner&quot; and &quot;handle the matter calmly,&quot; that was insufficient. </span><u>What should have been the basis of its actions was a Japan-China relationship that was disciplined and that followed the solid principle that Japan &quot;would not allow any coercive change in the status quo.&quot;</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In that sense, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the loser in this incident can be said to be a</span> &quot;disciplined <span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan-China relationship</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; Seen objectively, the Senkaku Islands are under the effective control of Japan. There is no legal or historical basis for China's argument that the islands are its territory. Trying to change that status by going against international law, treaties and international agreements is an act that disrupts order and must be said to lie outside a &quot;disciplined Japan-China relationship.&quot; China, therefore, has primary responsibility for the incident. However, Japan must also bear major responsibility. Has the Japanese government clearly made known its position to &quot;not allow any coercive change in the status quo?&quot; Were the political will and the strength of that will sufficient? Moreover, did Japan prepare the &quot;power&quot; that would be needed to support that will? In fact, Japan had neither a clear will nor the sufficient posture to persist with that will. </span><u>The incident has not reached a conclusion, yet</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What the Japanese government has to do is clarify its political will by stating what its position is and to lay out the principles that will be employed for the resolution of the issue. Beyond that, the issue becomes one of diplomatic technique, and there would be various ways of proceeding. However, </span><u>if Japan continues taking convenient measures without clear principles in place, that will only hurt a disciplined Japan-China relationship</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Sufficient consideration should be given to this point. </span><u>This will be an important precedent for the nations that are feeling a threat from the heavy-handed acts of China in the South China Sea.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In that sense, Japanese diplomacy must do its best. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">If Japan-China relations should become even more acrimonious, voices might arise in Japan calling for a more robust, </span></u><strong><u>military response</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Sino-Japanese relations revolve around acute sensitivities</span>.

Both Japan and China are powerful countries. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Their relationship</span> is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> an ancient relationship, but it is often </span><u>held together by a very weak thread that <span style="background-color: yellow;">can be broken at any time on any issue</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This creates many challenges, not only for Japan and China, but also for the many nations which maintain important relations with both of them. </span><u>A <span style="background-color: yellow;">Sino-Japanese rivalry that gets out of hand would present a formidable destabilizing element that would confuse the policies of</span> many <span style="background-color: yellow;">nearby nations</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In spite of the great need for a constructive Sino-Japanese relationship, these nations have a tendency to clash even on rather marginal issues. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">In</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> regard to the highly emotional, territorial issue presented by </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the Senkaku / Diaoyu Islands dispute</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, international law in fact provides more questions than answers. </span><u>More <span style="background-color: yellow;">assertive military policies by either side could easily trigger a large-scale conflict that would benefit no nation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Clearly, </span><u>the <span style="background-color: yellow;">recent confrontation over a Chinese fishing boat captain</span> has been a setback to efforts to deal with the islands issue peacefully and has <span style="background-color: yellow;">led to an overall deterioration in Japan-China relations</span>.</u><br />

<strong>The impact is nuclear war</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Kennedy: Over the past two or three decades, many Asian nations have increased their defense budgets, while European countries have done otherwise. During this time, </span><u>there have been many flash points in Asia, such North Korea, Taiwan and Kashmir. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Some Asian countries have </span></u><strong><u>developed nuclear weapons</u></strong><u>,</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">as contrasted with few Europeans who even want nuclear power stations today. We have good reason to feel worried that </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Asia could become a tinderbox</span></u></strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;"> should there be any conflict in disputed territories</span></u> <u>like the Spratly Islands and an autistic</u> <u>North Korean regime that does not bother to understand the outside world.</u> <u>Taiwan is often rash to provoke Beijing,</u> <u>while the</u> <u>Kashmir conflict</u> <u>could grow into an India-Pakistan war. There is great concern about how <span style="background-color: yellow;">we should ensure that bitter rivalries in the Asia</span>n part of the globe <span style="background-color: yellow;">will not bring down a system that is emerging in the world now</span></u><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">. We do not want a repeat of 1914.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">I am concerned that an armed conflict might arise in South or East Asia in 2008, for example, and bring down the credit, financial flow and capital in the region. </span><br />

<br />
<u><span style="background-color: yellow;">If such a clash occurred, it would pose a serious dilemma for the United States. The U.S. commitment to defend Japan</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, enshrined in Article 5 of the Mutual Security Treaty, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">applies to “territories under the administration of Japan.” The Senkaku</span>/Diaoyu <span style="background-color: yellow;">Islands are under Japan’s administrative control</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even though Washington takes no position on which state (China or Japan) has sovereignty over them under international law. Successive </span><u>U.<span style="background-color: yellow;">S. administrations have reaffirmed that application</span>, suggesting that the United States would be legally obligated to assist Japan if the People’s Liberation Army attacked or seized the islands</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the more ambiguous contingency of a fight over oil and gas fields in the East China Sea, Washington would not be legally obligated to render assistance to Japan, but </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Tokyo</span></u> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">would</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> likely </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">pressure it to do so</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">In any clash over</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the islands or some other part of </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the East China Sea that could not be immediately contained, Tokyo would</span> thus <span style="background-color: yellow;">look to Washington</span> for help</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in standing up to China’s probable reliance on coercive diplomacy. Washington seeks good relations with both China and Japan. It does not want to get drawn into a conflict between the two, especially one that it believed was not necessary to protect the vital interests of either. A Senkaku scenario is not, from the U.S. perspective, the issue where the American commitment to Japan is put to the test. But </span><u>Washington would understand that not responding would impose serious political costs on its relations with Tokyo and would raise questions about U.S. credibility more broadly among other states that depend on the United States for their security. Congressional and public opinion would probably favor Japan or, at least, oppose China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">THE C ONTINGENCY </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A new</span> and potentially dangerous <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">crisis could erupt in Korea over the next twelve to eighteen months for at least three reasons</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">First,</span> although tensions have subsided in the wake of the Cheonan incident, an atmosphere of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">recrimination and mistrust remains</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">U.S. and</span> Republic of Korea (<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">ROK) forces are on high alert</span> to respond to potential future provocations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Until a prolonged period of calm returns, the risk of another deadly clash between North Korea and South Korea remains real. </span><u>Further naval incidents along the disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the Yellow Sea are certainly conceivable and arguably more likely now that South Korea has modified its rules of engagemen</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">t to permit more rapid response to North Korean incursions. Stepped-up intelligence gathering operations along the periphery of North Korea might also be viewed as intolerably intrusive and elicit a military response, as has happened in the past. Similarly, the interdiction of suspected illicit North Korean goods and materials under the UN sanctions regime might spark another military clash. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Second, North Korea may engage in</span> a renewed campaign of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">provocative behavior for domestic reasons</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The sharp contraction of economic assistance</span> from South Korea <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and</span> other <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">sanctions</span> imposed by the international community <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have caused considerable pain</span> to North Korea, pushing it into a deeper—and arguably unhealthy—dependence on Chinese support</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As it did with previous nuclear and missile testing, the North may see carefully calibrated provocations against South Ko2 rea, Japan, and by extension the United States, as its only recourse to lessen the diplomatic and economic pressure that has been brought to bear on it. Renewed missile testing and further improvements by North Korea to its nuclear weapons capability—such as increased production of fissile material, weaponization of devices, and operational deployments––would be the more obvious ways for it to intimidate the principal players into making concessions. </span><u>Alternatively, various kinds of “external action” may be carried out to support the leadership succession process that is underway in Pyongyang</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Kim Jong-Il’s third son—Kim Jong-Un—has emerged as the heir apparent, judging by his “coming out” at the Korean Workers Party conference in September 2010. He is young and inexperienced, however, and </span><u>many observers believe that his <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">leadership credentials will need to be burnished to strengthen his legitimacy</span> as future ruler of North Korea, especially among the senior ranks of the military</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on whom he will rely for support. Some have speculated that the sinking of the Cheonan was authorized for this very purpose; there have even been reports that Kim Jong-Un personally ordered the attack. Just as his father planned and authorized a series of major provocations in the 1970s while waiting in the wings to assume full power, Kim Jong-Un may do the same. Such incidents might include, for example, more covert submarine attacks; the seizure of an uninhabited but contested island in the Yellow Sea; special forces infiltrations designed to embarrass the Lee Myung-bak administration at critical moments and rattle investor confidence in South Korea; and interference with the operation of the joint Kaesong industrial park. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Third, the succession process may not proceed as planned.</span> Kim Jong-Il could pass from the scene before the designated leadership arrangements have been consolidated.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In such circumstances it is not hard to imagine how the new leadership—whether it is Kim Jong-Un in sole charge or as part of a regency arrangement––could be challenged by others in the regime, either out of personal ambition or because of policy differences. Such disagreements might be triggered or exacerbated by other factors, such as an acutely deteriorating economic situation that precipitates an internal competition for scarce economic resources, or a major humanitarian crisis that provokes internal criticism of the new leader’s stewardship. </span><u>Political instability of this kind could manifest itself in several unwelcome ways for North Korea’s neighbors. For example, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the leadership could stage military provocations to fan an external threat and distract the elites</span> in Pyongyang while also providing the pretext to purge elements threatening to the regime</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Kim Il-Sung, the founding father of North Korea, did just that by exploiting a campaign of external provocation in the late 1960s to consolidate his leadership at a particularly contentious time. An internal power struggle could also lead to external appeals for assistance by particular factions, border incidents involving high-level defections, rogue military operations designed to foment a counterresponse against the regime, mass killings, and ultimately widespread civil strife. Depending on either the amount of spillover or level of life-threatening internal unrest, South Korea, the United States, and China would all come under considerable pressure from various domestic constituencies as well as international organizations to intervene and restore order. Should the North Korean regime begin to lose control over the rest of the country, this imperative would likely prove irresistible especially for South Korean leaders, who would likely see it as a historic but possibly fleeting opportunity to reunify the peninsula. The risk of serious military escalation varies for each of these three scenarios, with the first having the lowest and the third the highest. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Although everyone</span> concerned <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">wants to prevent</span> a major outbreak of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">hostilities—South Korea fears losing</span> its hard-won p<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">rosperity and</span> a much weaker <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">North knows that another war would</span> almost certainly <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">result in its demise</span>—<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the potential for miscalculation, misunderstanding, and unintended escalation cannot be dismissed</span>. Indeed, a combination of factors could propel a crisis beyond what the principal protagonists might initially expect or desire.</u><br />

<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The Korean Peninsula </span>remains one of the most dangerous hotspots in the Asia Pacific. With the emergence of a new and unknown North Korean leader</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - and if wise heads do not prevail in either Seoul or Pyongyang - </span><u>the region <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">may be on the brink of renewed hostilities</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>ONCE AGAIN, the threat of instability leading to a resumption of armed hostilities in the Korean Peninsula is upon the region, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">with the latest artillery bombardment</span> by North Korea of the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The South Korean military has responded with its own artillery bombardment of the North Korean positions. This latest development is merely another in a long history of similar crises, often seemingly unprovoked. </span><u>It</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nevertheless </span><u>threatens to undermine the strategic stability of the Korean Peninsula</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The concept of strategic stability is simple enough: it refers to a condition where strategies that states use to ensure their security remain unchanged, that these strategies remain stable. The critical question that analysts of international security ask is when does strategic stability between two states come under threat? Strategic stability depends upon three elements that together shape the particular inter-state relationship: strategic culture, geography, and military balances. Strategic culture shapes how opposing sets of policymakers view one another, whether or not they view each other with any hostility and suspicion. Geography and the military balance shape the sense of security that either side of this relationship feels at any given time. Natural defences – mountain ranges, wide rivers or open seas – tend to confer a sense of security. However this sense of naturally conferred security can be overcome if, say, the other side acquired military capabilities – say, long-range ballistic missiles – that nullified these natural defences. Latent Instability in the Korean Peninsula </span><u>The Korean War Armistice has lasted longer than some peace treaties have, and as such <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it is tempting to consider the peninsula as intrinsically stable. However, this stability may be more apparent than real</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Culturally, the Korean Peninsula is more or less homogenous. However, this shared culture did not prevent the outbreak of the Korean War. The fact that the Armistice has held longer than some peace treaties deflects attention away from many crises that have erupted since the 1950s, brought about by actions perpetrated by the North: several attempts to assassinate various South Korean presidents; occasional skirmishes across the DMZ; hijacking and bombings of Korean Airlines aircraft; more recently, the sinking of the Cheonan. </span><u>The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">geography </span>of the Korean peninsula <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">definitely does not encourage </span>a sense of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">stability</span>, at least for South Korea, whose political and economic centre of gravity Seoul comes within range of North Korean artillery.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Perhaps the only geographic condition that facilitates strategic stability is the awareness that the physical geography – the central mountain range that runs down the spine of the peninsula in particular – does not facilitate quick and decisive military operations. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The military balance provides grounds for</span> further <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">discomfort</span>, because although South Korea is unequivocally stronger than <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">North Korea</span>, the latter <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has</span> long <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">been suspected of having</span> acquired nuclear weapons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As it stands, it is likely that the North has always maintained a powerful chemical and biological weapons capability. </span><u>Given</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its moribund economy and </span><u>the South’s conventional superiority, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nuclear, biological and chemical weapons</span> are an attractive and apparently cheap strategic option for the North</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “</span><u>It only takes a spark”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “It only takes a spark” </span><u>The fact,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> however, </span><u>that the Armistice has held therefore requires explanation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The absence of strategic stability manifests itself in the sudden change of security strategies towards violence. As the history of the Korean Armistice demonstrates, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the absence of sudden</span> strategic shifts <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">does not necessarily preclude the absence of these elements of strategic stability</span>. The three elements are analogous to the same elements needed for a fire – fuel, tinder and oxygen. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">What is needed to turn these elements into fire is a spark. </span>This intervention comes in the form of politics – both the politics within both Koreas, and the inter-state political relationship.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is important that domestic politics in both states is stable, that neither set of policy elites is under domestic challenge. Where at least one set of policy elites is under domestic challenge, however, this is where this set of policy elites may be tempted to create an external distraction away from their domestic woes. Where both sets of policy elites are under domestic challenge, however, this is where the dangers of miscalculation leading to uncontrollable dynamics rise significantly. What kept the strategic stability of the Korean peninsula since the Armistice was that neither set of policy elites across the DMZ were under significant domestic challenge. Syngman Rhee and later Park Chung Hee were both not very popular, but maintained control in Seoul through strong-arm tactics that stifled domestic challenges. Since the 1980s, successful democratisation has allowed such domestic dissatisfaction to be channelled through the ballot box. Kim Jong Un: The X-factor </span><u>It is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">North Korean domestic politics</span> that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">threatens to unravel</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Kim Il Sung had a vice-like grip over North Korea. His son, Kim Jong Il had a fairly long apprenticeship, and he seems to have managed to maintain a strong grip over the ruling party and the North Korean military. However, his appointed successor, Kim Jong Un, is an unknown element, even within North Korean political and military circles. It will almost certainly take some time for Kim Jong Un to establish his control over the rest of the North Korean policy and military establishments. </span><u>Under such conditions, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">sparks from otherwise minor incidents</span> can assume a significance far beyond the actual event.

Fortunately, as the aphorism goes, it takes two hands to clap. To prevent war, it takes two sets of wise heads. We can be fairly certain these wise heads exist in Seoul; it remains to be seen if wise heads will prevail in Pyongyang as well.</span><br />

<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">With North Korea shelling a</span> South Korean <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">island</span>, and Seoul responding in kind, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">fears of a second Korean War are wafting through Washington</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Thankfully, </span><u>even Pyongyang doesn’t want to revive that conflict, but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the possibility of mistake and accident remain</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Naturally, the United States reiterated its usual security guarantees. The White House said America was “firmly committed” to the South’s defense. But </span><u>why is Washington mixed up in potential hostilities on the Korean Peninsula</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? The U.S. commitment grew out of World War II. Washington divided occupation duties on the peninsula, a colony of defeated Japan, with the Soviet Union. Two separate countries emerged, followed by a three-year conflict, in which America intervened. In 1953 the warring sides agreed to an armistice. The United States gave South Korea a defense treaty and military garrison to keep the peace. Since then the world has changed. The Republic of Korea has rushed past its northern antagonist economically. With the thirteenth-largest economy in the world, the ROK now has about forty times the GDP of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. South Korea also has twice the DPRK’s population, as well as a vast technological edge. Moreover, Seoul has detached North Korea’s traditional allies. The Soviet Union went AWOL under Mikhail Gorbachev. Although Vladimir Putin’s Moscow has somewhat repaired its relationship with Pyongyang, Russia still has a far more important economic relationship with the ROK. So does China, which trades fifty times as much with the South as with the North. Only in military strength does the DPRK retain a numerical edge over Seoul. North Korea has 1.1 million men under arms, an impressive number, but individual conscripts tend to be malnourished and of uncertain quality. Their weapons are antiquated. A prime fighting force the North Korean military is not. The South only has about seven hundred thousand men under arms, but they are better trained and deploy better weapons. In any case, Seoul has the resources to provide whatever it believes necessary for its own defense. There is no special gravitational field on the peninsula that keeps the ROK military numerically inferior. South Korea simply prefers to spend its money on economic development. It was one thing for the United States to subsidize the South’s defense when that nation was vulnerable to an attack by the DPRK backed by China and the Soviet Union. That’s no longer the case. </span><u>America’s military commitment also didn’t seem to matter much when no one imagined another war was really possible.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> When the North’s “Dear Leader” Kim Jong Il was holding summits with South Korea’s presidents, conflict seemed far away. </span><u>But last March the DPRK apparently sank a South Korean warship.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Seoul did little, other than demand an apology—a demand which the government of President Lee Myung-bak recently retracted. </span><u>Now the North has staged another violent incident. Even though <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Pyongyang</span> almost certainly does not want war, its <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">provocative behavior risks triggering</span> one, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a conflict in which the U.S. would immediately become involved</span>. In fact, there have been proposals for retaliation against the North backed by Washington. Such a step could start a war directly. There’s no justification for keeping the United States in between the two Koreas. It is long past time for Seoul to develop whatever size military it believes to be necessary</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and whatever policy towards the North it believes to be appropriate—and to accept the consequences accordingly. The ROK is strong enough to do what important countries traditionally have done throughout history, defend itself. Washington’s one area of genuine interest, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nonproliferation, is not advanced by a troop presence in the South. In fact, those are the only Americans within the North’s reach.</span> They are, in effect, nuclear hostages</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if Pyongyang develops nuclear weapons and delivery systems. </span><u>The latest intra-Korean skirmish should serve as that proverbial fire bell in the night. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Alliances can</span> deter. They also can <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">entangle</span>. In the case of South Korea <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the security relationship risks drawing the United States into wa</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">r</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with no countervailing benefits for Americans. After all, the ROK no longer is central to a larger international struggle, as it was during the Cold War. And </span><u>the South is capable of deterring the DPRK and winning any conflict that might erupt.</u><br />

<strong>South Korea will inevitably initiate conflict – our military presence emboldens them and ensures escalation</strong><br />
<strong>Carpenter, Nov 29, 2010 – senior Fellow, the Cato Institute</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11262:http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics" rel="nofollow">http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11262 --> Does Washington Need to Fear South Korea More than North Korea? Ted Galen Carpenter</span><br />
<u>Since <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">North Korea’s artillery barrage</span> targeting a South Korean island last week, concerns have mounted that the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">incident could escalate into a full-blown military crisis</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on the Peninsula. </span><u>The scenario that most experts fear is that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">North Korea, facing an uncertain leadership succession</span> as dictator Kim Jong-il grows increasingly frail, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">may</span> be <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">choos</span>ing a <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">saber-rattling</span> strategy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to gain both attention and concessions from the international community. That thesis was also prominent following the sinking of the South Korean naval vessel Cheonan last spring. </span><u>Such a strategy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the reasoning goes, although intended to be mere posturing, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could lead to miscalculation</span> and tragedy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. U.S. officials understandably focus on the dangers that could arise from North Korea’s actions. </span><u>But there is a less obvious risk that merits more attention than it has received: that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">South Korea</span> has had enough of its neighbor’s aggression and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">may</span> decide to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">respond in a manner that triggers a crisis</span>. Events over the past week suggest that South Korea’s military and political leadership might be going down that path.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">One has come to expect the North Korean propaganda apparatus to spout apocalyptic warnings on a regular basis. Korea watchers have probably lost count of the number of times Pyongyang has threatened to turn Seoul into “a sea of fire” over the years. And predictably, following the latest incident, North Korean media warned that the region teetered on the brink of war, and that both South Korean and U.S. forces would experience dire punishment if such a conflict erupted. There was nothing new in any of this. </span><u>What is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> new—and </span><u>more than a little ominous—is the tone coming out of South Korea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">President Lee</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Myung-bak </span><u>thundered that there would be “enormous retaliation”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> should the North launch another attack like the shelling incident. Presumably, he has something more substantial in mind than the limited economic sanctions that his government imposed following the sinking of the Cheonan. Speaking at the funeral of two South Korean marines killed in the shelling, the commander of those forces vowed “a thousand-fold revenge” for their deaths. Other prominent figures have adopted a similar strident rhetoric. Of course, this all may be little more than patriotic bluster for domestic consumption. </span><u>But having staked-out a strong position against Pyongyang’s latest outrage, political and military leaders <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">risk looking weak</span>—indeed, buffoonish—<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">if the</span> actual <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">response is just</span> more ineffectual <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">symbolism.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Equally important, the South Korean public seems to be more supportive of serious retaliatory measures than in the past. During previous crises, many South Koreans worried that Washington’s response to a Pyongyang provocation might plunge the Peninsula into war against the wishes of the South Korean people and government. They had reasons for such fears. In the months leading up to the 1994 Agreed Framework freezing Pyongyang’s plutonium program, the Clinton administration seriously considered air strikes against North Korean targets. South Koreans also remember how Senator John McCain advocated a similar strategy in 2003, and was openly dismissive of possible South Korean objections. Seoul would not have had a veto over U.S. actions in either case, despite the obvious negative consequences. But now the opposite risk has emerged—<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">that </span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">South Korea could drag the United States into an unwanted war</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Washington is counseling restraint, and the Obama administration has publicly praised the South Korean government for its patience and prudence to this point. It is more likely than not that U.S. pressure will prevail and cause tempers in Seoul to cool. Yet even if that happens in this case, </span><u>U.S. policymakers</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the American people </span><u>should soberly assess the grave risks that our country is incurring by maintaining the defense alliance with South Korea and, even more so, by keeping a tripwire military force on the Peninsula.</u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">If Pyongyang continues to</span> prod and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">provoke</span> its neighbor, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">at some point South Korean leaders will likely conclude that they must respond militarily</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Like the mild- mannered student who is continuously harassed by the playground bully, </span><u>there often comes a breaking point and that victim takes a stand</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In some cases, the bully then backs down and the overall situation improves significantly. But in other cases, a major fight erupts with highly unpredictable results. </span><u>If that happens on the Korean Peninsula, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Americans will rue</span> the day that their leaders foolishly <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">maintained a military presence</span> in such a dangerous neighborhood</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<u>Is it North or <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">South Korean brinkmanship that is risking a new Korean War</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? POHANG, SOUTH KOREA. &quot;Just let me know if I have to worry,&quot; read my mother's email. With her son living in South Korea for close to fifteen years, we have been through this several times. Whenever North Korea is in the news, she naturally worries about my safety, and now that I've given her a lovely daughter-in-law and two beautiful children, her worries have quadrupled. Since I've been here, there have been raids by commandoes, missile launches, alleged nuclear tests, threats of a &quot;Sea of fire,&quot; two sea battles, claiming six and forty-six South Korean sailors respectively, and, most recently the first artillery exchange since the 1953 armistice that lulled the Korean War, in which four South Koreans, including, most disturbingly, two civilians, were killed. When I first got here, I, too was, spooked whenever North Korea was in the news, but I soon did what any resdient of a foreign country should do; I learned from the locals. I saw that South Koreans didn't care. They ignored the news coming from the North. They acted like the sibling of someone with Tourette's Syndrone or severe Autism; while the behavior looked scary to outsiders, they were used to it. Those of us who've been &quot;in country&quot; a few years like to laugh at the &quot;rookies&quot; who get all jittery and start packing their bags whenever CNN finds it necessary to show scary pictures of menacing North Korean soldiers at PanmunjÅm. So I wrote back to my mother, &quot;You don't have to worry, Mom.&quot; I lied. </span><u>This time is different. This year, South Koreans are talking about it.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The naval battle on the eve of the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup was ignored. (A traffic accident invovling the US military at the same time, in which two middle school girls tragically died, was not ignored; there were anti-American demonstrations that brought hundreds of thousands to the streets, unreported by most mainstream media in America.) </span><u>The sinking of the Cheonan earlier this year was not ignored</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, perhaps because the loss of life was so great. The 46 sailors were properly mourned, and, along with the anger directed northward, there seemed to be even more conspiracy analysis in the South regarding their government's version of the story. </span><u>Things are really different with last month's shelling of the disputed Yeonpyeong Island</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, perhaps because of the loss of civilian life and property. My students and colleagues are talking about this event, bringing it up freely, voicing their concerns and fears. I, too, am a bit nervous, but I'm less nervous about what P'yÅngyang (and Beijing) might intentionally do than what Seoul (and Washington) might accidentally do. A day after the November 23rd </span><u>Yeonpyeong</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> attack, Justin Raimondo rightly noted that </span><u>&quot;the South Koreans were conducting military 'exercises' near the disputed island</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which North Korea claims as its territory, and South Korean ships had opened fire,&quot; going on to suggest that &quot;the military exercises, code-named 'Hoguk,' involving all four branches of the South Korean armed forces and some 70,000 troops, simulated an attack on North Korea, and were meant to provoke the North Koreans, who responded as might be expected&quot; [Korean Conundrum: Is There a Way Out?]. He continued, &quot;US troops were supposed to have participated in the exercises, but apparently the Americans thought better of it and pulled back at the last moment -- perhaps because they knew a provocation was in the making&quot; [ibid]. Mr. Raimondo went on to argue, even more pointedly, &quot;For the South Koreans to conduct military exercises in this explosive region, never mind firing off rounds, is nothing but a naked provocation of the sort the West routinely ascribes to Pyongyang. In the context of North Korea's recent revelation that it is increasing its nuclear capacity, the South Korean military maneuvers were meant to elicit a violent response and succeeded in doing so&quot; [ibid]. A few days later, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said of the incident, &quot;Launching a military attack on civilians is a crime against humanity, even during wartime&quot; [South Korean president takes responsibility for failing to protect country, signals hardened military stance toward North]. Of course, he is about right attacks on civilians being crimes against humanity, but he said nothing of the irresponsibility of holding war games so close to an inhabited and disputed island. Speaking of President Lee, analyst Peter Lee has argued that &quot;significant North Asian takeaways from the WikiLeaks cables&quot; clearly show that &quot;South Korea, under President Lee Myung-bak, wants the North to collapse and to dominate the reunification process&quot; (while &quot;North Korea is desperate to establish relations with the United States&quot;) and that &quot;South Korean government officials are indefatigably, crudely and rather transparently 'working the refs' - selectively packaging and vociferously pushing their arguments - to persuade the United States to abandon mediation through the People's Republic of China (PRC) and/or negotiation with North Korea and instead put South Korea and its reunification agenda in the diplomatic driver's seat&quot; [Dear Leader's designs on Uncle Sam]. Since the </span><u>Yeonpyeong</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> attack, there have been joint games with the United States, which sent the U.S.S. George Washington, against Chinese warnings (not to mention the warnings of George Washington against &quot;foreign entanglements&quot;). These were followed by joint war games between the United States and Japan, who has her own territorial dispute with Russia, leading South Korean journalist Yi Yong-in to warn that &quot;a 'three against three' framework with South Korea, the United States and Japan on one side and North Korea, China, and Russia on the other is showing signs of taking shape once again&quot; and to speak of a &quot;New Cold War&quot; [Cold War alliances reborn with regional tension]. If the danger of a &quot;New Cold War&quot; were not bad enough, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">there is the very real danger of a hot war, with South Korea</span> launching its own live fire war games in dozens of areas around the peninsula and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">warning of responding to any North Korean reaction</span> with air strikes:</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span><u>The extent of possible <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">South Korean air strikes</span> on the North is not clear, but anything other than an extremely limited and localized action <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is likely to trigger total war,&quot; warned Koreanologist Gregory Elich, &quot;a war that the U.S. will inevitably be drawn into</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; [Menacing North Korea]. The last total war on this peninsula resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, hundreds of thousands of Chinese, and millions of Koreas. </span><u>Even a cursory glance at <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">world history shows how a minor incident can escalate to a total war</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Of this possibility, </span><u>fellow Korea resident Andray Abrahamian has reminded us, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">&quot;If</span> through <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">an overly aggressive deterrence posture war breaks out, millions on both sides could die</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [and] the two generations of sweat and tears that drove South Korea's economic growth could be undone,&quot; rightly concluding that &quot;it is absolutely inappropriate for foreign Korea-watchers to call for greater aggression in confronting the North&quot; [Pyongyang stretches deterrence limits].)</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">New York (CNN) -- The Korean War began 60 years ago on June 25, 1950, and it still hasn't ended. Fighting on the Korean Peninsula may have stopped with a cease-fire in July 1953, but North and South Korea have remained in a tense state of armed truce ever since, with open warfare just a hair-trigger away. The sinking of the South Korean navy vessel Cheonan on March 26 -- which an international investigation team concluded last week to be the result of a North Korean torpedo attack -- shows how volatile the situation remains between North and South. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">There is a</span> real <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">danger of the current war of words escalating into a shooting war</span>, which would be a catastrophe for Korea and the surrounding region. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">But if</span> all sides, including <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the United States, pull back from the brink, this</span> tragedy <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">may</span> also <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">present an opportunity to defuse tensions</span> with North Korea <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and resume talks</span> that have been on hold for the last two years.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Cheonan disaster caused an outcry of grief and anger in South Korea. On May 24, South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak gave a forceful speech to his countrymen, asserting that South Korea would not tolerate any provocation from the North and would pursue &quot;proactive deterrence.&quot; South Koreans, Lee vowed, &quot;will immediately exercise our right of self-defense&quot; if their territorial waters, airspace or territory are violated.&quot; Lee called the sinking of the Cheonan, in which 46 sailors died, a violation of the United Nations Charter and of the Korean War Armistice and said he would turn to the U.N. Security Council for international support in condemning North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has demanded North Korea face &quot;consequences&quot; for this attack. But North Korea denies involvement in the incident, claiming the whole investigation is a fabrication designed to undermine North-South Korean relations and ignite a war against the North. The North Koreans have said any retaliation against them for the incident would be met with a forceful and immediate response, up to and including all-out war. China has so far been neutral about the investigation's findings, calling the incident a &quot;tragedy&quot; but refusing to blame North Korea and calling for calm on all sides. Without China's support, no call for action against North Korea will make it through the U.N. Security Council. (China is one of the five nations that hold veto power on the Council.) China supported two rounds of U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang, after North Korea's nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009, but is unlikely to support sanctions this time. North Korea denies responsibility for the incident and China regards the evidence as inconclusive. Besides, </span><u>it's hard to see what further economic or diplomatic pressure can be put on North Korea, which already faces tough previous sanctions.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Contrary to common belief, North Korea is not facing internal political disarray or economic decline. Kim Jong Il appears to be fully in charge, and harvests for the last two years have been relatively good. Chinese sources estimate a substantial increase in North Korean industrial production over the last year. Whatever may have motivated the attack on the Cheonan, it was not the act of a desperate or divided regime, and the strong sanctions called for by President Lee -- even if China would agree to support and enforce them -- are not likely to get North Korea to admit responsibility for the attack or to change its behavior. On the other hand, </span><u>there is a real danger of this war of words escalating into a shooting war.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> With well over a million Korean troops facing each other across the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South, along with 29,000 U.S. troops in the South, and North Korea now armed with nuclear weapons, the consequences of a renewed Korean War would be catastrophic for the Korean peninsula and the entire Northeast Asia region. </span><u>The Cheonan incident has reinforced U.S.-South Korean and U.S.-Japanese cooperation in deterring the North. But <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">deterrence can look like provocation from the other side, and in such a tense</span> and volatile <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">environment, a slight miscalculation can lead to disaster</span>.</strong> Anger and outrage may be understandable, but cooler heads must prevail. Millions of lives are at stake. Rather than lead to deepening confrontation, this tragedy may be an opportunity to re-engage North Korea in talks</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to scale back and ultimately eliminate its nuclear program, and to promote security and economic cooperation with its neighbors. North Korea has never admitted to acts of terrorism in the past, and we cannot expect it to acknowledge responsibility and apologize for the sinking of the Cheonan as a precondition for such talks. Instead, the international community should take advantage of Kim Jong Il's stated willingness to return to multilateral negotiations, suspended since 2008, as a way of reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula. It is time to end the Korean War, not start it anew.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Could the current economic crisis affecting this country and the world lead to another world war? The answer may be found by looking back in history. </span><u>One of the causes of World War I was the economic rivalry that existed between the nations of Europe.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In the 19th century France and Great Britain became wealthy through colonialism and the control of foreign resources. This forced other up-and-coming nations (such as Germany) to be more competitive in world trade which led to rivalries and ultimately, to war. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">After the Great Depression ruined the economies of Europe</span> in the 1930s, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">fascist movements arose to seek</span> economic and social <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">control</span>. From there fanatics like <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Hitler and Mussolini took over</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Germany and Italy and led them both into World War II.</span> <u>With most of North America and Western Europe currently experiencing a recession, will competition for resources and economic rivalries with the Middle East, Asia, or South American cause another world war? <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Add in nuclear weapons and Islamic fundamentalism and things look even worse.</span></strong> Hopefully the economy gets better before it gets worse and the terrifying possibility of World War III is averted.

<strong>Hayes &amp; Hamel-Green, 2010</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – *Executive Director of the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainable Development, AND Executive Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Education and Human Development act Victoria University (1/5/10, Executive Dean at Victoria, “The Path Not Taken, the Way Still Open: Denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/10001HayesHamalGreen.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/10001HayesHamalGreen.pdf</a>) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The international community is increasingly aware that cooperative diplomacy is the most productive way to tackle the multiple, interconnected global challenges facing humanity, not least of which is the increasing proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Korea and Northeast Asia are instances where risks of</span> nuclear proliferation and actual <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nuclear use</span> arguably <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have increased</span> in recent years.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This negative trend is a product of continued US nuclear threat projection against the DPRK as part of a general program of coercive diplomacy in this region, North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, the breakdown in the Chinese-hosted Six Party Talks towards the end of the Bush Administration, regional concerns over China’s increasing military power, and concerns within some quarters in regional states (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) about whether US extended deterrence (“nuclear umbrella”) afforded under bilateral security treaties can be relied upon for protection. </span><u>The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not only for the Northeast Asian region but </span><u>for the whole international community.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> At worst, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">there is the </span></u><strong><u>possibility of nuclear attack</u></strong> 1 , <u>whether <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">by </span></u><strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"><u>intention, miscalculation, or</u></span> <u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> merely <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">accident</span></span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities</span>.</u> On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust</span> of unprecedented proportions.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).</span><u>The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: That is not global winter, but </span><u>the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…</span><u>The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">…To make matters even worse, </span><u>such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4 These, of course, are not the only consequences. </span><u>Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The</span> direct <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">impacts</span>, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could </span></u><strong><u>make the present <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">global financial crisis pale by comparison</span></u></strong><u>.</u> How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">There could be</span> many <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">5, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">with </span></u><strong><u>subsequent nuclear breakout</u></strong> <u>and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and</span> <strong>aftermath <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">chain-reaction affects</span> involving other potential proliferant states.</strong></u> The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community. <br />

<u>North Korea’s artillery attack on a South Korean island on Tuesday was the latest in a series of Pyongyang’s aggressive moves over the past year and a half. They started with ballistic missile tests in April</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of last year, </span><u>soon followed by a nuclear test in May</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Kim Jong Il, who may be mad, </span><u>upped the ante last March with the sinking of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a South Korean corvette, </span><u>the Cheonan</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, with the loss of 46 lives. Given his erratic ways and the hellish nature of his regime, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">America would be well advised to leave</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Korea</span>ns, north and south, to sort out their differences well alone</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Contrary to the flawed and ignorant New York Times “analysis,” </span><u>the artillery attack had nothing to do with North Korea feeling “under stress or threatened”</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">by the international sanctions, or “frustrated” with the U.S. negotiating position on its nuclear enrichment program. If this were true, all that is needed is a signal from the White House that America is ready for another round of talks and the tension will subside. </span><u>Even less was the barrage connected to alleged “recent moves by the ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong-il to position his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, as heir apparent.”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The claim that the Beloved Leader is trying to ensure “that the Kim family dynasty continues for a third generation by winning the loyalty of the powerful military with shows of force” is laughable. The loyalty of North Korea’s officers does not need to be “won,” as any hint that it is anything but total means the death of the suspect. In any event, at the metaphysical level of North Korea’s brand of dialectics the succession debate is superfluous: it is Kim Il Sung—the Great Leader, the Beloved Leader’s father—who is still in charge of the country, having been appointed “Eternal President” by the Supreme People’s Assembly in 1994, four years before his temporal death. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">North Korea is acting aggressively because it is weak. Its economy</span>—a surreal mix of Stalinist central planning and Maoist autarky—<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">cannot feed its</span> twenty-odd million <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">people</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Two million are estimated to have died of starvation over the past decade and a half.) Food and money assistance from the South have stopped coming. Kim wants the flow resumed, and he is being obnoxious in the hope of getting a bribe to be tolerable once again. If offered a peace treaty that’s to his liking, he may even become nice. If he gets nothing, he’ll do something even uglier in a few weeks or months. It is a crude ploy, but he is a crude man. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The only reason Kim</span>’s histrionics <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">matter</span> to the United States <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the existence of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the</span> anachronistic and unnecessary <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">presence of American troops in South Korea. The best way to deal with the problem is for the United States to withdraw all its troops from the Korean peninsula</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and le</span>t those most affected by Pyongyang’s behavior—<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">South Korea</span>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Japan, China</span>, and Russia—<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">deal with Kim</span> as they deem fit</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The U.S. withdrawal from the Korean peninsula should be accompanied by a quiet nod to Seoul to go ahead and develop its own nuclear deterrent. Back in the 1970s the Ford Administration induced South Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program in return for not withdrawing American soldiers. Now is the time to reverse the sequence: Washington should grant a free nuclear hand to Seoul in return for the U.S. withdrawal. South Korea has a strong civilian nuclear program with many dual-use activities in place, a physical infrastructure and a technical capability that may result in a credible deterrent within a year or two. As I noted in this column over two years ago, removing the American umbrella from South Korea would be beneficial to both sides because </span><u>the U.S. would be disengaged from a spot where <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the dangers of continued military presence exceed benefits</span>, while <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">South Korea would be forced to end its dependence on Washington for its defense</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">: </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">American withdrawal would prompt South Korea finally to become a</span> mature, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">self-reliant regional power</span> fully responsible for its self-protection, as befits one of the most highly developed industrial economies in the world</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>It would also force it to diversify its portfolio of foreign contacts, possibly leading to a Russian-South Korean or a Chinese-South Korean alliance, either of which is preferable to an open-ended American guarantee</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Some South Koreans are bound to start dragging their feet while simultaneously clamoring for continued U.S. security guarantee. It would not be the first time, but they should be told that </span><u>America has no national interest in <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">retaining troops in Korea</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or in continuing to protect Seoul. Old habits may die hard, but </span><u>the 55-year habit of garrisoning South Korea has to be kicked because it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is dangerous, expensive, and unnecessary.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> To the argument that South Korea’s military is not strong enough to withstand the threat from the North, the answer is clear: </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">only by removing our tripwire can</span> America finally <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">force South Korea to upgrade its military</span> and to make its people assume the full economic and political burden of defending their own country.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For exactly the same reason American troops should be removed from Japan and Germany. A strategic anachronism five decades old would thus be finally ended. The above conclusions from October 2008 still stand, word for word.</span><br />

The US, however, put the kibosh on that hopeful scenario. That didn’t stop the South Koreans, however: over US opposition, Dae-jung’s heir pursued the sunshine policy with even more vigor, traveling to North Korea and stepping over the physical border – but it was not to be.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">What I do know is that U.S. was drawn into the Korean Peninsula during the Cold War and as part of an effort to contain the threat of Communist military aggression -- in the form of Communist China -- in Northeast Asia. Despite the fact that the Cold War ended a while ago (that I also know) </span><u>U.S. military commitment</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><u>was formalized through a security agreement with South Korea and is demonstrated by <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the continuing presence of 37,000 U.S. troops in that country is still in place</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The main threat that is being raised as a way of justifying this U.S. military commitment and presence is that of North Korea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In particular, Pyongyang's drive to develop nuclear military capability has become the main rationale for U.S. military intervention in the Korean Peninsula. </span><u>Ironically, one of the reasons that North Korea has taken the nuclear military direction has to do with legitimate concerns -- considering U.S. policies in Iraq and elsewhere -- over a possible U.S. attempt to do a &quot;regime change&quot; in Pyongyang.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In any case, the main threat that North Korea is posing today is to its neighbors in northeast Asia. There is the long-term concern over the economic problems, including the flow of refugees into South Korea and China that could follow the collapse of North Korean. And there is no reason why Japan and South Korea should not be worried over the rise of a nuclear North Korea. Indeed, these worst-case-scenarios reflect what should be seen as direct threat to the core national interests of South Korea, Japan -- and China -- and not to that of the U.S. It is not difficult to imagine the U.S. response if the central government in Mexico disintegrates and/or if Chavez's Venezuela goes nuclear. But </span><u>Korea is not in America's strategic backyard but in China's. A <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Chin</span>a that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is trying to project itself as a responsible regional power in East Asia</span> should be <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">concerned that Japan and South Korea would</span> have no other choice but to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">develop their nuclear</span> military <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">capability</span> --</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> an idea that has been opposed by Washington -- </span><u>in order <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to deter</span> a nuclear <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">North Korea</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ruled by the Kim Dynasty. So in a way, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the most effective way for the U.S. to help achieve a stable</span> balance of power in the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Korea</span>n Peninsula <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">not by sending more war ships to South Korea but </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">by providing incentives to the Chinese</span> to stop making excuses for the North Koreans</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- not to mention honoring Dear Leader during his visit to Beijing -- and to start &quot;doing something&quot; about North Korea. Washington could help by working with Seoul and Tokyo -- and Beijing -- in drawing an outline for a timeline for a nuclear military disarmament of North Korea as part of a package deal involving economic assistance to the North as well as process of diplomatic détente with that government, including ties with Washington (and perhaps eventually the peaceful reunification of the peninsula). There is no doubt that it is China, as Pyongyang's only regional (and global) patron, that would have to play the main role in forcing North Korea to accept such a deal. </span><u>The alternative should not be an all-out war in the Korean Peninsula involving U.S. troops, but an American &quot;green light&quot; to Seoul and Tokyo to take all the necessary steps to protect their security</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- including the nuclear military option. And while I don't know many things, </span><u>I am quite sure that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the prospect of Japan and South Korea going nuclear will make it more likely</span> than not that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">China will finally start acting</span> like the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">responsible regional power</span> that it claims to be.</u><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">C</span><u>hina yesterday called for emergency direct diplomacy with North Korea in order to lower escalating tensions following last week's artillery attack on South Korea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (see GSN, Nov. 24). </span><u>However, the United States and its allies said now is not the time to address Pyongyang's demands for new six-party talks.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">North Korea's shelling of the inhabited South Korean island of Yeonpyeong resulted in the deaths of several soldiers and civilians and injuries to nearly 20 more. The incident directly followed news from Washington that Pyongyang revealed to visiting U.S. experts earlier this month that it had covertly built a large-scale advanced uranium enrichment facility at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, the Wall Street Journal reported. The two events have renewed international attention on the North Korean nuclear impasse. Beijing dispatched its senior foreign affairs official to lead a delegation to Seoul over the weekend for talks on the crisis. However, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak told the Chinese visitors that it was not the &quot;right time&quot; to relaunch long-stalled six-nation talks aimed at the permament denuclearization of North Korea, according to an administration official. The nuclear talks involve China, Japan, the two Koreas, Russia and the United States. They were last held almost two years ago. Pyongyang withdrew from the negotiations in April 2009 and one month later carried out its second nuclear weapons test, an action for which it was punished with heightened U.N. Security Council sanctions. The North for some time has declared its willingness to return to the nuclear talks. However, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo are leery of returning to a negotiating framework that has been used by the North in the past as a means to win international concessions only to later resume work on its nuclear weapons program. The three allies have called on Pyongyang to demonstrate its &quot;sincere&quot; commitment to nuclear disarmament before they will agree to resume negotiations. China is North Korea's strongest foreign ally and chief economic benefactor. </span><u>Beijing's continued support of the Kim Jong Il regime is frequently cited in Washington as the only thing keeping the Stalinist government from collapsing. Because of this, China has come under growing criticism from the international community to do more to press North Korea over its belligerent behavior</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;It's hard to know why China doesn't push harder,&quot; Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a CNN interview aired yesterday. &quot;They clearly are interested in this -- in the region not spinning out of control -- so my sense is they try to control this guy, and I'm not sure he is controllable.&quot; Lee yesterday told Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo in blunt remarks that China must take a &quot;more fair and responsible position&quot; on peninsula affairs and leave Cold War-era considerations behind, according to presidential spokesman Hong Sang-pyo. In a television address today, Lee pledged North Korea &quot;would pay a price&quot; for any future hostilities and said that &quot;more endurance and forgiveness would only result in bigger provocations&quot; (Fairclough/Ramstad, Wall Street Journal I, Nov. 28). Japan today dismissed Beijing's call for direct talks with North Korea. Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said it would be &quot;unacceptable for us to hold six-party talks only because North Korea has gone amok,&quot; the Wall Street Journal reported (Yuka Hayashi, Wall Street Journal II, Nov. 29). The United States has yet to give a response to China's call for emergency talks, saying it would carry out discussions with the South Korean government first, Reuters reported. A high-ranking Pyongyang official voiced doubts about Beijing's initiative to engage in discussions. While the North has not responded to China's call, the unidentified official told Kyodo News that countries involved in the latest incident should meet for talks first (Laurence/Choonsik, Reuters, Nov. 29). </span><u>While urging that the two Koreas to refrain from actions that would raise tensions on the peninsula, China has abstained from condemning Pyongyang's shelling of the South Korean island, indicating that Beijing will refuse</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the urging of Washington and other states </span><u>to punish the North</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the Los Angeles Times reported last Thursday. North Korea's presumed possession of the nuclear bomb, its large arsenal of chemical weapons and a massive standing army make a military assault on the isolated state an unattractive option, according to reports. The United States and much of the international community have already drastically curtailed trade relations with the Stalinist state. In the White House view, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">China remains the only nation to have sway over the North and the only hope of producing a change in the Korean nuclear impasse. &quot;China is pivotal to moving North Korea in a fundamentally different direction,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;You can go [to] the U.N. Security Council or call for a five-party meeting (minus North Korea). But first you've got to go after China,&quot; said Victor Cha, point man for North Korean policy during the Bush administration.</span><br />

The bulls have chosen to focus on this conflict as yet another example of “saber rattling” from North Korea, but </span><u>its consequence could be far greater than ever before, considering a few key factors.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> FIRST, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">China has the greatest influence over North Korea</span> and how they handle them will substantially affect the world economy.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> SECOND, China is the largest foreign holder of US Government debt in the history of our nation, with holdings of nearly 900 billion dollars. This position gives them significant leverage over the US and substantially undermines our ability to negotiate with them when they side against us, as they seem to be doing now. THIRD, China has systematically devalued the juan in response to QE2 creating the dawn of inflation as we are beginning to see now and will soon see in the US. The recent interest rate increase in China has yet to show signs of curbing inflation. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">If the US and China are unable to come to terms with the conflict in the Korean Peninsula, it is unlikely they will come to terms with stabilizing their currencies</span> — continuing on a path of systematically devaluing currencies and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">creating a future threat of inflation while undermining a worldwide economic recovery</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, an insane dictator with nuclear weapons that is not kept at bay, by its closest ally and neighbor, is always a threat to the economy and well being of nations throughout the world. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">China has a responsibility to help stabilize the region and until they do, uncertainty and fear will remain throughout the worldwide financial markets,</span> keeping us in a very defensive position.</u><br />

<strong>Chinese Currency Conflicts cause a slippery slope to protectionism and trade war</strong><br />
<strong>The Globe and Mail September 30, 2010</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [Congress flexes muscle over China's yuan; U.S. politicians set stage to allow companies to seek retribution for lost sales due to underpriced imports BYLINE: KEVIN CARMICHAEL Staff Lexis</span><br />
<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">U.S. lawmakers are taking direct aim at China's economic policies,</span> endorsing legislation that would allow companies to seek retribution for lost sales <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">due to undervalued currencies</span> such as the yuan.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The House of Representatives voted 348-79 Wednesday to amend the 1930 Tariff Act to make clear that &quot;fundamental exchange-rate misalignment&quot; is a punishable subsidy under American trade law. The change, if enacted, would require the U.S. Trade Representative to consider complaints of harm due to foreign currency policies, opening the door to countervailing import duties. China isn't mentioned in the bill, but the target of the measure's authors is clear. As lawmakers considered the legislation at committee last week, the debate was all about China, which politicians, unions and some companies have long accused of benefiting from the active management of its exchange rate at the expense of lost American jobs. Estimates suggest the yuan is undervalued relative to the dollar by anywhere from 5 to 40 per cent. </span><u>With midterm elections little more than a month away,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the country's unemployment rate stuck above 9.5 per cent two years after the financial crisis, </span><u>some political show of force against China was all but inevitable</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;We want China to know that we're all standing shoulder-to-shoulder for fair trade,&quot; Pennsylvania Republican Tim Murphy, the bill's co-sponsor, told Bloomberg Television before the vote. The China measure has a long way to go before becoming law. The Senate and the president also would have to approve it, and it's unclear whether either would do so. Still, </span><u>the vote represents a shift in the politics that surround China's economic policies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For all the vitriol spilled on China's currency practices in recent years, </span><u>the House until Wednesday had stopped short of endorsing a legislative remedy directed at Beijing's policy of keeping the yuan pegged at an advantageous rate against the dollar</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Politicians may well be bluffing - many said during the debate that their goal is to give Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner a &quot;stick&quot; to help in negotiations with the Chinese. But </span><u>the fact <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">that there now is legislation on the table necessarily increases the risk of a trade war between the world's two largest economies. It also threatens to set a precedent for other countries that have issues with the currency policies</span> of China and other countries.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;It is important to keep the pressure on China to re-align its currency, but if countries start trying to countervail on the basis of exchange rates, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we could be on a pretty slippery and dangerous slope in terms of respect for the integrity of WTO rules</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; said Lawrence Herman, a trade lawyer at Cassels Brock in Toronto.</span><br />
<strong>Trade wars cause global war</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The choice facing the West today is much the same as that which faced the Soviet bloc after World War II: between meeting head-on the challenge of world trade with the adjustments and the benefits that it will bring, or of attempting to shut out markets that are growing and where a dynamic new pace is being set for innovative production. The problem about the second approach is not simply that it won’t hold: satellite technology alone will ensure that consumers will begin to demand those goods that the East is able to provide most cheaply. More fundamentally, it will guarantee the emergence of a fragmented world in which natural fears will be fanned and inflamed. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A world divided into</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">rigid</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">trade blocs will be a deeply troubled and unstable place</span> in <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">which</span> suspicion and ultimately envy <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will possibly erupt into a major war</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I do not say that the converse will necessarily be true, that in a free trading world there will be an absence of all strife. Such a proposition would manifestly be absurd. But </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">t</span></u><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">o trade is to become interdependent, and that is a good stop in the direction of world stability.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This report examines North Korea’s chemical and biological weapons capabilities in the context of its military doctrine and national objectives. It is based on open source literature, interviews and unpublished documents made available to Crisis Group. Companion reports published simultaneously assess the DPRK’s nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities and what the policy response of the international community should be to its recent nuclear and missile testing.[1] North Korea’s programs to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missiles pose serious risks to security. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Pyongyang’s</span> nuclear capabilities are the greatest threat, but it also <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">possesses a </span></u><strong><u>large stockpile of chemical weapons</u></strong> <u>and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">is suspected of maintaining a biological weapons program</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span></u> The Six-Party Talks (China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the U.S.) had been underway since August 2003 with the objective of ending the North’s nuclear ambitions, before Pyongyang announced its withdrawal in April 2009, but <u>there is no direct mechanism for dealing with its chemical weapons and possible biological weapons. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The North Korean leadership is very unlikely to surrender its WMD </span></u><strong><u>unless there is significant change in the political and security environments .</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Six-Party Talks pro­duced a “Statement of Principles” in September 2005 that included a commitment to establish a permanent peace mechanism in North East Asia, but the structure and nature of such a cooperative security arrangement is subject to interpretation, negotiation and implementation. Views among the parties differ, and no permanent peace can be established unless North Korea abandons all its WMD programs. The diplomatic tasks are daunting, and diplomacy could fail. If North Korea refuses to engage in arms control and to rid itself of WMD, the international community must be prepared to deal with a wide range of threats, including those posed by Pyongyang’s chemical and biological weapons capabilities. </span><u>Unclassified estimates of the chemical weapons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (CW) </span><u>arsenal are imprecise, but</u> <strong><u>the consensus</u></strong> <u>is that the</u> Korean People’s Army <u>(KPA) possesses 2,500-5,000 tons,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> including mustard, phosgene, blood agents, sarin, tabun and V-agents (persistent nerve agents<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">). </span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The stockpile</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> does not appear to be increasing but </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">is </span></u><strong><u>already sufficient</u></strong> <u>to inflict massive civilian casualties on South Korea.</u> The North’s CW can be delivered with long-range artillery, multiple rocket launchers, FROGs (free rocket over ground), ballistic missiles, aircraft and naval vessels. North Korean military doctrine emphasises quick offensive strikes to break through enemy defences in order to achieve national military objectives before the U.S. can intervene effectively on behalf of its South Korean ally. However, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the North’s conventional military capabilities are declining</span> against those of its potential foes, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">so the leadership is likely to rely on asymmetric capabilities</span> for its national security objectives. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">This</span> strategy poses a significant danger because it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">risks </span></u><strong><u>deliberate, accidental or unauthorised WMD attacks or incidents.</u></strong> <u>North Korea has not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention</u> (CWC) but has signed the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) as well as the Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in war. The government denies having CW or biological weapons (BW) programs but claims to be threatened by South Korean and U.S. CBW even though Seoul and Washington are parties to the CWC, BTWC and the Geneva Protocol. South Korea had a CW program but completed the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile in 2008 and is in com- pliance with all its CBW arms control commitments. Despite a dismal economy, the North Korean regime appears stable. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">An international norm against</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> chemical and </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">biological weapons has emerged, but</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a few nations and </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">terrorist groups still seek</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to acquire </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">them.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Most states can produce chemical weapons on their own if they choose to, but North Korea could provide materials or technology for integrating CW munitions with delivery systems to shorten developmen- tal and deployment timelines. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The North’s</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> biotechnol- ogy capability is rudimentary, but </span><u>any biological agents or <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">BW technology</span> in its possession <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would be highly valued.

<u>Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">survival of life on earth</span></span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">While</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a &quot;nuclear</span> winter,&quot; resulting from a massive <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">exchange</span> of nuclear weapons, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could also kill off most of life</span> on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons</span></u> <u>because <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. </span><u>With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Potentially worse than that, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">bio-engineered agents</span></u> <u>by the hundreds with no known cure <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could</span> persistent <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">radiation.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE. Ironically, the Bush administration has just changed the U.S. nuclear doctrine to allow nuclear retaliation against threats upon allies by conventional weapons. The past doctrine allowed such use only as a last resort when our nation’s survival was at stake. Will the new policy also allow easier use of US bioweapons? How slippery is this slope? Against this tendency can be posed a rational alternative policy<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">To preclude possibilities of human extinction</span></u><u>, &quot;patriotism&quot; needs to be redefined to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">make humanity’s survival primary and absolute</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Even if we lose our cherished freedom, our sovereignty, our government or our Constitution, where there is life, there is hope. What good is anything else if humanity is extinguished? This concept should be promoted to the center of national debate.. For example, for sake of argument, suppose the ancient Israelites developed defensive bioweapons of mass destruction when they were enslaved by Egypt. Then suppose these weapons were released by design or accident and wiped everybody out? As bad as slavery is, extinction is worse. Our generation, our century, our epoch needs to take the long view. </span><u>We</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> truly </span><u>hold in our hands the precious gift of all future life.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Empires may come and go, but who are the honored custodians of life on earth? Temporal politicians? Corporate competitors? Strategic brinksmen? Military gamers? Inflated egos dripping with testosterone? How can any sane person believe that national sovereignty is more important than survival of the species? Now that extinction is possible, our slogan should be &quot;Where there is life, there is hope.&quot; No government, no economic system, no national pride, no religion, no political system can be placed above human survival. The egos of leaders must not blind us. The adrenaline and vengeance of a fight must not blind us. The game is over. If patriotism would extinguish humanity, then patriotism is the highest of all crimes.</span><br />

<strong>Advantage 2 is Japan-China Relations</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Japan and China currently have diverging views of regional cooperation that prevent an increase in relations—South Korean and Japanese cooperation solves because it makes Japan more willing to engage in dialogue</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Looking from this perspective, </span><u>one would also realise the fundamental <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">differences between Japan’s and China’s perspectives on evolving regionalism</span> in East Asia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, including the concept of an <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/tag/eac/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">East Asian Community</a>. </span><u>China’s regional outlook</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and its policies </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are still conditioned</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, at the deepest level, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">by</span> its preoccupation with the modern elements of diplomacy and international politics, including strong nationalism, a sense of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">rivalry with the U</span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span>tates, an unprecedented pace and scale of military modernisation, and preoccupation with territorial integrity</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Japan’s perspective on East Asian regionalism</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and its interests therein, in contrast, </span><u>are essentially post-industrial, including commitment to non-traditional security issues such as human security, problems common to rapidly evolving civil societies, and issues associated with aging societies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Of course, there are still modern elements in Japanese society and politics, which particularly tend to surface in an emotional vicious cycle over historical and territorial issues between <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/01/05/a-new-start-for-japan-china-relations/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Japan and China</a>. The main story in the evolution of Japanese diplomacy and thinking toward East Asian regionalism, however, has been largely, if not exclusively, a post-modern and post-industrial one. The first critical and explicit manifestation of this tendency was Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi’s policy speech in January 2002 proposing the establishment of an East Asian Community. Koizumi said to the audience in Singapore that, starting from Japan-ASEAN cooperation, the countries of ASEAN, Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand will be core members of such a community. </span><u>The Koizumi speech actually ignited a process of conceptual competition between China and Japan</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In particular, the inclusion of Australia and New Zealand embodied the line of division between the two. In the Japanese thinking, there still remains a concern about a China-centered process of community-building possibly developing into a closed region, reflecting Chinese preoccupation with modern values and interests such as national sovereignty and a sense of strategic rivalry vis-à-vis the United States over the long run. In this Japanese conception, the inclusion of Australia and New Zealand holds a double function. First, they provide a venting channel leading to the United States as a security anchor in East Asia, an important foundation of an East Asian Community from the Japanese perspective. Secondly, the membership of Australia and New Zealand is also important from the point of view of universal values that will sustain, as well as keep open, the basis of an East Asian Community to the rest of the world. Therefore, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">behind the competition over</span> the primary institution for community building between the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aseansec.org/4918.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__ASEAN+3__</a></span> formula, on the one hand, and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the East Asian Summit or</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">ASEAN+6</span> on the other, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">lies this conceptual rivalry</span>, if not geopolitical conflict, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">between Japan and China</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This should be a healthy competition in which the other East Asian nations, including </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the Japanese and the Chinese, would be involved through constructive dialogue and debate</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For such diplomatic approaches by Japan toward East Asia, the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/australia/joint0703.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation</a>, signed in March 2007, has important meanings. The actual context of the declaration reveals that the agreement is the embodiment of security cooperation between countries concerned about a set of non-traditional security and political issues. The declaration has no elements regarding traditional security such as territorial integrity or balance of power considerations. It specifically mentions Japan-Australia cooperation on non-traditional security issues, including law enforcement to combat transnational crime, disarmament and counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, peace operations, and humanitarian relief operations. From the perspective advanced in this essay, one would realise that similar </span><u>security cooperation should not be entirely impossible between Japan and South Korea. Indeed, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">if Japan and South Korea can establish a genuinely cooperative relationship as true equals</span> located between the United States and China, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">this will become an </span></u><strong><u>epoch-making trigger for a paradigm shift</u></strong> <u>in East Asian regionalism</u> . Under the dominant realities today, this perspective may sound rather normative. Nonetheless, it is not entirely without substance, <u>as evidenced by rapidly expanding civil society exchanges between Japan and South Korea and the coordination of alliance policies toward the United States</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Although it is a bit too early to judge where the new diplomacy by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) will go, there are indications that </span><u>this sort of paradigm shift may not be entirely impossible in the coming years</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Of</span> particular <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">importance is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama’s emphasis on </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Japan’s diplomacy toward</span> neighboring countries, i.e., <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">South Korea and China, in the</span> overall <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">context of an East Asian Community</span> concept. The idea is to start the community-building efforts with Japan’s most troubled relationships, i.e. those with South Korea and China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and his rather explicit approach to the history problems represents an important initiative in this overall context of a new East Asian diplomacy rather than simply in a bilateral context. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is fair to say that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">China has tried to moderate obstacles</span> in its bilateral relations <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">with Japan</span> by way of positioning its Japan policy as a part of its multilateral diplomacy in East Asia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

In this way, </span><u>East Asian cooperation can provide the two countries with more routes toward their cooperation and dialogue</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.7 In this respect, it is imperative that China’s policy toward East Asia is investigated in order to understand the future direction of its Japan policy. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Six decades have passed since World War II ended, but you wouldn’t know it from relations between </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">South Korea and Japan</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The two leading democratic, capitalist powers in East Asia – both close US allies – </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have been blustering over the status of</span> 33 barren but contested blocks of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">rock</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Cooperation</span> over truly important issues, such as denuclearizing North Korea and channeling Chinese ambitions in a positive direction, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has taken a back seat to</span> immature <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">political posturing</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This irresponsible behavior is made possible by Washington’s continued defense of both nations. Imperial Japan gained dominant influence in the peninsular kingdom in the late 1800s and formally annexed Korea as a colony in 1910. Tokyo’s policies were characteristically brutal: Korean culture was suppressed, Korean names were outlawed, and Korean labor was conscripted. During World War II the Japanese took Koreans as &quot;comfort women&quot; for Japanese soldiers on break from conquering East Asia and the Pacific. It’s no wonder that anti-Japanese feeling, strong throughout most of the region, was especially intense in Korea. Indeed, it was one of the few unifying features of a peninsula divided by the US and Soviet Union in 1945. These feelings were understandable, but the statute of limitations has run out. Japan’s wartime leaders all died long ago. Even most of the &quot;grunts&quot; are dead. The militaristic imperial order, devastated by Tokyo’s defeat, died along with them. The US disarmed Japan and imposed a &quot;peace constitution,&quot; which technically outlaws any military. Tokyo’s neighbors applauded, but American policymakers soon reconsidered. After the Chinese Revolution, Washington faced two large communist rivals in East Asia. In contrast, America’s allies were marginal: Australia and New Zealand small and distant, the Republic of Korea an economic and political wreck, the Philippines a third world state. Japan was America’s only potential powerful friend in Asia during the Cold War’s early years. Anti-Japanese taunts became a useful political tactic for political elites in the ROK and elsewhere, such as Singapore. Secure beneath America’s protective umbrella, these countries demanded that Tokyo eschew even the ability to defend itself. Japan didn’t help matters, with assorted politicians periodically sounding off on the alleged benefits of colonialism in Korea and visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, at which more than a thousand convicted war criminals are interred. Relations between South Korea and Japan have improved in recent years. Dissident Kim Dae-jung took refuge in Japan decades ago; he encouraged more positive bilateral ties after he was elected ROK president in 1997. Moreover, the horrifying brutality and criminality of the North Korean government eroded the support, financial as well as political, of Pyongyang by many ethnic Koreans living in Japan, most of whom had come from the North. Kim’s successor, Roh Moo-hyun, attempted to use anti-Japanese feeling to bolster his fading popularity, but President Lee Myun-bak, elected last December, advocated improving relations. Alas, the controversy over the Takeshima (Japanese name)/Dokdo (Korean name) Islands (or Liancourt Rocks in the West) has pushed relations backwards. (The surrounding waters are commonly known as the Sea of Japan, except in Korea, which calls them the East Sea. Just two Koreans, an octopus fisherman and his wife, live permanently on the assorted outcroppings – 56 acres in all – but every day hundreds of South Koreans visit. The voyage takes several hours and the unpredictable waves often prevent anyone from landing. Even when the sea cooperates, the visitors typically stay only 20 minutes. Nevertheless, 80,000 South Koreans have made the trek so far this year, a testament to the frivolous petulance which sometimes captures the popular psyche of the Republic of Korea. The competing claims are tied up with Tokyo’s military victory over Russia and – the cause of the issue’s emotional sensitivity in Korea – Japan’s subsequent takeover of the Korean peninsula. America occupied both the ROK and Japan at the end of World War II, but left the issue unresolved. South Korea installed a small police garrison in the 1950s to stake its claim and rejected Tokyo’s offer to bring the issue to the International Court of Justice. The two countries set the issue aside when they normalized relations in 1965, but controversy flared in 2005 when the government of Shimane prefecture in Japan declared Takeshima Day, celebrating Tokyo’s claim. In July the Japanese Ministry of Education issued a new manual for teachers and textbook publishers asserting Tokyo’s rightful ownership. Seoul called it &quot;an intolerable act,&quot; temporarily recalled its ambassador from Japan, canceled a scheduled meeting between the two countries’ foreign ministers, and sent Prime Minister Han Seung-soo to the islands. South Korean citizens demonstrated. The South even conducted military exercises nearby – to prepare for any Japanese provocation, noted Defense Minister Lee Sang-hee. North Korea, which has largely ignored the issue (the islands are much closer to the South), added its angry voice. The US was drawn into the controversy. The US Board on Geographic Names changed its listing of the islands from South Korean to &quot;undesignated sovereignty.&quot; The ROK predictably protested and, faced with the threat of popular protests during President George W. Bush’s planned visit to Seoul in early August, the White House ordered the Board to reverse itself. (A similar controversy enveloped the Library of Congress, which planned on listing the islets as Liancourt Rocks, before backing down under pressure.) In August Seoul arranged an international press delegation to Dokdo/Takeshima to build public support. South Korea says it may construct a marine science research station and village on the rocks next year. Hong Joon-pyo, an official in the ruling Grand National Party, sought to rally the ROK against &quot;the Japanese ambition for territorial aggression.&quot; Twenty-four-year-old Kim Eun-taek, a police conscript stationed on the islands, spoke for many of his countrymen when he told the <em>New York Times</em>: &quot;I feel immensely proud. Not every South Korean gets a chance to guard the easternmost territory of our nation. Besides, I never liked the Japanese.&quot; It seems inconceivable that either nation would ever use military force to advance its claim, but both send naval patrols into the surrounding waters. Still, </span><u>the more practical consequence of the controversy is to poison relations between the two countries</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. During abortive negotiations between the two states, one official observed: &quot;We would be better off if we just blow up the islands.&quot; He was right. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The advantages of cooperation between Japan and South Korea are obvious</span>. Economic ties are strong and the two are important trading partners. There is perhaps even greater cause to work together to promote their mutual security</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. North Korea remains an unpredictable and hostile force, especially with the status of dictator &quot;Dear Leader&quot; Kim Jong-il in question. China’s influence is growing, and while Beijing has been assertive rather than aggressive so far, </span><u>both South Korea and Japan would be more secure if they acted in tandem on geopolitical issues</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">neither feels much pressure to do so as long as Washington provides</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> both security guarantees and</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">military garrisons</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Indeed, </span><u>Seoul</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> cheerfully </span><u>subsidizes North Korea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as it constructs a nuclear arsenal, </span><u>while lobbying America to maintain its troop presence</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – and treating Japan as a potential threat. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The US should say no more</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>With the end of the Cold War the case for continued <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">American military domination</span> of East Asia disappeared. That policy <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">no longer serves US</span> security <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">interests, since</span> its <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">allies are</span> well <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">able to</span> defend themselves, and to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">cooperate</span> with each other in doing so. Moreover, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">attempting to maintain</span> Washington’s military <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">hegemony along China’s border is unsustainable</span>, as Beijing grows wealthier and more influential</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Escaping disputes like the South Korean-Japanese quarrel over who owns 33 worthless bits of rock a world away from America would be an added benefit of disengagement. </span><u>It’s time for Tokyo and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> especially </span><u>Seoul to</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> behave like serious members of the international community rather than spoiled teenagers, and </span><u>provide responsible leadership in East Asia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>The recent fishing boat incident raised tensions over disputed islands in the East China Sea—without normalization of relations, Japan will adopt a more provocative military policy in the East China Sea</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Watanabe, September 29, 2010</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – special to the Asahi Shimbun (Akio, “COMMENTARY/ No winners in Japan-China trawler showdown,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201009280411.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201009280411.html</a>) </span><br />
<u>China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> brought onto itself major negative fallout. For one thing, it </span><u>lost the feelings of expectation and trust toward China that the Japanese public was beginning to hold</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> recently. The other negative aspect is that China demonstrated to Asian nations and the world just how rough Chinese diplomacy really was. It would be a major mistake for China to be happy about the situation. On the other hand, it cannot be called a victory for Japanese diplomacy, either. Releasing the captain when both the prime minister and foreign minister were not in Japan was a sloppy handling of the matter. Although prosecutors said they made the decision independently, that was not possible because core elements of the government must have been involved. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Throughout the</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> entire </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">incident, the Japanese government lacked agility</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Considering China's recent unilateral actions in the South China Sea, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">there was a need to prepare for the occurrence of such an incident in Japan's territorial waters</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, did Japan conduct hypothetical tests and prepare for such possibilities? What actually happened was a hasty decision at a crucial juncture. In that sense, Japan's diplomacy was unprofessional. While it is unclear who the victor is, it is very evident what was lost due to the incident. Although Japan said it would &quot;proceed in an orderly manner&quot; and &quot;handle the matter calmly,&quot; that was insufficient. </span><u>What should have been the basis of its actions was a Japan-China relationship that was disciplined and that followed the solid principle that Japan &quot;would not allow any coercive change in the status quo.&quot;</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In that sense, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the loser in this incident can be said to be a</span> &quot;disciplined <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Japan-China relationship</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; Seen objectively, the Senkaku Islands are under the effective control of Japan. There is no legal or historical basis for China's argument that the islands are its territory. Trying to change that status by going against international law, treaties and international agreements is an act that disrupts order and must be said to lie outside a &quot;disciplined Japan-China relationship.&quot; China, therefore, has primary responsibility for the incident. However, Japan must also bear major responsibility. Has the Japanese government clearly made known its position to &quot;not allow any coercive change in the status quo?&quot; Were the political will and the strength of that will sufficient? Moreover, did Japan prepare the &quot;power&quot; that would be needed to support that will? In fact, Japan had neither a clear will nor the sufficient posture to persist with that will. </span><u>The incident has not reached a conclusion, yet</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What the Japanese government has to do is clarify its political will by stating what its position is and to lay out the principles that will be employed for the resolution of the issue. Beyond that, the issue becomes one of diplomatic technique, and there would be various ways of proceeding. However, </span><u>if Japan continues taking convenient measures without clear principles in place, that will only hurt a disciplined Japan-China relationship</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Sufficient consideration should be given to this point. </span><u>This will be an important precedent for the nations that are feeling a threat from the heavy-handed acts of China in the South China Sea.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In that sense, Japanese diplomacy must do its best. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">If Japan-China relations should become even more acrimonious, voices might arise in Japan calling for a more robust, </span></u><strong><u>military response</u></strong> . <br />

<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">If such a clash occurred, it would pose a serious dilemma for the United States. The U.S. commitment to defend Japan</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, enshrined in Article 5 of the Mutual Security Treaty, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">applies to “territories under the administration of Japan.” The Senkaku</span>/Diaoyu <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Islands are under Japan’s administrative control</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even though Washington takes no position on which state (China or Japan) has sovereignty over them under international law. Successive </span><u>U.<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S. administrations have reaffirmed that application</span>, suggesting that the United States would be legally obligated to assist Japan if the People’s Liberation Army attacked or seized the islands</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Washington seeks good relations with both China and Japan. It does not want to get drawn into a conflict between the two, especially one that it believed was not necessary to protect the vital interests of either. A Senkaku scenario is not, from the U.S. perspective, the issue where the American commitment to Japan is put to the test. But </span><u>Washington would understand that not responding would impose serious political costs on its relations with Tokyo and would raise questions about U.S. credibility more broadly among other states that depend on the United States for their security. Congressional and public opinion would probably favor Japan or, at least, oppose China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">At the end of 2010, the Korean Peninsula stood on the brink of an abyss of military conflict. North Korea threatened a “nuclear war disaster”<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if Seoul proceeded with its scheduled live-fire military exercise in the West Sea. </span>But<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the exercise went off as planned, </span>North Korea did nothing, and the region breathed a sigh of relief. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">President Lee Myung-bak can take credit for the display of South Korean resolve that forced Pyongyang to behave itself. The Lee administration was clearly ready, indeed eager, to react more sternly to another deadly North Korean provocation. While South Korea and its U.S. ally can take pride in staunching North Korean aggression, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the calm may be short-lived</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Like a crafty magician who draws attention to one hand while slipping the coin into his pocket with the other, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Kim Jong-il may be planning other provocative acts in 2011</span>,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> but away from the Northern Limit Line (NLL). South Korea must therefore prepare for a range of possible North Korean attacks. And that’s a challenge. As the ancient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu noted, if your opponent “sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.” </span>North Korea, as always, wants to retain the initiative and control the pace of the game. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">By incrementally ratcheting up tensions, Kim forces the U.S</span>. and others <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">into a reactive posture. And by creating a parallel crisis to divert attention from a negotiating impasse</span> brought on by its own intransigence, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Pyongyang hopes to raise the stakes before striking an eventual deal</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That way the regime is able to extract maximum benefits while providing minimal concessions. Yet, despite its history of engaging in high-risk, belligerent rhetoric and actions</span>, Pyongyang has always calibrated its tactics to avoid going beyond its opponents’ redlines<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Historically, after escalating tensions, Pyongyang has made conciliatory gestures, offering a return to the status quo ante. North Korea then cynically presents its “restraint” in not fulfilling its threats as evidence of its reasonableness and its willingness to negotiate. Even as the regime threatened war in December, its officials met with New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson. Pyongyang used Richardson’s visit to send a message that it was willing to allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to return to the Yongbyon nuclear facility. Doing so also diverted attention from Pyongyang’s disclosure of a uranium enrichment facility, yet another violation of U.N. resolutions. By alternating provocations with diplomatic outreach, Pyongyang seeks to leverage Washington and Seoul away from their pressure policies, such as U.N. sanctions against North Korea. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Currently</span> however, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">neither</span> the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Obama nor Lee</span> administrations <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">show any sign of easing the pressure.

<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Remarkably, despite all the commentary on the current crisis, to say nothing of the obvious stakes involved, scant attention has been given to how tensions might actually escalate rather than dissipate contrary to past experience. Certainly </span>plenty of commentators have warned about how “miscalculation,” “loss of control” and “unintended escalation” could trigger a new Korean war, but rarely beyond such broad generalizations and assertions. Conversely, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">those who discount the likelihood of significant escalation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> should the South retaliate militarily in the future </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have been no more forthcoming</span> in explaining why the risk remains low other <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">than repeating</span> the broad conviction th<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">at it is in neither side’s interests</span> to go to war. As we have seen in many cases, however, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">an expectation of rational behavior</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>especially for decision makers under conditions of stress and incomplete information­­—<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is not something that can be reliably assumed</span>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The propensity of another major clash on or around the peninsula to escalate militarily depends on numerous complex factors. Understanding them may seem like an arcane or academic exercise, but it is in fact critically important to considering how best to manage the current crisis and prevent the very outcome that everyone—including presumably the North Koreans—wishes to avoid. </span>Four interrelated variables are likely to be the critical ingredients to how another deadly clash might escalate<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These can be simplified as the “who, where, what and why” factors: W</span>ho’s Involved: In the most recent provocations, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">North Korea has evidently been careful to confine their operations to South Korean targets. A future incident that</span> either intentionally or accidentally <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">involves U.S. forces</span> or citizens in Korea <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">would</span> clearly <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">raise the stakes</span>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is has been some time since this has happened and one could infer that North Korea understands that the risks have grown too high and thus they will continue to refrain from any direct or harmful interactions with the United States. The decision to carry out joint U.S.-ROK naval exercises in the vicinity of the recent provocations presumably had this in mind to help deter further attacks. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Yet, how sure can we really be that North Korea would not target U.S. forces in the future</span>?<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Might they make the same calculation that the U.S. will be just as risk averse to taking retaliatory action as the ROK has been to date? And even if they do continue to avoid provocations that may involve the U.S., how confident are we that they would know when U.S. forces or citizens are not in harm’s way? Finally, while the involvement of the U.S. would clearly increase the risk of military escalation, </span>we should also not overlook the potential role of Japan. It too has been the target of past provocations and its tolerance for aggressive North Korean behavior has lessened considerably in recent years while its capacity for military retaliation has manifestly increased. Where the Interactions Take Place:<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As several analysts have pointed out, the Cheonan and Yeongpyeong incidents are the latest in a decade-long sequence of military clashes along the disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL)—all of which have stayed localized. Were additional incidents to occur in this same general area, the supposition is that South Korea would retaliate in the proximate vicinity and in a proportional way to reduce the risk of further escalation. This raises the question of whether North Korea would view South Korean retaliation against mainland, i.e. “on peninsular” targets—which are reportedly now being considered—as a qualitatively different and therefore disproportionate response regardless of how discrete or contained they were? There is no assurance, in any case, that North Korea would confine any future provocations to the NLL/Yellow Sea area. Meddling with the Kaesong Industrial Complex, including the detention of South Koreans who work there, has been mentioned as a possibility. Insertion of special forces into the South if only for reconnaissance purposes is also not out of the question. There have been plenty of precedents after all. Neither should Seoul be viewed as off limits as demonstrated by the failed assassination attempt in late 2009 by a North Korean “hit team” against their most senior defector Hwang Jang Yop. How South Korea would respond proportionately to these or similar types of activities are not immediately clear, though one can anticipate considerable public agitation to retaliate promptly. </span>What Type of Interactions Take Place: <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The scale, intensity, and nature of any further military interactions clearly have a major bearing on how a crisis would</span> subsequently <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">escalate</span>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Intermittent artillery duels across the NLL and even the DMZ would probably not precipitate a major outbreak of hostilities. </span>The <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">use of airpower</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> however, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">which has been raised as a possible</span> retaliatory <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">option by the new ROK Defense Minister, introduces a new, more uncertain element</span> since it entails the direct incursion of sovereign territory and thus represents a clearer political affront to the North. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(It also introduces the possibility of downed and captured pilots that could also complicate matters). Targeting major symbols of national power such as nuclear facilities and missile bases—however surgically undertaken—would undoubtedly represent a still greater challenge to the North which we can reliably assume would not go unanswered. The most important variable, however, will be the perceived operational status of each side’s main offensive capabilities. If either North or South Korea perceives that opposing forces are being readied to engage in large scale offensive operations, the incentives to strike first will inevitably increase. For the North the reason would be to avert the almost certain demise of the regime and for the South it would be to minimize the risk to Seoul. But, as has often been observed, </span>precautionary <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">defensive measures designed to bolster deterrence are not easily distinguishable from offensive preparations and thus the potential for miscalculation exists</span>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Here changes to the size, disposition, and alert status of U.S. forces in and around Korea, including the potential activation of reinforcements and the evacuation of non-combatants from forward areas, will be absolutely critical to perceptions of intent. </span>Why Further Provocations are Initiated: <span style="font-size: 8pt;">If North Korea’s recent actions along the NLL are really just the latest manifestations of a more than decade long effort to redress perceived grievances about the maritime border and, moreover, to settle scores with the South Korean military for previous setbacks, then new provocations for this purpose and the likely response that they prompt would probably keep the crisis from escalating significantly, notwithstanding the cautionary factors noted above. However, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">if North Korea conducts further military provocations</span> primarily <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">for</span> the purpose of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">relieving the diplomatic and economic pressure</span> that has been brought to bear on it in recent years<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (or it feels that negotiations are not producing sufficient concessions), </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">South Korean retaliation would</span> presumably <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have to incur significantly extra costs to make North Korea desist</span> from continuing its campaign. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This</span> also presumably <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">increases the odds that Pyongyang would feel compelled to respond in kind, which could set in motion a dangerous escalatory dynamic</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">if the leadership in Pyongyang is</span> primarily<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or even secondarily </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">motivated</span> by the desire <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">embarrass the leadership in Seoul and/or </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">bolster the legitimacy of the heir apparent</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—Kim Jong Il’s young and inexperienced third son, Kim Jong Un—</span>through further provocations, then <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">additional escalatory pressures could come into play</span>. Not only would it likely increase the demands on the South to respond forcefully, but its subsequent retaliation would likely be harder for the North to ignore because of its potential harmful effect on the standing of the designated successor<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Potential voices of caution and restraint could in the process become muted to avoid appearing less than fully supportive or loyal to the new leadership. Indeed, to curry favor, the incentives to be bold and aggressive may actually increase. This will be especially true if Kim Jong Un is personally directing the recent provocations as some believe he is. </span></span><br />

<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The Korean Peninsula </span>remains one of the most dangerous hotspots in the Asia Pacific.

The South Korean military has responded with its own artillery bombardment of the North Korean positions. This latest development is merely another in a long history of similar crises, often seemingly unprovoked. </span><u>It</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nevertheless </span><u>threatens to undermine the strategic stability of the Korean Peninsula</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The concept of strategic stability is simple enough: it refers to a condition where strategies that states use to ensure their security remain unchanged, that these strategies remain stable. The critical question that analysts of international security ask is when does strategic stability between two states come under threat? Strategic stability depends upon three elements that together shape the particular inter-state relationship: strategic culture, geography, and military balances. Strategic culture shapes how opposing sets of policymakers view one another, whether or not they view each other with any hostility and suspicion. Geography and the military balance shape the sense of security that either side of this relationship feels at any given time. Natural defences – mountain ranges, wide rivers or open seas – tend to confer a sense of security. However this sense of naturally conferred security can be overcome if, say, the other side acquired military capabilities – say, long-range ballistic missiles – that nullified these natural defences. Latent Instability in the Korean Peninsula </span><u>The Korean War Armistice has lasted longer than some peace treaties have, and as such <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it is tempting to consider the peninsula as intrinsically stable. However, this stability may be more apparent than real</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Culturally, the Korean Peninsula is more or less homogenous. However, this shared culture did not prevent the outbreak of the Korean War. The fact that the Armistice has held longer than some peace treaties deflects attention away from many crises that have erupted since the 1950s, brought about by actions perpetrated by the North: several attempts to assassinate various South Korean presidents; occasional skirmishes across the DMZ; hijacking and bombings of Korean Airlines aircraft; more recently, the sinking of the Cheonan. </span><u>The <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">geography </span>of the Korean peninsula <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">definitely does not encourage </span>a sense of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">stability</span>, at least for South Korea, whose political and economic centre of gravity Seoul comes within range of North Korean artillery.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Perhaps the only geographic condition that facilitates strategic stability is the awareness that the physical geography – the central mountain range that runs down the spine of the peninsula in particular – does not facilitate quick and decisive military operations. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The military balance provides grounds for</span> further <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">discomfort</span>, because although South Korea is unequivocally stronger than <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">North Korea</span>, the latter <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">has</span> long <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">been suspected of having</span> acquired nuclear weapons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As it stands, it is likely that the North has always maintained a powerful chemical and biological weapons capability. </span><u>Given</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its moribund economy and </span><u>the South’s conventional superiority, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nuclear, biological and chemical weapons</span> are an attractive and apparently cheap strategic option for the North</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “</span><u>It only takes a spark”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “It only takes a spark” </span><u>The fact,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> however, </span><u>that the Armistice has held therefore requires explanation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The absence of strategic stability manifests itself in the sudden change of security strategies towards violence. As the history of the Korean Armistice demonstrates, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the absence of sudden</span> strategic shifts <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">does not necessarily preclude the absence of these elements of strategic stability</span>. The three elements are analogous to the same elements needed for a fire – fuel, tinder and oxygen. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">What is needed to turn these elements into fire is a spark. </span>This intervention comes in the form of politics – both the politics within both Koreas, and the inter-state political relationship.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is important that domestic politics in both states is stable, that neither set of policy elites is under domestic challenge. Where at least one set of policy elites is under domestic challenge, however, this is where this set of policy elites may be tempted to create an external distraction away from their domestic woes. Where both sets of policy elites are under domestic challenge, however, this is where the dangers of miscalculation leading to uncontrollable dynamics rise significantly. What kept the strategic stability of the Korean peninsula since the Armistice was that neither set of policy elites across the DMZ were under significant domestic challenge. Syngman Rhee and later Park Chung Hee were both not very popular, but maintained control in Seoul through strong-arm tactics that stifled domestic challenges.

Kim Il Sung had a vice-like grip over North Korea. His son, Kim Jong Il had a fairly long apprenticeship, and he seems to have managed to maintain a strong grip over the ruling party and the North Korean military. However, his appointed successor, Kim Jong Un, is an unknown element, even within North Korean political and military circles. It will almost certainly take some time for Kim Jong Un to establish his control over the rest of the North Korean policy and military establishments. </span><u>Under such conditions, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">sparks from otherwise minor incidents</span> can assume a significance far beyond the actual event.

Thankfully, </span><u>even Pyongyang doesn’t want to revive that conflict, but <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the possibility of mistake and accident remain</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Naturally, the United States reiterated its usual security guarantees. The White House said America was “firmly committed” to the South’s defense. But </span><u>why is Washington mixed up in potential hostilities on the Korean Peninsula</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? The U.S. commitment grew out of World War II. Washington divided occupation duties on the peninsula, a colony of defeated Japan, with the Soviet Union. Two separate countries emerged, followed by a three-year conflict, in which America intervened. In 1953 the warring sides agreed to an armistice. The United States gave South Korea a defense treaty and military garrison to keep the peace. Since then the world has changed. The Republic of Korea has rushed past its northern antagonist economically. With the thirteenth-largest economy in the world, the ROK now has about forty times the GDP of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. South Korea also has twice the DPRK’s population, as well as a vast technological edge. Moreover, Seoul has detached North Korea’s traditional allies. The Soviet Union went AWOL under Mikhail Gorbachev. Although Vladimir Putin’s Moscow has somewhat repaired its relationship with Pyongyang, Russia still has a far more important economic relationship with the ROK. So does China, which trades fifty times as much with the South as with the North. Only in military strength does the DPRK retain a numerical edge over Seoul. North Korea has 1.1 million men under arms, an impressive number, but individual conscripts tend to be malnourished and of uncertain quality. Their weapons are antiquated. A prime fighting force the North Korean military is not. The South only has about seven hundred thousand men under arms, but they are better trained and deploy better weapons. In any case, Seoul has the resources to provide whatever it believes necessary for its own defense. There is no special gravitational field on the peninsula that keeps the ROK military numerically inferior. South Korea simply prefers to spend its money on economic development. It was one thing for the United States to subsidize the South’s defense when that nation was vulnerable to an attack by the DPRK backed by China and the Soviet Union. That’s no longer the case. </span><u>America’s military commitment also didn’t seem to matter much when no one imagined another war was really possible.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> When the North’s “Dear Leader” Kim Jong Il was holding summits with South Korea’s presidents, conflict seemed far away. </span><u>But last March the DPRK apparently sank a South Korean warship.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Seoul did little, other than demand an apology—a demand which the government of President Lee Myung-bak recently retracted. </span><u>Now the North has staged another violent incident. Even though <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Pyongyang</span> almost certainly does not want war, its <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">provocative behavior risks triggering</span> one, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a conflict in which the U.S. would immediately become involved</span>. In fact, there have been proposals for retaliation against the North backed by Washington. Such a step could start a war directly. There’s no justification for keeping the United States in between the two Koreas. It is long past time for Seoul to develop whatever size military it believes to be necessary</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and whatever policy towards the North it believes to be appropriate—and to accept the consequences accordingly. The ROK is strong enough to do what important countries traditionally have done throughout history, defend itself. Washington’s one area of genuine interest, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nonproliferation, is not advanced by a troop presence in the South. In fact, those are the only Americans within the North’s reach.</span> They are, in effect, nuclear hostages</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if Pyongyang develops nuclear weapons and delivery systems. </span><u>The latest intra-Korean skirmish should serve as that proverbial fire bell in the night. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Alliances can</span> deter. They also can <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">entangle</span>. In the case of South Korea <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the security relationship risks drawing the United States into wa</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">r</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with no countervailing benefits for Americans. After all, the ROK no longer is central to a larger international struggle, as it was during the Cold War. And </span><u>the South is capable of deterring the DPRK and winning any conflict that might erupt.</u><br />

<u>Is it North or <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">South Korean brinkmanship that is risking a new Korean War</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? POHANG, SOUTH KOREA. &quot;Just let me know if I have to worry,&quot; read my mother's email. With her son living in South Korea for close to fifteen years, we have been through this several times. Whenever North Korea is in the news, she naturally worries about my safety, and now that I've given her a lovely daughter-in-law and two beautiful children, her worries have quadrupled. Since I've been here, there have been raids by commandoes, missile launches, alleged nuclear tests, threats of a &quot;Sea of fire,&quot; two sea battles, claiming six and forty-six South Korean sailors respectively, and, most recently the first artillery exchange since the 1953 armistice that lulled the Korean War, in which four South Koreans, including, most disturbingly, two civilians, were killed. When I first got here, I, too was, spooked whenever North Korea was in the news, but I soon did what any resdient of a foreign country should do; I learned from the locals. I saw that South Koreans didn't care. They ignored the news coming from the North. They acted like the sibling of someone with Tourette's Syndrone or severe Autism; while the behavior looked scary to outsiders, they were used to it. Those of us who've been &quot;in country&quot; a few years like to laugh at the &quot;rookies&quot; who get all jittery and start packing their bags whenever CNN finds it necessary to show scary pictures of menacing North Korean soldiers at PanmunjÅm. So I wrote back to my mother, &quot;You don't have to worry, Mom.&quot; I lied. </span><u>This time is different. This year, South Koreans are talking about it.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The naval battle on the eve of the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup was ignored. (A traffic accident invovling the US military at the same time, in which two middle school girls tragically died, was not ignored; there were anti-American demonstrations that brought hundreds of thousands to the streets, unreported by most mainstream media in America.) </span><u>The sinking of the Cheonan earlier this year was not ignored</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, perhaps because the loss of life was so great. The 46 sailors were properly mourned, and, along with the anger directed northward, there seemed to be even more conspiracy analysis in the South regarding their government's version of the story. </span><u>Things are really different with last month's shelling of the disputed Yeonpyeong Island</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, perhaps because of the loss of civilian life and property. My students and colleagues are talking about this event, bringing it up freely, voicing their concerns and fears. I, too, am a bit nervous, but I'm less nervous about what P'yÅngyang (and Beijing) might intentionally do than what Seoul (and Washington) might accidentally do. A day after the November 23rd </span><u>Yeonpyeong</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> attack, Justin Raimondo rightly noted that </span><u>&quot;the South Koreans were conducting military 'exercises' near the disputed island</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which North Korea claims as its territory, and South Korean ships had opened fire,&quot; going on to suggest that &quot;the military exercises, code-named 'Hoguk,' involving all four branches of the South Korean armed forces and some 70,000 troops, simulated an attack on North Korea, and were meant to provoke the North Koreans, who responded as might be expected&quot; [Korean Conundrum: Is There a Way Out?]. He continued, &quot;US troops were supposed to have participated in the exercises, but apparently the Americans thought better of it and pulled back at the last moment -- perhaps because they knew a provocation was in the making&quot; [ibid]. Mr. Raimondo went on to argue, even more pointedly, &quot;For the South Koreans to conduct military exercises in this explosive region, never mind firing off rounds, is nothing but a naked provocation of the sort the West routinely ascribes to Pyongyang. In the context of North Korea's recent revelation that it is increasing its nuclear capacity, the South Korean military maneuvers were meant to elicit a violent response and succeeded in doing so&quot; [ibid]. A few days later, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said of the incident, &quot;Launching a military attack on civilians is a crime against humanity, even during wartime&quot; [South Korean president takes responsibility for failing to protect country, signals hardened military stance toward North]. Of course, he is about right attacks on civilians being crimes against humanity, but he said nothing of the irresponsibility of holding war games so close to an inhabited and disputed island. Speaking of President Lee, analyst Peter Lee has argued that &quot;significant North Asian takeaways from the WikiLeaks cables&quot; clearly show that &quot;South Korea, under President Lee Myung-bak, wants the North to collapse and to dominate the reunification process&quot; (while &quot;North Korea is desperate to establish relations with the United States&quot;) and that &quot;South Korean government officials are indefatigably, crudely and rather transparently 'working the refs' - selectively packaging and vociferously pushing their arguments - to persuade the United States to abandon mediation through the People's Republic of China (PRC) and/or negotiation with North Korea and instead put South Korea and its reunification agenda in the diplomatic driver's seat&quot; [Dear Leader's designs on Uncle Sam]. Since the </span><u>Yeonpyeong</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> attack, there have been joint games with the United States, which sent the U.S.S. George Washington, against Chinese warnings (not to mention the warnings of George Washington against &quot;foreign entanglements&quot;). These were followed by joint war games between the United States and Japan, who has her own territorial dispute with Russia, leading South Korean journalist Yi Yong-in to warn that &quot;a 'three against three' framework with South Korea, the United States and Japan on one side and North Korea, China, and Russia on the other is showing signs of taking shape once again&quot; and to speak of a &quot;New Cold War&quot; [Cold War alliances reborn with regional tension]. If the danger of a &quot;New Cold War&quot; were not bad enough, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">there is the very real danger of a hot war, with South Korea</span> launching its own live fire war games in dozens of areas around the peninsula and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">warning of responding to any North Korean reaction</span> with air strikes:</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span><u>The extent of possible <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">South Korean air strikes</span> on the North is not clear, but anything other than an extremely limited and localized action <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is likely to trigger total war,&quot; warned Koreanologist Gregory Elich, &quot;a war that the U.S. will inevitably be drawn into</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; [Menacing North Korea]. The last total war on this peninsula resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, hundreds of thousands of Chinese, and millions of Koreas. </span><u>Even a cursory glance at <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">world history shows how a minor incident can escalate to a total war</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Of this possibility, </span><u>fellow Korea resident Andray Abrahamian has reminded us, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">&quot;If</span> through <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">an overly aggressive deterrence posture war breaks out, millions on both sides could die</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [and] the two generations of sweat and tears that drove South Korea's economic growth could be undone,&quot; rightly concluding that &quot;it is absolutely inappropriate for foreign Korea-watchers to call for greater aggression in confronting the North&quot; [Pyongyang stretches deterrence limits].) </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The international community is increasingly aware that cooperative diplomacy is the most productive way to tackle the multiple, interconnected global challenges facing humanity, not least of which is the increasing proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Korea and Northeast Asia are instances where risks of</span> nuclear proliferation and actual <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nuclear use</span> arguably <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have increased</span> in recent years.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This negative trend is a product of continued US nuclear threat projection against the DPRK as part of a general program of coercive diplomacy in this region, North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, the breakdown in the Chinese-hosted Six Party Talks towards the end of the Bush Administration, regional concerns over China’s increasing military power, and concerns within some quarters in regional states (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) about whether US extended deterrence (“nuclear umbrella”) afforded under bilateral security treaties can be relied upon for protection. </span><u>The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not only for the Northeast Asian region but </span><u>for the whole international community.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> At worst, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">there is the <strong>possibility of nuclear attack</strong></span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">1</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,</span> <u>whether <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">intention, miscalculation, or</span></strong></span><strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> merely <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">accident</span></span></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. </span><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust</span> of unprecedented proportions.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).</span><u>The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: That is not global winter, but </span><u>the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…</span><u>The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">…To make matters even worse, </span><u>such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4 These, of course, are not the only consequences. </span><u>Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<u>North Korea’s artillery attack on a South Korean island on Tuesday was the latest in a series of Pyongyang’s aggressive moves over the past year and a half. They started with ballistic missile tests in April</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of last year, </span><u>soon followed by a nuclear test in May</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Kim Jong Il, who may be mad, </span><u>upped the ante last March with the sinking of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a South Korean corvette, </span><u>the Cheonan</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, with the loss of 46 lives. Given his erratic ways and the hellish nature of his regime, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">America would be well advised to leave</span> the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Korea</span>ns, north and south, to sort out their differences well alone</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Contrary to the flawed and ignorant New York Times “analysis,” </span><u>the artillery attack had nothing to do with North Korea feeling “under stress or threatened”</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">by the international sanctions, or “frustrated” with the U.S. negotiating position on its nuclear enrichment program. If this were true, all that is needed is a signal from the White House that America is ready for another round of talks and the tension will subside. </span><u>Even less was the barrage connected to alleged “recent moves by the ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong-il to position his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, as heir apparent.”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The claim that the Beloved Leader is trying to ensure “that the Kim family dynasty continues for a third generation by winning the loyalty of the powerful military with shows of force” is laughable. The loyalty of North Korea’s officers does not need to be “won,” as any hint that it is anything but total means the death of the suspect. In any event, at the metaphysical level of North Korea’s brand of dialectics the succession debate is superfluous: it is Kim Il Sung—the Great Leader, the Beloved Leader’s father—who is still in charge of the country, having been appointed “Eternal President” by the Supreme People’s Assembly in 1994, four years before his temporal death. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">North Korea is acting aggressively because it is weak. Its economy</span>—a surreal mix of Stalinist central planning and Maoist autarky—<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">cannot feed its</span> twenty-odd million <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">people</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Two million are estimated to have died of starvation over the past decade and a half.) Food and money assistance from the South have stopped coming. Kim wants the flow resumed, and he is being obnoxious in the hope of getting a bribe to be tolerable once again. If offered a peace treaty that’s to his liking, he may even become nice. If he gets nothing, he’ll do something even uglier in a few weeks or months. It is a crude ploy, but he is a crude man. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The only reason Kim</span>’s histrionics <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">matter</span> to the United States <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the existence of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the</span> anachronistic and unnecessary <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">presence of American troops in South Korea. The best way to deal with the problem is for the United States to withdraw all its troops from the Korean peninsula</span></u> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and le</span>t those most affected by Pyongyang’s behavior—<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">South Korea</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Japan, China</span>, and Russia—<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">deal with Kim</span> as they deem fit</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The U.S. withdrawal from the Korean peninsula should be accompanied by a quiet nod to Seoul to go ahead and develop its own nuclear deterrent. Back in the 1970s the Ford Administration induced South Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program in return for not withdrawing American soldiers. Now is the time to reverse the sequence: Washington should grant a free nuclear hand to Seoul in return for the U.S. withdrawal. South Korea has a strong civilian nuclear program with many dual-use activities in place, a physical infrastructure and a technical capability that may result in a credible deterrent within a year or two. As I noted in this column over two years ago, removing the American umbrella from South Korea would be beneficial to both sides because </span><u>the U.S. would be disengaged from a spot where <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the dangers of continued military presence exceed benefits</span>, while <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">South Korea would be forced to end its dependence on Washington for its defense</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">: </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">American withdrawal would prompt South Korea finally to become a</span> mature, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">self-reliant regional power</span> fully responsible for its self-protection, as befits one of the most highly developed industrial economies in the world</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>It would also force it to diversify its portfolio of foreign contacts, possibly leading to a Russian-South Korean or a Chinese-South Korean alliance, either of which is preferable to an open-ended American guarantee</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Some South Koreans are bound to start dragging their feet while simultaneously clamoring for continued U.S. security guarantee. It would not be the first time, but they should be told that </span><u>America has no national interest in <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">retaining troops in Korea</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or in continuing to protect Seoul. Old habits may die hard, but </span><u>the 55-year habit of garrisoning South Korea has to be kicked because it <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is dangerous, expensive, and unnecessary.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> To the argument that South Korea’s military is not strong enough to withstand the threat from the North, the answer is clear: </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">only by removing our tripwire can</span> America finally <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">force South Korea to upgrade its military</span> and to make its people assume the full economic and political burden of defending their own country.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For exactly the same reason American troops should be removed from Japan and Germany. A strategic anachronism five decades old would thus be finally ended. The above conclusions from October 2008 still stand, word for word. </span><br />

The US, however, put the kibosh on that hopeful scenario. That didn’t stop the South Koreans, however: over US opposition, Dae-jung’s heir pursued the sunshine policy with even more vigor, traveling to North Korea and stepping over the physical border – but it was not to be.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">What I do know is that U.S. was drawn into the Korean Peninsula during the Cold War and as part of an effort to contain the threat of Communist military aggression -- in the form of Communist China -- in Northeast Asia. Despite the fact that the Cold War ended a while ago (that I also know) </span><u>U.S. military commitment</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><u>was formalized through a security agreement with South Korea and is demonstrated by <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the continuing presence of 37,000 U.S. troops in that country is still in place</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The main threat that is being raised as a way of justifying this U.S. military commitment and presence is that of North Korea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In particular, Pyongyang's drive to develop nuclear military capability has become the main rationale for U.S. military intervention in the Korean Peninsula. </span><u>Ironically, one of the reasons that North Korea has taken the nuclear military direction has to do with legitimate concerns -- considering U.S. policies in Iraq and elsewhere -- over a possible U.S. attempt to do a &quot;regime change&quot; in Pyongyang.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In any case, the main threat that North Korea is posing today is to its neighbors in northeast Asia. There is the long-term concern over the economic problems, including the flow of refugees into South Korea and China that could follow the collapse of North Korean. And there is no reason why Japan and South Korea should not be worried over the rise of a nuclear North Korea. Indeed, these worst-case-scenarios reflect what should be seen as direct threat to the core national interests of South Korea, Japan -- and China -- and not to that of the U.S. It is not difficult to imagine the U.S. response if the central government in Mexico disintegrates and/or if Chavez's Venezuela goes nuclear. But </span><u>Korea is not in America's strategic backyard but in China's.

Washington could help by working with Seoul and Tokyo -- and Beijing -- in drawing an outline for a timeline for a nuclear military disarmament of North Korea as part of a package deal involving economic assistance to the North as well as process of diplomatic détente with that government, including ties with Washington (and perhaps eventually the peaceful reunification of the peninsula). There is no doubt that it is China, as Pyongyang's only regional (and global) patron, that would have to play the main role in forcing North Korea to accept such a deal. </span><u>The alternative should not be an all-out war in the Korean Peninsula involving U.S. troops, but an American &quot;green light&quot; to Seoul and Tokyo to take all the necessary steps to protect their security</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- including the nuclear military option.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">C</span><u>hina yesterday called for emergency direct diplomacy with North Korea in order to lower escalating tensions following last week's artillery attack on South Korea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (see GSN, Nov. 24). </span><u>However, the United States and its allies said now is not the time to address Pyongyang's demands for new six-party talks.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">North Korea's shelling of the inhabited South Korean island of Yeonpyeong resulted in the deaths of several soldiers and civilians and injuries to nearly 20 more. The incident directly followed news from Washington that Pyongyang revealed to visiting U.S. experts earlier this month that it had covertly built a large-scale advanced uranium enrichment facility at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, the Wall Street Journal reported. The two events have renewed international attention on the North Korean nuclear impasse. Beijing dispatched its senior foreign affairs official to lead a delegation to Seoul over the weekend for talks on the crisis. However, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak told the Chinese visitors that it was not the &quot;right time&quot; to relaunch long-stalled six-nation talks aimed at the permament denuclearization of North Korea, according to an administration official. The nuclear talks involve China, Japan, the two Koreas, Russia and the United States. They were last held almost two years ago. Pyongyang withdrew from the negotiations in April 2009 and one month later carried out its second nuclear weapons test, an action for which it was punished with heightened U.N. Security Council sanctions. The North for some time has declared its willingness to return to the nuclear talks. However, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo are leery of returning to a negotiating framework that has been used by the North in the past as a means to win international concessions only to later resume work on its nuclear weapons program. The three allies have called on Pyongyang to demonstrate its &quot;sincere&quot; commitment to nuclear disarmament before they will agree to resume negotiations. China is North Korea's strongest foreign ally and chief economic benefactor. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Beijing's continued support of</span> the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Kim Jong Il</span> regime <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is</span> frequently cited in Washington as <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the only thing keeping the</span> Stalinist <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">government from collapsing</span>. Because of this, China has come under growing criticism from the international community to do more to press North Korea over its belligerent behavior</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;It's hard to know why China doesn't push harder,&quot; Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a CNN interview aired yesterday. &quot;They clearly are interested in this -- in the region not spinning out of control -- so my sense is they try to control this guy, and I'm not sure he is controllable.&quot; Lee yesterday told Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo in blunt remarks that China must take a &quot;more fair and responsible position&quot; on peninsula affairs and leave Cold War-era considerations behind, according to presidential spokesman Hong Sang-pyo. In a television address today, Lee pledged North Korea &quot;would pay a price&quot; for any future hostilities and said that &quot;more endurance and forgiveness would only result in bigger provocations&quot; (Fairclough/Ramstad, Wall Street Journal I, Nov. 28). Japan today dismissed Beijing's call for direct talks with North Korea. Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said it would be &quot;unacceptable for us to hold six-party talks only because North Korea has gone amok,&quot; the Wall Street Journal reported (Yuka Hayashi, Wall Street Journal II, Nov. 29). The United States has yet to give a response to China's call for emergency talks, saying it would carry out discussions with the South Korean government first, Reuters reported. A high-ranking Pyongyang official voiced doubts about Beijing's initiative to engage in discussions. While the North has not responded to China's call, the unidentified official told Kyodo News that countries involved in the latest incident should meet for talks first (Laurence/Choonsik, Reuters, Nov. 29). </span><u>While urging that the two Koreas to refrain from actions that would raise tensions on the peninsula, China has abstained from condemning Pyongyang's shelling of the South Korean island, indicating that Beijing will refuse</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the urging of Washington and other states </span><u>to punish the North</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the Los Angeles Times reported last Thursday. North Korea's presumed possession of the nuclear bomb, its large arsenal of chemical weapons and a massive standing army make a military assault on the isolated state an unattractive option, according to reports. The United States and much of the international community have already drastically curtailed trade relations with the Stalinist state. In the White House view, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">China remains the only nation to have sway over the North and the only hope of producing a change in the Korean nuclear impasse. &quot;China is pivotal to moving North Korea in a fundamentally different direction,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;You can go [to] the U.N. Security Council or call for a five-party meeting (minus North Korea). But first you've got to go after China,&quot; said Victor Cha, point man for North Korean policy during the Bush administration. </span><br />

North Korea recently shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong after a period of escalating tensions, killing two soldiers and two civilians. North Korea claims that it opened fire after being provoked by a South Korean exercise. In response to the shelling incident the US and South Korea have conducted joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea. These involved a US aircraft carrier and are regarded as threatening not only by North Korea but also by China. China’s economic and diplomatic support for North Korea undermines efforts by other countries to affect the behavior of the regime in Pyongyang. Even China is troubled by North Korean behavior. The North Korean nuclear program, and the risks Pyongyang is running in escalating tensions with South Korea and the US, are counter to China’s security interests. Theoretically, the Chinese government could therefore decide to put pressure on Pyongyang by limiting its economic support and by ending the diplomatic support it often gives in the United Nations Security Council. It is very unlikely that China’s policy towards North Korea will change much. The US diplomatic reports revealed by WikiLeaks are a confirmation of uneasy Sino-North Korean relations rather than an indication that this relationship is about to change. China will probably continue to give more support than any other country because it is highly vulnerable to the consequences of political or economic collapse in North Korea. The longest and most accessible border of North Korea is the one it shares with China. Chaos in North Korea would harm stability in China’s northeast, the region formerly known as Manchuria. Moreover, Beijing is less motivated to put pressure on the North Korean regime than other countries are. The US is primarily interested in preventing the proliferation of nuclear technologies from North Korea. South Korea and Japan are mainly worried about the military threat from the north. Compared with these countries, China is less concerned about such issues. </span>The most fundamental element in China’s policy towards North Korea is that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Beijing regards the US as a greater security threat than the situation on the</span> Korean <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">peninsula</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Since neither China nor the US is by itself the predominant great power in Korean affairs, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Beijing can only assume responsibility for regional stability</span> if it does so <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">jointly</span> with the US. However, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this will not happen since China and the US each regard one another as their </span>main potential <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">military adversary</span>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> They also have contrary interests on the Korean peninsula. While </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">China regards the US military presence in South Korea as a potential threat that should eventually be removed, the US intends to maintain this presence as it helps to limit Chinese regional influence</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang cannot be seen apart from this context of geopolitical rivalry. It is desirable for China that the regime in North Korea continues to exist and that the Chinese government retains a certain degree of influence in Pyongyang. </span>A major precondition for China to change its policy towards North Korea is an improvement in Sino-US relations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the past months these have been deteriorating. This is the result of China’s growing power, and America’s increasing concern that Beijing is not using its influence for the right purposes. Washington has been strengthening its strategic ties with actors such as Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia and India. The US government has also shown greater involvement in territorial disputes between China and some of its neighbours. It is likely that, from a Chinese perspective, the US deploying an aircraft carrier in the Yellow Sea is merely the latest attempt by Washington to exploit a regional security crisis in order to strengthen its own position and weaken that of China. </span>The American dual strategy of trying to get China to put pressure on North Korea while at the same time attempting to limit the growth of Chinese influence in regional affairs is unlikely to result in a more stable Korean peninsula. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Indeed, </span>U.S. China policy today looks a lot like good old-fashioned rollback, isolating China instead of incorporating it into a win-win multi-polar system. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The West</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ern press, </span>distracted by individual issues such as<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Iran sanctions, Google, and </span>the Cheonan sinking, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">seems oblivious to the fact that the</span> U.S.-China <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">relationship has lurched into zero-sum territory</span> and relations are in the deep freeze,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> largely as the result of the willingness of the Obama administration to confront China in pursuit of its agenda. The Chinese media, on the other hand, talks about nothing else. Observers who believe that China will yield to U.S. pressure as long as its access to world markets is assured are ignoring unmistakable signs that Beijing has decided that, while its economic interests are vital, it must be prepared to downplay short-term economic gain in order to ensure its geopolitical position and national future Even in its inception, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">U.S. demands for “strategic reassurance” were </span>inherently <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">unequal</span>, framed <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">as something that China had to provide</span> up front <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">before the U.S.</span> would reciprocate<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg described the doctrine at a Center for a New American Security conference on China in September 2009. The onus for reassurance was put on China in a way that Beijing undoubtedly found grating. (1) U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg with Lee Myung-bak Strategic reassurance rests on a core, if tacit, bargain. Just as we and our allies must make clear that we are prepared to welcome China’s “arrival”, as you all have so nicely put it, as a prosperous and successful power, China must reassure the rest of the world that its development and growing global role will not come at the expense of security and well-being of others. Bolstering that bargain must be a priority in the U.S.-China relationship. And strategic reassurance must find ways to highlight and reinforce the areas of common interest, while addressing the sources of mistrust directly, whether they be political, military or economic</span>. Steinberg proceeded to list<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> five </span>areas of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> &quot;impressive&quot; </span>cooperatio<span style="font-size: 8pt;">n: reviving the global economy, </span>denuclearizing North Korea<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, dealing with Iran's nuclear program, mitigating climate change, and anti-terrorism and anti-piracy. In retrospect, it is clear that in only two areas--the global economy and anti-terrorism/piracy--do the U.S. and China share a genuine identity of interests, while </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">with respect to North Korea</span>,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Iran and climate change, among other issues, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">U.S. and Chinese positions remain</span> fundamentally <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">at odds</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And in the key area of the global economy, agreement is by no means absolute. While appreciating the massive Chinese domestic stimulus program (and the equally massive Chinese purchases of U.S. sovereign debt), U.S. plans for the new economic order clearly include a stronger Chinese currency—a situation that Mr. Steinberg alluded to when he described the three &quot;continued areas of mistrust and disagreement&quot;: China's military expansion, global resource competition, and the economic relationship. Indeed, in mid-2010, a bleak but accurate gloss on &quot;strategic reassurance&quot; might be that the only area of genuine mutual reassurance concerns China's willingness to sail around the Horn of Africa in a cautious and responsible manner in search of pirates. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The aggravated</span> US-China <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">relationship is compounded by the</span> Obama administration's diff<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">iculty in making compromises</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> At first, the administration's initiatives looked promising. They made no easy accommodation to habitual U.S. claims to national exceptionalism, and even had some international appeal. Indeed, they were designed to repudiate the arrogant American me-firstism that had seen the U.S. turn its back on the Kyoto climate treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the International Criminal Court, and the Law of the Sea Treaty. In short, rather than deploying the rhetoric of national interest, the Obama administration presented itself as a promoter of global norms—and sought to impose those norms on China. Yet the full brunt of U.S. intentions often only become clear in the foreign policy-making fine print, such as the somewhat obscure speeches of U.S. deputy secretaries. </span>As Steinberg put matters with respect to China: Now, strategic reassurance<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> does not only apply to the relationship between China and the United States. Our partners, particularly in Asia, must have the same certainty that China’s expanding role will not come at the expense of their interests. And this not only </span>requires that the United States bolster its own bilateral relationships, especially with key allies like<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Japan, </span>South Korea<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and Australia, but also that we lead in updating and strengthening the regional and international institutions that shape the context in which China’s development occurs, so that change is constructive rather than destabilizing. ... When it comes to the international system, we must ensure that new powers like China – and there are others as well, of course – can take their rightful place at the table without generating fear or mistrust. ... As we pursue these policies, we will be open to China’s growing role, but we will also be looking for signs and signals of reassurance from China. If China is going to take its rightful place, it must make those signals clear. So, when U.S. initiatives collided with Chinese interests, there was no graceful way to negotiate between Obama universalism and Chinese particularism or, as it is usually framed in the Western press, U.S. principle vs. Chinese selfishness. The situation has not been helped by the fact that many of the Obama administration's grand strategic initiatives have fizzled in practice (or in the case of something like economically crippling Iran through sanctions, the outcome may be years in the future). Complex Rubik's cube diplomacy involving interlocking initiatives and delicate sequencing on much tougher Iran sanctions, climate change, and nuclear non-proliferation have yielded few breakthroughs. The reasons are numerous, but in each case, China is part of the story. China has challenged the U.S. on a number of these issues. For example, Beijing earned the Obama administration's ire for its high-profile role in opposing U.S. initiatives in the Copenhagen climate debacle and as a result of its hard bargaining on UN sanctions against Iran. Partly as a result of Chinese resistance, the climate and NPT treaties and Iran sanctions have, after immense expenditures of prestige and energy by the United States, degenerated into little more than unproductive can-kicking down the road of futile multilateral initiatives. In short, strategic reassurance is not forthcoming in areas of potential cooperation, a situation that the Obama administration blames on China, and not on any shortcomings of its own policies. Frictions, on the other hand, are persistent and apparently structural. It appears that, in response, the Obama administration has chosen to interpret “strategic reassurance” as the simple and emotionally satisfying strategy of rollback—attacking Chinese interests instead of trying to accommodate them. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">From the Chinese perspective, the Obama</span> administration’s China <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">policy</span> increasingly <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">looks</span>, walks, and quacks <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">like containment</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Apparently, the United States prefers a different term: “preempting China’s monopoly status”. On his blog, the Washington Note, foreign policy insider Steve Clemons reported on a conversation he had in early June with senior administration officials involved in the international realm. One of the most interesting comments made to a question I posed probing the administration's strategy in Asia, was &quot;Steve, don't watch the hand!&quot; What this person was saying was 'don't get lost in everything going on at the surface' in US-China relations or US-Japan relations, but rather look at the other many bits and pieces of America's engagement in the Asia Pacific that are enhancing US leverage and generating a greater sense among Pacific Rim countries that America is there, engaged, and preempting China from enjoying monopoly status.

<u>The evolution of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Sino-U.S. relations</span> over the next</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> months, </span><u>years</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and decades </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">has the potential to have a greater impact on global security</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and prosperity than any other bilateral or multilateral arrangement. In this sense, many analysts consider the US.-China diplomatic relationship to be the most influential in the world. Without question, strong and stable U.S. alliances provide the foundation for the protection and promotion of U.S. and global interests. Yet within that broad framework, the trajectory of </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">U.S.-China relations will determine the success</span>, or failure, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">of efforts to address the toughest global challenges:</span> global <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">financial stability, energy security and climate change, nonproliferation, and terrorism</span>, among other pressing issues.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Shepherding that trajectory in the most constructive direction possible must therefore be a priority for Washington and Beijing. </span><u>Virtually <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">no major global challenge can be met without U.S.-China cooperation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The uncertainty of that future trajectory and the &quot;strategic mistrust&quot; between leaders in Washington and Beijing necessarily concerns many experts and policymakers in both countries. Although some U.S. analysts see China as a strategic competitor—deliberately vying with the United States for energy resources, military superiority, and international political influence alike— analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has generally found that China uses its soft power to pursue its own, largely economic, international agenda primarily to achieve its domestic objectives of economic growth and social stability.1 Although Beijing certainly has an eye on Washington, not all of its actions are undertaken as a counterpoint to the United States. In addition, CSIS research suggests that growing Chinese soft power in developing countries may have influenced recent U.S. decisions to engage more actively and reinvest in soft-power tools that have atrophied during the past decade. To the extent that there exists a competition between the United States and China, therefore, it may be mobilizing both countries to strengthen their ability to solve global problems. To be sure, U.S. and Chinese policy decisions toward the respective other power will be determined in large part by the choices that leaders make about their own nations interests at home and overseas, which in turn are shaped by their respective domestic contexts. Both parties must recognize—and accept—that the other will pursue a foreign policy approach that is in its own national interest. Yet, in a globalized world, challenges are increasingly transnational, and so too must be their solutions. As demonstrated by the rapid spread of SARS from China in 2003, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">pandemic flu can be spread rapidly</span> through air</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and via international travel. Dust particulates from Asia settle in Lake Tahoe. An economic downturn in one country can and does trigger an economic slowdown in another. </span><u>These challenges can no longer be addressed by</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> either </span><u>containment</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or isolation. What constitutes the national interest today necessarily encompasses a broader and more complex set of considerations than it did in the past As a general principle, the United States seeks to promote its national interest while it simultaneously pursues what the CSIS Commission on Smart Power called in its November 2007 report the &quot;global good.&quot;3 This approach is not always practical or achievable, of course. But neither is it pure benevolence. Instead, a strategic pursuit of the global good accrues concrete benefits for the United States (and others) in the form of building confidence, legitimacy, and political influence in key countries and regions around the world in ways that enable the United States to better confront global and transnational challenges. In short, the global good comprises those things that all people and governments want but have traditionally not been able to attain in the absence of U.S. leadership. Despite historical, cultural, and political differences between the United States and China, Beijing's newfound ability, owing to its recent economic successes, to contribute to the global good is a matter for common ground between the two countries. Today there is increasing recognition that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">no</span> major global <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">challenge can be</span> addressed effectively, much less <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">resolved, without</span> the active engagement of—and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">cooperation between—the United States and China</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The United States and China—the worlds first- and third-largest economies—are inextricably linked,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a fact made ever more evident in the midst of the current global financial crisis. Weak demand in both the United States and China, previously the twin engines of global growth, has contributed to the global economic downturn and threatens to ignite simmering trade tensions between the two countries. Nowhere is the interconnectedness of the United States and China more clear than in international finance. China has $2 trillion worth of largely U.S. dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves and is the world's largest holder—by far—of U.S. government debt. Former treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson and others have suggested that the structural imbalances created by this dynamic fueled the current economic crisis. Yet. China will almost certainly be called on to purchase the lion's share of new U.S. debt instruments issued in connection with the U.S. stimulus and recovery package. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's February 23.2009, reassurance to Beijing that U.S. markets remain safe and her call for continued Chinese investment in the U.S. bond market as a means to help both countries, and the world, emerge from global recession underscored the shared interest—and central role—that both countries have in turning around the global economy quickly. Although China's considerable holdings of U.S. debt have been seen as a troubling problem, they are now being perceived as a necessary part of a global solution. Similarly, as the worlds two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and the United States share not only the collateral damage of energy-inefficient economic growth, but a primary responsibility to shape any ultimate global solutions to climate change. To date, cooperation has been elusive, owing as much to Washington's reluctance as to Beijing's intransigence. Painting China as the environmental bogeyman as an excuse for foot-dragging in policymaking is no longer an option; for its part, China, as the world's top polluter, must cease playing the developing-economy card. Yet energy security and climate change remain an area of genuine opportunity for joint achievement. Indeed, U.S.-China cooperation in this field is a sine qua non of any response to the energy and climate challenges. The sheer size of the Chinese economy means that collaboration with the United States could set the de facto global standards for etficiency and emissions in key economic sectors such as industry and transportation. Climate change also provides an area for cooperation in previously uncharted policy waters, as in emerging Arctic navigational and energy exploration opportunities. Washington and Beijing also share a deep and urgent interest in international peace and stability. The resumption of U.S.-China military contacts is a positive development. As two nuclear powers with worldwide economic and strategic interests, both countries want to minimize instability and enhance maritime security, as seen by parallel antipiracy missions in the waters otT Somalia. Joint efforts in support of United Nations peacekeeping, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism offer critical areas for bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Certainly, regional and global security institutions such as the Six-Party Talks concerning North Korea or the UN Security Council require the active engagement of both Washington and Beijing. Even more broadly, crisis management in geographic regions of mutual strategic interest like the Korean peninsula, Iran, or Burma require much more Sino-U.S. communication if the two countries are to avoid miscalculation and maximize opportunities to minimize human sutfering. Increasing the number of mid-level military-to-military exchanges would help in this regard. The United States and China could do more to cooperate on law enforcement to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Western China. Afghanistan is competing with Burma as the main provider of narcotics to China; Washington could use its influence with the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul to develop a joint antinarcotics program. This could potentially build networks and joint capabilities that might be useful for U.S.-China cooperation on the issue of Pakistan. In addition, Washington should also encourage NATO-China cooperation along the Afghan border. Collaborating under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) might provide an additional framework for Beijing and Washington to address Central Asian security issues in a cooperative manner. 1he SCO, which includes Pakistan as an observer and will convene a multinational conference on Afghanistan in March 2009, has long made curbing narcoterrorism in Afghanistan a priority. In addition, the VS. Drug Enforcement Agency and the Chinese Anti-Narcotics Bureau should expand cooperation on interdiction and prosecution of heroin and meth traffickers. To be sure, there are a number of areas of serious divergence between Washington and Beijing. This should surprise no one. The United States has disagreements with even its allies. Two large powers with vastly dilferent histories, cultures, and political systems are bound to have challenges. History has shown, however, that the most effective way of addressing issues is for the U.S. and Chinese governments to engage in quiet diplomacy rather than public recrimination. In the U.S.-China context, there is often little to be gained—and much to be lost in terms of trust and respect—by a polarizing debate. Any differences, moreover, must not necessarily impede Sino-U.S. cooperation when both sides share strong mutual interests. I;. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that &quot;the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.&quot;3 Effective policy toward China by the United States, and vice versa, will require this kind of dual-minded intelligence. Moreover, working together on areas of mutual and global interest will help promote strategic trust between China and the United States, facilitating possible cooperation in other areas. Even limited cooperation on specific areas will help construct additional mechanisms for bilateral communication on issues of irreconcilable disagreement. In fact, many of the toughest challenges in U.S.-China relations in recent years have been the result of unforeseen events, such as the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999 and the EP-3 reconnaissance plane collision in April 2001. Building trust and finding workable solutions to tough problems is the premise behind the Obama administrations foreign policy of smart power, as articulated by Secretary of State Clinton. Smart power is based on, as Secretary Clinton outlined in her confirmation hearing, the fundamental belief that 'We must use... the full range of tools at our disposal—diplomatic, economic, military, political and cultural—picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each situation.&quot;' As the CS1S Commission on Smart Power noted in November 2007, &quot;Smart Power is neither hard nor soft—it is the skillful combination of bothIt is an approach that underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships and institutions at all levels... .°5 As such, smart power necessarily mandates a major investment in a U.S.-China partnership on key issues. 'The concept enjoys broad support among the Chinese and American people and, by promoting the global good, it reaps concrete results around the world. There should be no expectation that Washington and Beijing will or should agree on all, or even most, questions. But the American and Chinese people should expect their leaders </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to come together</span> on those vital issues that require their cooperation. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">U.S.-China partnership</span>, though not inevitable, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is indispensable</span></u>. <br />

This position gives them significant leverage over the US and substantially undermines our ability to negotiate with them when they side against us, as they seem to be doing now.

<strong>Chinese Currency Conflicts cause a slippery slope to protectionism and trade war</strong><br />

<br />
<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">U.S. lawmakers are taking direct aim at China's economic policies,</span> endorsing legislation that would allow companies to seek retribution for lost sales <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">due to undervalued currencies</span> such as the yuan.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The House of Representatives voted 348-79 Wednesday to amend the 1930 Tariff Act to make clear that &quot;fundamental exchange-rate misalignment&quot; is a punishable subsidy under American trade law. The change, if enacted, would require the U.S. Trade Representative to consider complaints of harm due to foreign currency policies, opening the door to countervailing import duties. China isn't mentioned in the bill, but the target of the measure's authors is clear. As lawmakers considered the legislation at committee last week, the debate was all about China, which politicians, unions and some companies have long accused of benefiting from the active management of its exchange rate at the expense of lost American jobs. Estimates suggest the yuan is undervalued relative to the dollar by anywhere from 5 to 40 per cent. </span><u>With midterm elections little more than a month away,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the country's unemployment rate stuck above 9.5 per cent two years after the financial crisis, </span><u>some political show of force against China was all but inevitable</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;We want China to know that we're all standing shoulder-to-shoulder for fair trade,&quot; Pennsylvania Republican Tim Murphy, the bill's co-sponsor, told Bloomberg Television before the vote. The China measure has a long way to go before becoming law. The Senate and the president also would have to approve it, and it's unclear whether either would do so. Still, </span><u>the vote represents a shift in the politics that surround China's economic policies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For all the vitriol spilled on China's currency practices in recent years, </span><u>the House until Wednesday had stopped short of endorsing a legislative remedy directed at Beijing's policy of keeping the yuan pegged at an advantageous rate against the dollar</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Politicians may well be bluffing - many said during the debate that their goal is to give Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner a &quot;stick&quot; to help in negotiations with the Chinese. But </span><u>the fact <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that there now is legislation on the table necessarily increases the risk of a trade war between the world's two largest economies. It also threatens to set a precedent for other countries that have issues with the currency policies</span> of China and other countries.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;It is important to keep the pressure on China to re-align its currency, but if countries start trying to countervail on the basis of exchange rates, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">we could be on a pretty slippery and dangerous slope in terms of respect for the integrity of WTO rules</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; said Lawrence Herman, a trade lawyer at Cassels Brock in Toronto. </span><br />

<strong>Trade wars cause global war</strong><br />

<strong>Spicer, Olin Foundation, 96</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(The Challenge from the East and the Rebirth of the West, p. 121) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The choice facing the West today is much the same as that which faced the Soviet bloc after World War II: between meeting head-on the challenge of world trade with the adjustments and the benefits that it will bring, or of attempting to shut out markets that are growing and where a dynamic new pace is being set for innovative production. The problem about the second approach is not simply that it won’t hold: satellite technology alone will ensure that consumers will begin to demand those goods that the East is able to provide most cheaply. More fundamentally, it will guarantee the emergence of a fragmented world in which natural fears will be fanned and inflamed. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">A world divided into</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">rigid</span> <u><span style="text-underline: thick;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">trade blocs will be a deeply troubled and unstable place</span> in <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">which</span> suspicion and ultimately envy <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">will possibly erupt into a major war</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I do not say that the converse will necessarily be true, that in a free trading world there will be an absence of all strife. Such a proposition would manifestly be absurd.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nowhere are the representational dimensions of politics, and our mimetic attempts to conceal them, more evident than in the domain of television perhaps the most crucial source of collective consciousness today. </span><u>Abstractions about war are intertwined with <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">representational practices</span> that are</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> increasingly </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">shaped by the</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> dictates of the </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">entertainment</span>-oriented <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">media industry</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<strong>Aesthetics creates a new framework for debate—rather than seeking better answers about the resolution, we should ask better questions about Korea and search for “uncoveries” that give us new insight—our form of puzzle-based research uniquely opens up new possibilities and points of view.</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Taking on certain political challenges does not mean that the outcome of the research is pre-given, or that the respective arguments are 'formulaic and predictable'.20 Allow me to illustrate this issue with reference to a research project that took up several years of my time and passion; an investigation into transnational and transversal practices of dissent. I became interested in this topic because I witnessed, in 1987, how massive street demonstrations toppled one of Asia's most authoritarian regimes, that of General Chun Doo-hwan in South Korea. I was fascinated by the power that popular dissent could unleash, by how seemingly powerless people managed to dismantle, in a largely non-violent manner, a regime that was armed to its teeth. Being part of this process mesmerised me. I became obsessed with the need to find out more about it. I embarked on extensive historical and empirical research, but after several years of work I reached conclusions that contradicted just about every assumption (and passion) I started off with. I had to concede that </span><u>street demonstrations were often far less powerful than their spectacular appearance suggested, that some of their heroic and masculine features did in fact entrench many value-based practices of domination</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Detailed scrutiny of transformative processes revealed that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">seemingly mundane </span>daily <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">forms of resistance</span> can often <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have a</span> far more <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">potent effect</span> in the long run</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I also realised that </span><u>literature provides key insight into these inaudible political spheres</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">- that, </span><u>indeed, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">literature </span>itself <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">can be </span>an important means of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">political transformation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 21 The advantages of problem-based research Some of the concerns that Holden rightly raises, such as bias in research design or the problematic nature of interdisciplinary forays, can be met successfully by conceptualising research not as method- or theory-driven, but as revolving around problems or puzzles. Ian Shapiro is probably the most prominent author who has advocated such an approach. He laments that much political science research has taken on the form of internal disciplinary discussions, as if theorists themselves were the proper objects of study. Rather than structuring research around existing theoretical and methodological debates, Shapiro thus urges scholars to engage 'the great questions of the day'. 22 One can challenge various aspects of Shapiro's suggestions, such as his call for theorists to serve as 'roving ombudsmen for the truth', or his implied juxtaposition of 'normative' and 'empirically informed' research. But critique is not my task here, for in its most basic form the principle of problem-driven research is convincing. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">A scholar would </span>thus <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">start by identifying a fundamental political puzzle</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as, for instance, the persistence of malnutrition and hunger despite the fact that the world could, at least in principle, produce enough food to nourish its entire people. </span><u>The next step would consist of identifying key research questions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that could serve to focus and structure the project. </span><u>Only then is it possible to think about which methodologies are best suited</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to approach, understand and perhaps solve the problem. It is self-evident that different puzzles require different methodologies. </span><u>In some cases social science methods</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as statistics, game theory or structured interviews, </span><u>may be the most useful</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and appropriate means of research. </span><u>In other cases</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span><u>a range of alternative tools, such as historical or literary analyses, may yield more insights into the puzzle and the research questions it has generated</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Various advantages emerge from puzzle-driven research. Since one is no longer obliged to rehearse existing disciplinary debates before engaging problems in the 'real' world, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a scholar may be more successful in escaping the narrow conception of remembering and forgetting that international relations conventions have imposed</span> for decades</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Cynthia Enloe, for instance, has produced innovative research through such attempts to sidestep academic conventions. She interprets the dynamics of world politics not from the vantage point of existing scholarly debates, but by listening to voices of, say, women migrant workers in Mexico or prostitutes in brothels outside US military bases in Asia. By rethinking the international from the margins, Enloe allows us to see relations of power in a completely different way.23 </span><u>If a puzzle is the main research challenge, then it can be addressed with all means available, independently of their provenance or label</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A source may stem from this or that discipline, it may be academically sanctioned or not, expressed in prose or poetic form, language-based or visual or musical or take any other shape or form: it is legitimate as long as it helps to illuminate the puzzle in question. Puzzle-based research allows a scholar to venture into various disciplinary realms, including literature, without getting lost in 'the great unread' that Holden recognises as problematic: the inevitable mass of literary texts and commentaries that can never be read by a single person.24 The same principle does, of course, hold true for political engagements with all aspects of art. If I want to explore how Picasso's famous canvass Guemica has influenced or illuminated attitudes to war, I do not necessarily need to know everything about art history, or even about Picasso's paintings. I must have an idea of the methodologies proper to art historical studies, but I can gain important insight through a study of Guemica without engaging detailed discussions on, say, the significance of Picasso's Blue Period or the gendered representation of his numerous lovers. As a scholar of international relations I can take from the field of literature whatever I need, without either having to address all disciplinary debates in literary theory or basing this' appropriation' on purely personal and arbitrary grounds. Needless to say, such a foray into art is not without both aesthetic and political controversy. Art is, of course, far more than a means, a method or a tool.

<strong>The negative will tell you that their arguments are empirical and objective and that aesthetics are subjective, but they ignore that all theories are aesthetic because they engage in a process of abstraction from a specific history and point of view–we need to recognize this to open up space for new insight</strong><br />

We then frame it and hang it on a wall, usually next to other pictures that aesthetically resemble it. We arrange them all in an exhibition and display them to the public. In this manner we have all admired 'blockbuster' exhibitions of realist and liberal masterpieces of world politics. Some of us may have visited the occasional smaller exhibit of, say, feminist and postmodern sketches of the international. Or perhaps we have stumbled upon an opening of a new postcolonial gallery, or caught the occasional glimpse of a radical experimental installation. Such aesthetic adventures do not tend to be very popular with a public used to figurative eye-pleasers. </span><u>The most admired paintings remain the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> old masterpieces: the </span><u>massive and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">heroic realist canvases</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Indeed, we love them so much that we have embarked on extensive and costly attempts to restore the gargantuan Thucydides and Machiavelli frescos that adorn the Intellectual temples of our discipline. Some parts of the original paintings were faded, damaged or at times effaced altogether. Fortunately, though, the skilful restoring experts interpreted the missing brush strokes confidently and repainted them with gusto.

<u>From its original conception as the reproduction of reality</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> through dance, ritual, theater, image, and writing, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">mimesis has thrived as an aesthetic concept</span>, capturing the perceptual and representational powers of mimicry, imitation, and metaphor.</u> <u>The</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> linguistic </span><u>roots</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of mimesis </span><u>go back to fifth century Greece, to mimos</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>whose</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> many </span><u>derivatives convey a dramatic act of representation through imitation.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> At the outset, mimesis attracted philosophical criticism, as one would expect from any powerful form of representation that created whole imaginary worlds, that made one thing into some thing other, even if it was done through symbolic actions. </span><u>We know</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> best </span><u>the figure of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the 'mime'</span> -one who depicts life ‘as it is'</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>but with a satirical twist: he or she <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">'fools' humans</span></strong>.</u> <u>As imitation mimesis emerged as a fundamental force in human development.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In a highly condensed, almost poetic fashion, Walter Benjamin presented his case in the 1933 essay On the Mimetic Faculty,&quot; Language, play, mystery and violence are evinced as mimetic manifestations. Nature creates similarities. One need only think of mimicry. The highest capacity for producing similarities, however, is man's. His gift of seeing resemblances is nothing other than a rudiment of the powerful compulsion in former time to become and behave like some thing else. Perhaps there is none of his higher functions in which his mimetic faculty does not play a decisive role.&quot; This character of </span><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">mimesis</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, ranging in effects from theatrical artifice to political deception, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">came under renewed scrutiny</span> in the period <strong>between the I and II World Wars <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">when modes of violence took an aesthetic turn</span>.</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Walter Benjamin, acutely aware that new technologies were changing the nature of politics and that social-cultural-ethical theory was not keeping pace said, &quot;One may say that </span><u>the harshest, most disastrous aspects of imperialist war are the result of the gaping discrepancy between the gigantic power of technology and the minuscule moral illumination it affords</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; </span><u>This was most apparent in the marrying of new technologies of killing with</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> new technologies of </span><u>representation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; radio, film and the popular press. In his highly influential essay, 'The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility,' Walter Benjamin warns of </span><u>the evolution of warfare into an art form. War was becoming the deadliest exhibition of art</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in which self-alienated humans &quot;enjoy their own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the highest order&quot;. </span><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This is the aesthetics that the politics of fascism manufactures</span>.</u></strong> <u>This form of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">realism is dangerous in that it purports to be realistic, yet takes no account of differing realities</span>, whether they are culturally, historically or virtually produced <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and runs the risk of propagating</span> unintended and potentially <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">dangerous consequences</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> &quot;</span><u>The genuine liberation from an epoch that has the structure of awakening is entirely ruled by wisdom. Only with wisdom can we work free of the realm of dreams.</u> <u>There is a false liberation from dreams; its sign is violence.&quot;</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Walter Benjamin wrote, &quot;</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">A ‘social problem'</span> such as an influx of refugees <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">can escalate into a ‘security issue' and a whole group of people can become a ‘problem' leading to violent <strong>final solutions</strong></span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">These dreams</span>, described as reality, have become a shortcut to the <strong>banality that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">starts wars</span></strong>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> No longer do these dreams reveal an eternally blue horizon.&quot; Literary theorist Rene Girard looked at mimesis in an anthropological light and investigated how </span><u>every desire is desire for that which the ‘other' also desires, which, unmediated, inevitably leads to hatred, rivalry and violence</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Walter Benjamin's and Rene Girard's study of mimesis gives considerable philosophical depth to the idea that </span><u>we are prepped for war from an early age.</u> <u>We are left with all-too-real effects of virtual violence: <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">representations can kill</span>.</strong></u><br />

<strong>Realism claims to mimic the real world, which makes violence, anarchy, and the state seem natural—only by viewing realism as an aesthetic narrative can we expose these as fictions</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nietzsche and Derrida offer a penetrating critique of sovereignty, yet. . . it lives, most demonstrably in international theory and diplomatic statecraft, as, no less, the realist perspective. What do we mean by &quot;realism&quot;? It encompasses a worldview in which sovereign states, struggling for power under conditions of anarchy, do what they must to maintain and promote their own self-interests. </span><u>But what do &quot;we&quot; mean by &quot;realism&quot;?</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We realists, constituted by and representing disciplinary schools of thought, diplomatic corps, intelligence bureaucracies, depict things as they really are, rather than as idealists might wish them to be. And what do &quot;we&quot; mean by &quot;realism&quot;? </span><u>We mean what we say and say what we mean, in that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">transparent</span> way of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">correspondence</span> that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">provides </span>the veridical, commonsensical, deadly discourses of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">realism, as &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot; assures our security, or &quot;we had to destroy the village in order to save it</span>.&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But with the end of the Cold War, and pace Nietzsche, why beat a dead horse? Precisely </span><u>because <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">realism does death so well, by refusing to acknowledge</span> not only i<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">ts ongoing complicity in the death of others</span> but also the fact that it gave up the ghost a long time ago. How many times</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, after how many &quot;revolutionary&quot; transitions, </span><u>have we heard that sovereignty is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at bay, at an end, </span><u>dead?</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There is always the easy deflection, that sovereignty is an &quot;essentially contested concept,&quot; a &quot;convenient fiction,&quot; that changes with the times. But </span><u>the frequency of such death notices</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, from politicians, military strategists and pundits, as well as academicians, </span><u>leads one to suspect that something other than funerary oration, philosophical speculation, or a topic for a special issue is at work. Is there a darker, even gothic side to the sovereign state, a hidden power that resides in its recurrent morbidity?</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Take a look at some of the principal necroses. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Realism has built a life out of the transformation of fictions, such as the immutability of human nature and the</span> apodictic <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">threat of anarchy, into fact</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. With a little digging, realism comes to resemble nothing so much as the undead, a perverse mimesis of the living other, haunting international politics through the objectification of power, the immutability of human nature and the apodictic threat of anarchy, into fact. With a little digging, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">realism comes to resemble nothing so much as the undead, a perverse mimesis of the living other, haunting international politics through the objectification of power, the festishizing of weaponry, the idealization of the state, the virtualization of violence</span> and the globalization of new media</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Now </span><u>the fact of realism's own death lives on as a powerful fiction</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as the morbid customs, characteristics and habits of the living dead. If this sounds more like Stephen King than Nietzsche or Derrida, so be it. </span><u>Not that he or they would claim to put an end to realism</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—as if that were possible—</span><u>but rather, to render it more responsible for reproducing a world it claims only to record</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Nietzsche recognizes the allure of realism by citing some exemplars in history: My recreation, my preference, my cure from all Platonism has always been Thucydides. Thucydides and, perhaps, Machiavelli's Principe are most closely related to myself by the unconditional will not to gull oneself and to see reason in reality—not in &quot;reason,&quot; still less in &quot;morality.&quot; .. . One must turn him over line by line and read his hidden thoughts. Sophist culture, by which I mean realist culture, attains in him its perfect expression ... Courage in face of reality ultimately distinguishes such natures as Thucydides and Plato: Plato is a coward in face of reality—consequently he flees into the ideal; Thucydides has himself under control—consequently he retains control over things.12 </span><u>Self-control as the antidote for the will—born out of resentment and fear—to control the other: This is not a bad place to begin when reality is spectralized by virtuality. It might help to explain the obduracy of realism as we increasingly interact with a mimetic world that seems to be in the control of virtual &quot;things&quot; that imitate reality</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (such as opinion polls, worst-case scenarios, Sky TV, Microsoft, Disney, Inc.). In the realm of international theory, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this means realism</span> once again &quot;<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">flees into the ideal</span>,&quot; this time, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">of</span> a &quot;democratic peace&quot; underwritten by an ever-enlarging <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">neoliberal global order</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Plato to NATO might seem to be an ontological stretch, but to this jaded eye </span><u>the enlargement of the neoliberal order resembles nothing so much as a platonic, utility-maximizing Blob, an ideal-formlessness absorbing all who come into contact with the prepolitical protoplasm of market forces and security imperatives</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It takes more than the courage of the Sophists </span><u>to face the seemingly inexorable forces of virtual realities, telecast in the functionalist, utilitarian and rationalist language of the neoliberal order</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Perhaps Nietzsche is right: </span><u>It takes a virtuous, even poetic, willfulness</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, like Machiavelli's, </span><u>to confront the reality principle of realism, sovereignty and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its ultimate ratio, </span><u>war. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Realism's </span>long, intimate <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">history with violence</span>, whether <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in the guise of impartial observer </span>or amoral reproducer, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">requires that</span> if we are to have anything meaningful to say to realism, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">we</span> too <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">must get up close to the virtual technologies of representation</span>, preparation and execution of war</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Cultural studies has shown a reluctance to enter into proximity talks with violence. </span><u>This is one more reason to begin an extradisciplinary, intersubjective, ethical inquiry into the mimetic relationship of realism to organized violence, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">beginning with</span> but not stopping at <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the state violence of political realism, the class violence of social realism, the global violence of nuclear realism, the techno violence of hyperrealism</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Again, as Nietzsche shows us, it is better to embrace than beat an old horse. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It’s not all that simple,' Paul Celan is said to have responded, when asked about his seeming lack of political engagement in the spring of 1968.1 </span><u>Oppression</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for him, </span><u>was deeply entrenched in social customs and language. A more just and inclusive political order could not be ushered in overnight, especially</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not </span><u>through a violent outburst of rage</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and rebellious energy. Waves of rising fists, Hooding the streets of Paris, seemed visually and acoustically too reminiscent of a recent and rather grim chapter in German history, one that Celan had experienced personally. Not that he was indifferent to the voicing of dissent. His </span><u>poetry was all about the search for thinking space</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Yet, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">he located revolutionary potential</span> not in heroic upheavals, but in slow and inaudible processes, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in the gradual transformation of societal values. <strong>Political resistance</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for Celan, </span><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is apolitical</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Instead of getting entangled in the agitation that permeates heated political manoeuvrings, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">dissent must deal with the forces that have</span> already <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">framed the issue</span>, circumvented the range of discussions, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and</span> thus <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">pre-empted </span>fundamental public <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">debates</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the domain of social science, poetry is often considered a mere ode to the beauty of life. This chapter adds to the overall objective of this book: to demonstrate that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">students of world politics ought to take poetry seriously</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and this even when, or rather, </span><u>precisely <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">when poems do not seem to carry an overtly political message</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. More so than perhaps any other poet, Celan demonstrates that </span><u>poems that seem to carry no explicit political message at all can</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in fact, </span><u>be political in the most profound sense of the term: <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">they interfere with how we speak and write about the world, and thus how we constitute the</span> very <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">foundation of political life</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Celan's poetry radically interferes with the very linguistic foundations of politics, and thus deserves to be examined seriously and systematically. This is not to say that Celan has easy solutions to political challenges, or that he can solve, once and for all, the problem of domination. His poem merely highlights what is at stake in the interaction between language and politics. </span><u>Because poetry is self-conscious about the usage of language, it is able to shed light on processes through which all practices of speaking and writing can engender a gradual transformation of societal values. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Poetry demonstrates how it is possible to reveal</span> the grey shades of domination and resistance, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">how social change can emerge from questioning linguistically entrenched ideas</span>, assumptions <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and</span> social <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">practices that have been placed beyond scrutiny</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The political vacuum that had existed after half a century of Japanese occupation may have provided an environment that facilitated the imposition of dualistic and antagonistic Cold War identity patterns. This does, of course, not mean that there had been no differences in Korea, or that ideology has eradicated all other sources of identity. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Regional identities</span> have always <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">play</span>ed <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a key role in politics on the peninsula</span>, both before and after the Korean War</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, Koreans derive their identity from a variety of sources. Depending on the situation, a person may, for instance, be identi.ed primarily as a man or a woman, an elder or a youth, a manager or a peasant.1 These and many other forms of identi.cation are carefully grammaticized in the Korean language, which possesses verb and noun suf.xes that structurally force a speaker to identify speci.c hierarchy relationships in all verbal interactions. </span><u>The Cold War has not eradicated these aspects of Korean culture and politics.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Rather, it has created a situation where one very speci.c, and largely externally imposed form of identi.cation – an ideological one – has come to prevail over all others. Whereas gender, age, education or regional af.liation continue to be key factors in determining a person’s social status and possibilities, his/her ideological identi.cation has literally turned into a matter of life and death, or at least freedom and imprisonment. It is in this context that the rivalry between the two Koreas has given rise to a highly volatile conict zone. </span><u>The Korean War claimed the lives of more than a million people and, almost half a century after the events, an estimated 10 million individuals are still separated from their families</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Perhaps even more tragic, as Bruce Cumings (1997: 298) notes, is not even the war itself, for it could have solved – as many civil wars do – some of the political tensions that existed in Korea during the 1940s and early 1950s – tensions that were unusually high and linked to such issues as colonial legacies, foreign intervention and national division. </span><u>The true tragedy, Cumings stresses, was ‘<strong>that the war solved nothing’</strong>, for all it did was to restore the status quo ante</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.2 </span><u>The stage was now set for a volatile future.</u> <u>Each of the subsequent <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">attempts to repress</span> the Korean <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">conflict through</span> the conventional logic of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">military deterrence has turned out to be disastrous</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">They have</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in Moon Chung-in’s words (1996: 9), ‘</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">driven North and South Korea into</span> the trapping structure of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a vicious cycle</span> of actions and reactions’</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The peninsula</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as a result, </span><u>was sucked into a very costly arms race that elevated levels of tensions to the point that the two divided sides have almost constantly been exposed to the spectre of violence</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Examples abound: </span><u>North Korea has committed what are said to be a dozen major terrorist attacks</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, from bombings of civilian airliners to tunnel and submarine in.ltrations across the DMZ. </span><u>South Korea stands accused of having violated the Armistice Agreement roughly 500,000 times</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Moon 1996: 53). Its yearly joint military exercises with the US Army, entitled Team Spirit, have traditionally revolved around an unnecessarily aggressive northbound military scenario (Moon 1996: 68</span><u>). The <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">identity patterns</span> that formed with the <strong>division of the peninsula and the subsequent Korean War <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are important for understanding the challenges that lie ahead. Antagonistic identity constructs</span>,</strong> born out of death, fear and longing for revenge<strong>, are continuously used to fuel and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">legitimize aggressive</span> foreign and repressive domestic <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">policies</span>.</strong> Identity in Korea is essentially constructed in negative terms</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; that is, </span><u>in direct opposition to the other side of the divided nation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What Cumings (1997: 140) wrote of the immediate post-war period remained valid for all of the post-war period, at least until very recently: not one good thing could be said about the leader on the other side of the dividing line. ‘To do so was to get a jail sentence.’ Look at a few examples of what Moon (1996: 71–2) calls ‘demonising images’. </span><u>The North Korean press is full of derogative terms that describe the South Korean political system and its leaders</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The concepts have changed over the years, but the dynamic remains the same. In the mid-1980s, for instance, the terminology used to describe South Korean presidents included honori.c attributes such as ‘human butcher’, ‘rare human rubbish’, ‘chieftain of irregularities and corruption and human scum’ (KCNA, Jan./Feb. 1988). In more recent times, the preferred vocabulary has shifted towards terms like ‘warhawks’, ‘warmongers’, ‘fascists’, ‘imperialists’ and ‘reactionaries’ (KCNA, April/ May 2000). </span><u>In South Korea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> too, </span><u>negative identity constructs became entrenched in societal consciousness to the point that ‘for more than two decades after national partition, South Korean schoolchildren visually depicted North Koreans literally to be red-bodied demons with horns and long fingernails on their hairy, grabbing hands, as represented in anti- Communist posters’</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Choi 1993: 81). </span><u>One does not need to be a trained psychologist to realize that children who grow up with such images and educational leitmotifs contribute to the dissemination of a societal selfawareness that is articulated through a stark opposition between inside and outside.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Efforts have recently been made to dismantle at least some of these antagonistic images. Of.cers of the South Korean Armed Forces, for instance, are encouraged to introduce and employ military jargon that allows soldiers to distinguish between the evil North Korean system (the ‘main enemy’) and their innocent brothers and sisters in the north (the ‘anti-enemy’) (Defence White Paper 1998: 83). But </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">deeply entrenched antagonistic identity constructs cannot be changed overnight</span>. They persist in virtually all aspects of life.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">‘In front of them all’ proclaims the muchheralded motto of the US and South Korean troops stationed in the Joint Security Area (Eighth US Army 2000). Perhaps even more telling is the fact that President Kim Dae-jung created a major political storm when he described Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, not in the usual negative terms (as a brutal, insane, licentious and impetuous drunk and playboy), but as ‘a pragmatic leader with good judgement and knowledge’ (see Korea Herald, 8 May 2000). </span><u>The vehemence of the public reaction demonstrates that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the construction of an antagonistic ‘other’ is</span> so pronounced and deeply <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">embedded in </span>the collective <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">consciousness</span> that, as several Korean commentators now admit, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it is</span> virtually <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">impossible to advance objective assessments of</span> the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">security</span> situation <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">on the peninsula</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Choi 1998: 26). </span><br />

The <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">memory of violence and death continues to dominate politics on the peninsula</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For the last half century the Korean peninsula has been divided between a communist North and a capitalist South, each viewing the other as its ideological archrival. On each side </span><u>an unusually strong state</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> emerged and </span><u>was able to promote <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a particular ideological vision</span> of politics and society</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: a vision </span><u>that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">constructs the other side</span> of the dividing line <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">as an enemy and a source of fear and instability</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A passionate anti-capitalist attitude dominates the reclusive North while a more moderate but still pronounced anti-communist orientation prevails in the South. One of the most striking features of politics in Korea is the almost total state control over cross-border relations. Travel, mail and telecommunication links between North and South have been entirely cut off. For the past half century </span><u>the Demilitarised Zone has perhaps been the world's most hermetically sealed border</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the case of North Korea, state control over civil society is particularly pronounced. One could, indeed, speak of an annihilation of civil society. Oh Kongdan and Ralph Hassig stress that North Korea is 'the most closed society on earth', and that it has been more successful than any other modern government in cutting off its people from the outside world. 59 Average citizens have no access to foreign television programmes, radio broadcasts or newspapers. The country's official and only media is completely controlled by the state and geared towards one objective: the mythological legitimisation of the state and its leaders. In the context of a hermetically divided peninsula, where there is virtually no communication and information passing from one side to the other, </span><u>each state could easily promote propagandistic regime-legitimisation processes without running the risk of having its truth claims questioned by the population. Much has</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of course, </span><u>changed with the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> collapse of the Soviet Union and the </span><u>global dissolution of a Cold War power structure. <strong>But not so in Korea</strong>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The peninsula is still divided</span>, caught <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in a</span> tense and highly anachronistic <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Cold War stalemate</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

John <strong>Mearsheimer 2001 (</strong>John, Co-Director of IR Policy @ Univ. of Chicago, <u>The Tragedy of Great Power Politics</u>, pg. 32-33)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Great powers fear each other, They regard each other with suspicion, and they worry that war might be in the offing. They anticipate danger. </span><u>There is little room for trust among states.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For sure, the level of fear varies across time and space, but it cannot be reduced </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">to</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a trivial level. </span><u>From the perspective of <span style="background-color: yellow;">any</span></u> <u>one great <span style="background-color: yellow;">power, all other</span> great powers <span style="background-color: yellow;">are potential enemies</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This point is illustrated by the reaction of the United Kingdom and France to German reunification at </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">the end of the Cold War. Despite the fact that these three states had been close allies for almost forty-five years, both the United Kingdom and France immediately began worrying about the potential dangers of a united Germany.'° </span><u>The basis of this fear is that in a world where great powers have the capability to attack each other and might have the motive to do so<span style="background-color: yellow;">, any state bent on survival must be at least suspicious of other states and reluctant to trust them</span>. Add to this the &quot;911&quot; problem-the absence of a central authority to which a threatened state can turn for help-and states have even greater incentive to fear each other. Moreover<span style="background-color: yellow;">, there is no mechanism, other than the possible self-interest of third parties, for punishing an aggressor</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Because it is sometimes difficult to deter potential aggressors, states have ample reason not to trust other states and to be prepared for war with them. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The</span> possible <span style="background-color: yellow;">consequences of</span> falling victim to <span style="background-color: yellow;">aggression further amplify</span> the importance of <span style="background-color: yellow;">fear</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as a motivating force in world politics. Great pow- ers do not compete with each other as if international politics were merely an economic marketplace. </span><u>Political competition among states is a much more dangerous business than mere economic intercourse; the former can lead to war, and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> war often means </span><u>mass killing</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on the battlefield as well as mass murder of civilians. In extreme cases, war can even lead to the destruction of states. The horrible consequences of war sometimes cause states to view each other not just as competitors, but as potentially deadly enemies. </span><u>Political antagonism,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in short, </span><u>tends to be intense, because the stakes are great. <span style="background-color: yellow;">States</span> in the international system</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">also </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">aim to guarantee their own survival</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Because other states are potential threats, and because there is no higher authority to come to their rescue when they dial 911, states can- not depend on others for their own security<span style="background-color: yellow;">. </span></span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Each state tends to see itself as vulnerable and alone</span>,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and therefore it aims to provide for its own survival. In international politics, God helps those who help themselves. This emphasis on self-help does not preclude states from forming alliances.&quot; But alliances are only temporary marriages of convenience: today's affiance partner might be tomorrow's enemy, and today's enemy might be tomorrow's alliance partner. For example, the United States fought with China and the Soviet Union against Germany and Japan in World War H, but soon thereafter flip-flopped enemies and partners and allied with West Germany and Japan against China and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">States operating in a self-help world</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> almost always </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">act according to</span> their own <span style="background-color: yellow;">sell-interest</span> and do not subordinate their interests to the interests of other states</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or to the interests of the so-called international com- munity. The reason is simple: it pays to be selfish </span><u>in a self-help world</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is true in the short term as weli as in the long term, because if a state loses in the short run, it might not be around for the long haul. Apprehensive about the ultimate intentions of other states, and aware that they operate in a self-help system, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">states</span> quickly <span style="background-color: yellow;">understand</span> that <span style="background-color: yellow;">the best way to ensure</span> their <span style="background-color: yellow;">survival is to</span> be the most <span style="background-color: yellow;">powerful</span> state in the system<span style="background-color: yellow;">. The stronger a state is relative to its potential rivals, the less likely it is that any of those rivals will attack it and threaten its survival</span>. Weaker states will be reluctant to pick fights with more powerful states because the weaker states are likely to suffer military defea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">t. Indeed, the bigger the gap in power between any two states, the less likely it is that the weaker will attack the stronger. Neither Canada nor Mexico, for example, would countenance attacking the United States, which is far more powerful than its neighbors. The ideal situation is to be the hegemon in the system. As Immanuel Kant said, &quot;It is the desire of every state, or of its ruler, to arrive at a condition of perpetual peace by conquering the whole world, if that were possible.&quot;12 Survival would then be almost guaranteed.&quot; Consequently, states pay close attention to how power is distributed among them, and they make a special effort to maximize their share of world power. Specifically, they look for opportunities to alter the balance of power by acquiring additional increments of power at the expense of potential rivals. States employ a variety of means-economic, diplomatic, and military-to shift the balance of power in their favor, even if doing so makes other states suspicious or even hostile</span><u>. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Because one state's gain in power is another state's loss, great powers tend to have a zero-sum mentality when dealing with each other.</span> The trick, of course, is to be the winner in this competition and to dominate the other states in the system. Thus, the claim that states maximize relative power is tantamount to arguing that <span style="background-color: yellow;">states</span> are disposed to <span style="background-color: yellow;">think offensively toward other states, even though their ultimate motive is simply to survive</span>. In short, <span style="background-color: yellow;">great powers have aggressive intentions</span>.'4</u><br />

<strong>B. The aff is a rejection of realism—this only results in more fascistic discourses</strong><br />
<br />
John <strong>Mearsheimer, 1995</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>Prof of Political Science at Univ of Chicago<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [</span><u>International Security</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Summer, p.82-83 </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The most revealing aspect of Wendt’s discussion is that he did not respond to the two main charges leveled against critical theory in “False Promise.” </span><u>The first problem with <span style="background-color: yellow;">critical theory</span> is that</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> although the theory is deeply concerned with radically changing state behavior, </span><u>it <span style="background-color: yellow;">says little about how change comes</span> about. The theory <span style="background-color: yellow;">does not tell us why particular discourses become dominant</span>,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and others fall by the wayside. Specifically, Wendt does not explain why realism has been the dominant discourse in world politics for well over a thousand years, although I explicitly raised this question in “False Promise” (p.42) Moreover, </span><u>he <span style="background-color: yellow;">sheds no light on why the time is ripe for unseating realism, nor</span> on <span style="background-color: yellow;">why realism is likely to be replaced by a more peaceful, communitarian discourse</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, although I explicitly raised both questions. Wendt’s failure to answer these questions has important ramification for his own arguments. Fore example, he maintains that if it is possible to change international political discourse and alter state behavior, ‘then it is irresponsible to pursue policies that perpetuate destructive old orders [i.e. realism] especially if we care about the well-being of future generation.” The clear implication here is that realists like me are irresponsible and do not care much about the welfare of future generations. However, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">even </span>if we change discourses and move <span style="background-color: yellow;">beyond realism</span>,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a fundamental problem with Wendt’s argument remains</span><u>: because his <span style="background-color: yellow;">theory cannot predict </span>the future, he <span style="background-color: yellow;">cannot know whether</span> the discourse that ultimately replaces realism will be more benign than realism. He has no way of knowing whether <span style="background-color: yellow;">a fascistic discourse more violent than realism will emerge</span> as the hegemonic discourse</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, he obviously would like another Gorbachev to come to power in Russia, be he cannot be sure we will not get a Zhirinovsky instead</span><u>. So even from a critical theory perspective, defending realism might very well be the more responsible policy choice</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<br />
<u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The possible consequences of falling victim to aggression further amplify the importance of fear as a motivating force in world politics</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Great powers do not compete with each other as if international politics were merely an economic marketplace. </span><u>Political <span style="background-color: yellow;">competition among state</span>s is a much more dangerous business than mere economic intercourse; the former can read to war, and war <span style="background-color: yellow;">often means mass killing</span> on the battlefield as well</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a5 </span><u>mass murder of civilians.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In extreme cases, </span><u>war can <span style="background-color: yellow;">even</span> lead to <span style="background-color: yellow;">the destruction of states</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The horrible consequences of war sometimes cause states to view each other not just as competitors, but as potentially deadly enemies. Political antagonism, in short, tends to be intense, because the stakes are great. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">States</span> in the international system also <span style="background-color: yellow;">aim to guarantee their own survival.</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;"> Because</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> other states are potential threats, and </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">because there is no higher authority</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to come to their rescue when they dial 911, states can’ t just depend on others for their own security. Each state tends to see itself as vulnerable and alone, and therefore it aims to provide for its own survival<span style="background-color: yellow;">. </span></span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">In international politics, </span></u><strong><u>God helps those who help themselves</u></strong><u>.</u> This emphasis on self-help does not preclude states from forming alliances.” But alliances are only temporary marriages of convenience: today’s alliance partner might be tomorrow’s enemy, and today’s enemy might be tomorrow’s alliance partner. For example, the United States fought with China and the Soviet Union against Germany and Japan in World War II, but soon thereafter flip-flopped enemies and partners and allied with West Germany and Japan against China and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.<br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">For the realist, then, if rationalist theories prove so conservative as to make their adoption problematic, critical theories prove so progressive as to make their adoption unattractive. If the former can justifiably be criticised for seeking to make a far from ideal order work more efficiently, thus perpetuating its existence and legitimating its errors,</span> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">reflectivist theory can</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> equally </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">be criticised for searching for a tomorrow which </span></u></span><strong><u>may never exist</u></strong><u>, thereby <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">endangering</span></strong><span style="background-color: yellow;"> the possibility of</span> establishing any form of <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">stable order</span></strong><span style="background-color: yellow;"> in the </span><strong>here and now</strong>. Realism's</u> distinctive <u>contribution</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> thus lies in its attempt to drive a path between the two, a path which, in the process, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">suggests</span> the basis on which some form of</u> <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;"><u>synthesis</u></span></strong> <u>between rationalism and reflectivism</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> might be achieved. Oriented in its genesis towards addressing the shortcomings in an idealist transformatory project, </span><u>it is centrally motivated</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by a concern to reconcile vision with practicality, </span><u>to</u> <strong><u>relate utopia and reality.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Unifying a technical and a practical stance, it combines aspects of the positivist methodology employed by problem-solving theory with the interpretative stance adopted by critical theory, avoiding the monism of perspective which leads to the self-destructive conflict between the two. Ultimately, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">it can</span></u> <strong><u>simultaneously</u></strong> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">acknowledge</span> the <strong>possibility of <span style="background-color: yellow;">change</span></strong> in the structure of the international system and the need to <strong>probe the limits of the possible</strong>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">and</span> yet also <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">question the proximity</span></strong><span style="background-color: yellow;"> of</span> any international <span style="background-color: yellow;">transformation</span>, emphasise the <strong>persistence of problems</strong> after such a transformation, and serve as a <strong>reminder</strong> of the need to grasp whatever <strong>semblance of order</strong> can be obtained in the <strong>mean time.</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Indeed, it is possible to say that realism is uniquely suited to serve as such an orientation. Simultaneously to critique contemporary resolutions of the problem of political authority as unsatisfactory and yet to support them as an attainable measure of order in an unstable world involves one in a contradiction which is difficult to accept. Yet, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">because it grasps the </span></u><strong><u>essential ambiguity</u></strong> <u>of the political, and adopts imperfectionism as its dominant motif, realism can relate these <span style="background-color: yellow;">two tasks in a way which allows </span><strong>neither to predominate</strong>, achieving</u> , if not a reconciliation, then at least <u>a</u> <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;"><u>viable synthesis</u></span><u>.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Perhaps the most famous realist refrain is that </span><strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">all politics are power politics</span>.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is the all that is important here. Realism lays claim to a relevance across systems, and because it relies on a conception of human nature, rather than a historically specific structure of world politics, it can make good on this claim. If its observations about human nature are even remotely accurate, the problems that it addresses will transcend contingent formulations of the problem of political order. </span><u>Even in a genuine cosmopolis</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, conflict might become technical, but </span><u>it</u> <strong><u>would not be eliminated</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">altogether. The primary manifestations of </span><u>power might become more economic or institutional</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> rather than (para)military, but, where disagreements occur and power exists, the employment of the one to ensure the satisfactory resolution of the other is inevitable short of a wholesale transformation of human behaviour. </span><u>Power is ultimately of the essence of politics; it is not something which can be banished, only</u> <strong><u>tamed and restrained.</u></strong> As a result, <u>realism achieves a universal relevance to the problem of political action which allows it to relate the</u> <strong><u>reformist zeal</u></strong> <u>of critical theory, without which advance would be impossible, with the problem-solver's <strong>sensible caution</strong> that, before reform is attempted, whatever measure of <strong>security</strong> is possible under contemporary conditions must first be ensured.</u><br />

<u>Although most military personnel do not violate women, this is an officially recognized problem in U.S. military families, for women in the military, and in communities</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> near bases in this country and overseas.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Discursive Construction of China as Other in the &quot;China Threat&quot; Literature Having examined how the &quot;China threat&quot; literature is enabled by and serves the purpose of a particular U.S. self-construction, I want to turn now to the issue of how </span><u>this <span style="background-color: yellow;">literature represents a discursive construction of other</span>, instead of an &quot;objective&quot; account of Chinese reality. This, I argue, has less to do with its portrayal of China as a threat per se than with its <span style="background-color: yellow;">essentialization and totalization of China as an externally knowable object, independent of historically contingent contexts or dynamic international interactions</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In this sense, </span><u>the discursive construction of China as a threatening other cannot be detached from (neo)realism,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a positivist, a historical framework of analysis within which global life is reduced to endless interstate rivalry for power and survival. As many critical IR scholars have noted, </span><u>(neo)<span style="background-color: yellow;">realism is not a transcendent description of global reality but is predicated on the modernist Western identity</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which, in the quest for scientific certainty, has come to define itself essentially as the sovereign territorial nation-state. </span><u>This realist self-identity of Western states leads to the constitution of anarchy as the sphere of insecurity, disorder, and war</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In an anarchical system, as (neo)realists argue, &quot;the gain of one side is often considered to be the loss of the other,&quot; (45) and &quot;All other states are potential threats.&quot; (46) In order to survive in such a system, states inevitably pursue power or capability. In doing so, </span><u>these realist claims represent what R. B. J. Walker calls &quot;a specific historical articulation of relations of universality/particularity and self/Other.&quot; (47)</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The (neo)realist paradigm has dominated the U.S. IR discipline in general and the U.S. China studies field in particular. As Kurt Campbell notes, after the end of the Cold War, a whole new crop of China experts &quot;are much more likely to have a background in strategic studies or international relations than China itself.&quot; (48) </span><u>As a result, <span style="background-color: yellow;">for</span> those <span style="background-color: yellow;">experts to know China is nothing more</span> or less <span style="background-color: yellow;">than to</span> undertake a geopolitical analysis of it, often by <span style="background-color: yellow;">ask</span>ing only a few questions such as <span style="background-color: yellow;">how China will &quot;behave</span>&quot; in a strategic sense <span style="background-color: yellow;">and how it may affect </span>the regional or <span style="background-color: yellow;">global balance of power</span>, with a particular emphasis on China's military power or capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Thomas J. Christensen notes, &quot;Although many have focused on intentions as well as capabilities, the most prevalent component of the [China threat] debate is the assessment of China's overall future military power compared with that of the United States and other East Asian regional powers.&quot; (49) </span><u>Consequently, almost by default, <span style="background-color: yellow;">China emerges as an absolute other and a threat thanks to</span> this (neo)<span style="background-color: yellow;">realist prism</span>.</u><br />

<br />
<u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The discursive construction of the U.S. self and the &quot;Chinese threat</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; argument are not innocent, descriptive accounts of some &quot;independent&quot; reality. Rather, they </span><u>are always a clarion <span style="background-color: yellow;">call for the practice of power politics</span>. At the apex of this power-politics agenda is the politico-strategic question of &quot;what is to be done&quot; to make the United States secure from the (perceived) threats it faces.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> At a general level, as Benjamin Schwarz proposes, </span><u>this <span style="background-color: yellow;">requires an unhindered path to</span> U.S. global hegemony that means not only <span style="background-color: yellow;">that the United States</span> must <span style="background-color: yellow;">dominate wealthy and technologically sophisticated states</span> in Europe and <span style="background-color: yellow;">East Asia</span>-</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">- America's &quot;allies&quot;--but also that it must deal with such nuisances as Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic and Kim Jong Il, </span><u>so that potential great powers need not acquire the means to deal with those problems themselves</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And </span><u>those powers that eschew American supervision--such as <span style="background-color: yellow;">China--must be both engaged and contained</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The upshot of &quot;American leadership&quot; is that the United States must spend nearly as much on national security as the rest of the world combined. (67) </span><u>This &quot;neocontainment&quot; policy has been echoed in the &quot;China threat&quot; literature.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In a short yet decisive article titled &quot;Why We Must Contain China,&quot; Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer insists that &quot;containing China&quot; and &quot;undermining its ruthless dictatorship&quot; constitute two essential components of &quot;any rational policy toward a rising, threatening China.&quot; Not only is a policy other than containment considered irrational, but even a delay to implement it would be undesirable, as he urges that &quot;containment of such a bully must begin early in its career.&quot; To this end, Krauthammer offers such &quot;practical&quot; options as strengthening regional alliances (with Vietnam, India, and Russia, as well as Japan) to box in China; standing by Chinese dissidents; denying Beijing the right to host the Olympics; and keeping China from joining the World Trade Organization on the terms it desires. (68) Containing China is of course not the only option arising from the &quot;China threat&quot; literature. </span><u>More often than not, there is a subtle, business-style &quot;crisis management&quot; policy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, Bernstein and Munro shy away from the word containment, preferring to call their China policy management. (69) </span><u>Yet, <span style="background-color: yellow;">what remains unchanged in the management formula is a continued promotion of controlling China</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For instance, a perusal of Bernstein and Munro's texts reveals that what they mean by management is no different than Krauthammer's explicit containment stance. (70) </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">By framing U.S.-China relations as an issue of &quot;crisis management,&quot; they leave little doubt of who is the &quot;manager&quot; and who is to be &quot;managed.&quot;</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In a more straightforward manner, Betts and Christensen state that </span><u>coercion and war must be part and parcel of the China management policy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: In addressing the China challenge, the United States needs to think hard about three related questions: first, how to avoid crises and war through prudent, coercive diplomacy; second, how to manage crises and fight a war if the avoidance effort fails; third, how to end crises and terminate war at costs acceptable to the United States and its allies. (71) This is not to imply that the kind of perspectives outlined above will automatically be translated into actual China policy, but one does not have to be exceedingly perceptive to note that </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the &quot;China threat&quot; perspective</span></u> <u>does exert <span style="background-color: yellow;">enormous influence on U.S. policy making on China</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> To illustrate this point, I want now to examine some specific implications of U.S. representations of the &quot;China threat&quot; for U.S.-China relations in relation to the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis and the &quot;spy plane&quot; incident of 2001. Theory as Practice 1: The Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis In the eyes of many U.S. China watchers, China's approach to the Taiwan question is a microcosm of its grand strategy to dominate Asia. The argument is that nowhere is the threatening ambition more palpable than in China's saber-rattling missile tests near Taiwan's coast in 1995-1996, in addition to its long-standing refusal to renounce the use of force as a last resort to settle the dispute. (72) While the 1995-1996 missile crisis has </span><u>been a favorite &quot;starting point&quot; for many pundits and practitioners to paint a frightening picture of China and to <span style="background-color: yellow;">justify U.S. firm response to it</span>, what is often conveniently overlooked is the question of how the &quot;China threat&quot; discourse itself had played a constitutive role in the lead-up to that crisis</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Limits of space forbid exploring this complex issue here. Simply put, </span><u>the Taiwan question was created largely as a result of widespread U.S. perceptions of China as a &quot;Red Menace&quot; in the wake of the &quot;loss of China&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the outbreak of the Korean War. To thwart what it saw as an orchestrated Communist offensive in Asia, the United States deployed the U.S. Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait as part of its Cold War containment strategy, thereby effectively preventing the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. While the United States abandoned its containment and isolation policy toward China in the 1970s and the two countries established full diplomatic relations in 1979, the conventional image of the &quot;Red Menace&quot; lingered on in the United States. To manage such a &quot;threat,&quot; the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act shortly after the normalization of U.S.-China relations, renewing U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense even though diplomatic ties with the island had been severed.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">I have argued above that </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the &quot;China threat</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; argument in mainstream U.S. IR literature </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">is derived</span></u><u>, primarily, <span style="background-color: yellow;">from a discursive construction of otherness</span>. This construction is <span style="background-color: yellow;">predicated on a particular narcissistic understanding of the U.S. self and on a positivist-based realism</span>, concerned with absolute certainty and security, a concern central to the dominant U.S. self-imaginary</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Within these frameworks, it seems imperative that China be treated as a threatening</span></u><u>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">absolute other</span> since it is unable to fit neatly into the U.S.-led evolutionary scheme</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or guarantee absolute security for the United States, so that U.S. power preponderance in the post-Cold War world can still be legitimated. Not only does </span><u>this</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> reductionist representation come at the expense of understanding China as a dynamic, multifaceted country but it </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">leads inevitably to a policy of containment that</span></u><u>, in turn, tends to <span style="background-color: yellow;">enhance</span> the influence of realpolitik thinking, <span style="background-color: yellow;">nationalist extremism, and hard-line stance in today's China</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even a small dose of the containment strategy is likely to have a highly dramatic impact on U.S.-China relations, as the 1995-1996 missile crisis and the 2001 spy-plane incident have vividly attested. In this respect, Chalmers Johnson is right when he suggests that &quot;a policy of containment toward China implies the possibility of war, just as it did during the Cold War vis-a-vis the former Soviet Union. The balance of terror prevented war between the United States and the Soviet Union, but this may not work in the case of China.&quot; (93) For instance, as the United States presses ahead with a missile-defence shield to &quot;guarantee&quot; its invulnerability from rather unlikely sources of missile attacks, it would be almost certain to intensify China's sense of vulnerability and compel it to expand its current small nuclear arsenal so as to maintain the efficiency of its limited deterrence. In consequence, it is not impossible that the two countries, and possibly the whole region, might be dragged into an escalating arms race that would eventually make war more likely. Neither the United States nor China is likely to be keen on fighting the other. But as has been demonstrated, the &quot;China threat&quot; argument, for all its alleged desire for peace and security, tends to make war preparedness the most &quot;realistic&quot; option for both sides. At this juncture, worthy of note is an interesting comment made by Charlie Neuhauser, a leading CIA China specialist, on the Vietnam War, a war fought by the United States to contain the then-Communist &quot;other.&quot; Neuhauser says, &quot;Nobody wants it. We don't want it, Ho Chi Minh doesn't want it; it's simply a question of annoying the other side.&quot; (94) And, as we know, in an unwanted war some fifty-eight thousand young people from the United States and an estimated two million Vietnamese men, women, and children lost their lives. Therefore, </span><u>to call for a halt to the vicious circle of theory as practice associated with the &quot;China threat&quot; literature</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, tinkering with the current positivist-dominated U.S. IR scholarship on China is no longer adequate. Rather</span><u>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">what is needed is to question this un-self-reflective scholarship itself, particularly its connections with the dominant way in which the United States</span> and the West in general <span style="background-color: yellow;">represent themselves</span> and others via their positivist epistemology, <span style="background-color: yellow;">so that alternative, more nuanced, and less dangerous ways of interpreting and debating China might become possible.</span></u><br />

<strong>Public debate is the Key forum to challenge Realist constructions of China – public communication is “Overheard,” which can alter how China understands the US and how we understand them. This must extend beyond political officials to include debate by the public.</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Schultz’s (1998) model of domestic opposition introduces a more active role for political parties, but still restricts their role to supporting or to opposing the government’s foreign policy. For Schultz, </span><u>‘it is crucial that parties compete in public. Open political debate means that foreign states can ‘‘overhear’’ the policy statements used to build electoral support’</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (1998: 832). The key intuition, then, is </span><u>that <span style="background-color: yellow;">as domestic public debate increases, it becomes more difficult for states to conceal or to misrepresent their preferences</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and the more difficult for a leader to back away from a publicly declared policy. Schultz provides a crucial step in the logic of communicative engagement, but his rationalist assumptions about communication remain insufficient to account for communicative action</span><u>. In the audience</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> costs </span><u>model, the only role for the public is to sanction or constrain governments</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in their pursuit of predefined preferences. This offers no room for </span><u>the <span style="background-color: yellow;">reasoned critique</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the audience to </span><u>actually <span style="background-color: yellow;">affect the understanding of state interests held by policy makers</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In this model there is no real exchange of argument about the interests of the state, the nature of the strategic situation, the relative value of different potential payoffs or the appropriate course of action. </span><u>The <span style="background-color: yellow;">experience of US–China engagement</span>, however, <span style="background-color: yellow;">reveals</span> substantive <span style="background-color: yellow;">discourses over precisely these issues</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The intense American political struggle over granting China Normal Trade Relations involved considerable self- interested bargaining, but it also reflected real uncertainty about the nature of the strategic relationship and real arguments over the definition of collective interests. </span><u>Americans disagreed about the threats and opportunities posed by China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the likely impact of each American policy decision on China’s future policies, and the overall American national interest. Public sphere debates explicitly weighed human rights against economic interest, weapons proliferation against cooperation on regional security, an interest in Chinese economic growth against the dangers of rising Chinese power. In other words<span style="background-color: yellow;">, </span></span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">this public debate openly contested </span></u><u>precisely the preferences and <span style="background-color: yellow;">expectations which rationalist theory takes as given.</span> These substantive public debates about the nature <span style="background-color: yellow;">and</span> record of engagement, with deep disagreement reflecting real conceptual and political differences, <span style="background-color: yellow;">formed an integral part of the communicative process</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A similar debate inside China about the nature of the opportunities and threats in the changing international order has been carried out quietly inside government and military institutions (Deng and Wang, 1999; P. Saunders, 2000a). A model in which a domestic audience punishes leaders who back down from their public positions fails to capture the complexity of these communicative acts in the public sphere. Weighing the audience costs models against </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">a communicative action approach to the public sphere</span></u> <u>therefore <span style="background-color: yellow;">produces very different conceptions of the </span></u><strong><u>role</u></strong> <u>of communication in strategic relationships</u> (Calhoun, 1993; Elster, 1998; Bohman and Rehg, 1999). Rationalist models conceptualize deliberation as cheap talk within strategic bargaining which might help to solve coordination games but not cooperation games. The public matters primarily as an exogenous constraint on the pursuit of fixed interests by state leaders. The introduction of audience costs shows that it makes a difference whether negotiations are carried out in public or are kept hidden from public view (Elster, 1995). Private diplomacy, outside the scrutiny of the media and of public opinion, follows the dynamics of strategic bargaining. Where bargaining is carried out before public scrutiny, the nature of the constraints shifts, as actors must provide compelling reasons for their positions. Communicative approaches to deliberation go beyond this conception of the public as an exogenous constraint. <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Public dialogue</span></u> <u>within overlapping national and international public spheres does more than simply provide information about preferences; it <span style="background-color: yellow;">allows interested actors and expert observers to contest truth claims and interest claims</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Prior to Tiananmen, for example, American and Chinese leaders concentrated almost exclusively on high-level diplomacy, with little public participation or serious public debate. After the crackdown, however, American public opinion and Congress forced public justification of China policy. In this context of publicity, the focus shifted from strategic relations to public argumentation over what role China’s human rights practices should play in calculations of American interests (Nathan and Ross, 1997, Ch. 12; Mann, 1999). The publicity which lies at the heart of communicative engagement requires arguments and reasons which could in principle be accepted by both sides. Consistent with constructivist approaches in IR, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">state preferences are not fixed</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, subject only to constraints imposed by either an audience or domestic opposition<span style="background-color: yellow;">, </span></span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">but rather are constructed through the exchange of reasoned argument in the public sphere</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Haacke, 1996; Rustin, 1999; Lynch, 2000; Payne, 2000). </span><u>While primarily carried out by government officials</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and experts, </span><u>public dialogue would be addressed to a universal audience and open to effective scrutiny by the citizens of both states</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this conception of publicity, arguments which would be convincing only to a national audience are in this context ‘private’, no matter how fiercely contested in the domestic political arena (Bohman, 1996: 39). Direct dialogues among private citizens form a supportive layer which allows domestic publics to more effectively challenge and critique government justifications for policy (Bohman, 1998, 1999; Archibugi et al., 1999).4 While communicative engagement initially involves primarily government officials, supplemented by ‘track two’ exchanges of semi-official experts, the communicative encounter will ideally expand to encompass the publics of both sides in order to establish a common lifeworld across societies. This is not necessary at the stage of weak communicative action which characterizes engagement, however.</span><br />

<strong>No Senkakus conflict now—US deterrence role</strong><br />

<u>A growing number of territorial disputes between China and its neighbors has fed concerns that Beijing has abandoned its &quot;peaceful rise&quot; for a more aggressive stance. The incidents range from a September <span style="background-color: yellow;">altercation between a Chinese fishing boat and a Japanese Coast Guard ship near the</span> disputed <span style="background-color: yellow;">Senkaku Islands</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to Chinese activities in the South China Sea and dam building on the upper Mekong. Four CFR experts answer the question: How should Washington respond to China's new assertiveness in its near abroad? Elizabeth Economy says </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the United States has shown </span>proper <span style="background-color: yellow;">resolve and will need to </span>consistently <span style="background-color: yellow;">back its allies to ensure security in the</span> South and <span style="background-color: yellow;">East China seas</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Sheila Smith, writing from Tokyo, says the United States and Japan should convey to Beijing a &quot;strong sense of common strategic purpose.&quot; Joshua Kurlantzick says Washington should let Southeast Asian states take the lead on territorial matters because of their added leverage with China and because that could limit direct U.S.-Chinese confrontations. Also important, says Scott Snyder, is for Washington to be prepared to cooperate with China in areas of mutual interest, such as reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula. Elizabeth Economy, CFR C.V. Starr Senior Fellow and Director for Asia Studies Chalk one up for the United States. The take-away from the recent diplomatic fracas in the South China Sea is that Washington finally has its China strategy about right: Stand up for U.S. interests, work with America's allies or partners, and continue to engage with Beijing. In that order. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have asserted the United States' commitment to freedom of navigation and to establishing rules of the road for maritime safety. They worked with others in the region to bring pressure to bear on China. And now they're engaging with Beijing. Just last week, China's General Liang Guanglie extended an invitation to Gates to visit Beijing early next year, thereby resuming the senior-most military-to-military relations that Beijing had frozen since late January. Such a well-considered and executed policy is far from simple. It required a level of resolve that the United States has not often demonstrated in its relations with China. </span><u>And now, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the United States will have to maintain </span>that same <span style="background-color: yellow;">consistency in order to bring about </span>real <span style="background-color: yellow;">security in the</span> South--and <span style="background-color: yellow;">East--China Seas</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The United States needs to hold China accountable for each and every violation of collision regulations or law of the sea infractions. Chinese assertiveness in the region is not new. Territorial disputes--sometimes escalating into violence--have been ongoing for decades between China and other claimants, such as Vietnam and the Philippines. The United States has had its own run-ins with Chinese naval and fishing vessels. Until now, however, the U.S. response has been inconsistent--sometimes raising Chinese infractions publicly while other times largely ignoring them. This does not send the right message. The United States needs to hold China accountable for each and every violation of collision regulations or law of the sea infractions. Only by publicly documenting a pattern of behavior will the United States and its allies be able to keep China at the table for serious discussions that will enable a real resolution of the disputes. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">China is on notice that it won't be able to steamroll its way through the</span> South and <span style="background-color: yellow;">East China seas</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And Washington has taken an important step toward reassuring countries in the Asia Pacific that they can still rely upon the United States. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Just because the Chinese have taken a step back this time</span>, however, <span style="background-color: yellow;">doesn't mean they won't try again. It's up to the United States to let them know that it will be there too</span>, again and again.</u><br />

The larger issue is how the United States and Japan view these missions and their respective roles in carrying them out. China </span><u>China has made huge strides in increasing its military power, which worries Japan.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">China has invested heavily in developing its own blue water navy as well as weapons systems such as its anti-carrier missile, the Dong Feng 21D, that challenge the alliance’s regional military supremacy. The lack of transparency that has accompanied China’s military advancement has worried both U.S. and Japanese policymakers.

<u>If such a clash occurred, it would pose a serious dilemma for the United States. <span style="background-color: yellow;">The U.S. commitment to defend Japan</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, enshrined in Article 5 of the Mutual Security Treaty, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">applies to “territories under the administration of Japan.” The Senkaku</span>/Diaoyu <span style="background-color: yellow;">Islands are under Japan’s administrative control</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even though Washington takes no position on which state (China or Japan) has sovereignty over them under international law.

<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Each defense budget takes so long to prepare that a defense secretary coming into office with a new president finds his hands all but tied: the Pentagon budgets for the next two years have already been laid down by his predecessor. But </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">Gates</span> was<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as he sometimes remarks, </span>his own predecessor<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. His two years under Bush meant that he will be only the second defense secretary—the first was Robert McNamara in the Kennedy/LBJ years—to have shaped all four defense budgets of a presidential term. In the first of his budgets under Obama, Gates took an ax to multiple big-ticket weapons systems; preparing his last, h</span>e has announced his intent to hack away at the bloated defense bureaucracies. That <span style="background-color: yellow;">battle—to slim down a defense establishment</span> far bigger than it was during the Cold War —<span style="background-color: yellow;">is going to consume </span></span><strong>every gram of political capital</strong> Gates has built up in Congress. Legislators, however much they say they support defense cuts in principle, <span style="background-color: yellow;">oppose them when their own constituents are affected. </span><strong>Gates will probably win</strong> the coming battles—he's won almost every skirmish so far—but he’ll emerge as damaged goods, and he knows it<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For that reason alone, it may be time to let Obama choose a new defense secretary who can smooth ruffled feelings on Capitol Hill, and to prepare for a second term if Obama wins one in 2012. </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">Quitting in 2011 will leave enough time to avoid</span> what would inevitably be <span style="background-color: yellow;">savagely partisan confirmation hearings</span> for Gates's successor in the preelection frenzy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<strong>Putting the Okinawa basing issue back on the agenda will sap Gates’ capital—he has to moderate rivalry between the Marines and the Air Force and deal with an unpredictable Congress</strong><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Unfortunately, </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">a shift in US policy on Okinawa can only happen</span> through intervention <span style="background-color: yellow;">at the Cabinet level</span>. There are simply too many powerful moving parts<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for a policy shift to be engineered by sub-cabinet officials. As things stand now, </span>the national security interagency process is heavily weighed down by Afghanistan and Iraq<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not to mention </span>Iran, China, North Korea, and a host of transnational issues. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Forcing </span></span><strong>Okinawa</strong>, and proper deployment of <span style="background-color: yellow;">the </span><strong>III Marine Expeditionary Force</strong> back on the policy agenda would require both <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">Gates</span></strong> and Clinton <span style="background-color: yellow;">doing some very “</span><strong>heavy lifting” politically</strong>. Rivalries between the US Marines and the Air Force would have to be tamed<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It will be very difficult for the Marines to streamline their presence on Okinawa without significant Air Force cooperation. Meanwhile, a </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">Congress</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> increasingly anxious to trim Pentagon budgets </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">would be an </span><strong>unpredictable factor</strong> in any effort to reopen the Marine-Okinawa issue. Congress has already strongly <span style="background-color: yellow;">signaled intent to slow down funding for the Guam buildup</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not so much because of political jockeying in Japan </span>but because of anger over faulty DOD estimates of infrastructure needs on Guam<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Texas </span>Senator<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Kay Bailey </span>Hutchinson<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee with considerable say on military construction issues, made some waves in Washington earlier this month when she </span>suggested that money earmarked for the buildup on Guam would be better spent in the continental US<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<strong>Defense cuts are necessary to fund Littoral Combat Ships—health care spending will overwhelm future weapons platforms without budget changes</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Part of </span><u>what Gates is doing is preemptive</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. His deepest fear is that budget politics will gut the military. “I’ve been very sensitive for a long time to the repeated pattern, during economic hard times or after a war, of the United States’ essentially unilaterally disarming,” he says. </span><u>To fund armed forces that</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for the most part, </span><u>he doesn’t want to shrink, and <span style="background-color: yellow;">to pay for future weapons platforms</span>—versatile ones <span style="background-color: yellow;">like the Littoral Combat Ship</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, revolutionary ones like drones—</span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Gates needs to slash $100 billion</span> or more <span style="background-color: yellow;">from the Pentagon’s overhead</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the next five years. (“Overhead” means all the infrastructure—people, bases, programs—that isn’t directly involved in combat.) Recently, he was in San Diego aboard a destroyer, the USS <em>Higgins,</em> when a sailor asked him where these savings would go. “If it works the way I want it to, you get the money,” Gates responded. He has done a deal with the White House. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Whatever the forces save in cuts</span> from their “tail,” <span style="background-color: yellow;">they can keep to spend on</span> their “teeth”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—the soldiers, sailors, and airmen who are on the front lines, in the air wings, and in </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the fleet</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. He thinks </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">he can persuade Congress to go along</span>. But he concedes that he faces some very tricky political issues</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Four-stars are not the only members of the military to enjoy costly perks. Leaving aside the costs of treating wounded warriors—Gates calls that “a sacred obligation”—</span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">health-care spending on the military</span> and their families <span style="background-color: yellow;">has doubled</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (in constant dollars) over the last decade. Yet the premiums that military families pay for coverage remain ridiculously low because Congress balks at raising them. (The fraction of the overall bills covered by premiums has dropped from 37 percent to 9 percent since 1999). Health-care costs, Gates says, are “eating the Defense Department alive.” But the issue is a political third rail. </span><u>Gates sees no option but to tackle tough issues if the U.S. military is to be preserved at anything close to its current size. “It is not a great mystery what needs to change,” he says. “What it takes is the political will and willingness</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—as Eisenhower had—</span><u>to make hard choices.” <span style="background-color: yellow;">Gates</span> will likely serve as defense secretary only for another year or so; he <span style="background-color: yellow;">seems determined to force those choices</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>Littoral Combat Ships are key to sea power—they project power ashore and control key theaters</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Clark, 2002</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – US Navy Admiral (Vern, “Sea Power 21,” October, <em>Proceedings</em>, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11354:http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/proceedings.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/proceedings.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/proceedings.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11354 -->) </span><br />
<br />
<u>Achieving <span style="background-color: yellow;">battle-space superiority in forward theaters is central</span> to the Sea Shield concept, especially as enemy area-denial efforts become more capable.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In times of rising tension, </span><u>pre-positioned <span style="background-color: yellow;">naval units will sustain access</span> for friendly forces and maritime trade by employing evolving expeditionary sensor grids and advanced deployable systems to locate and track enemy threats. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Speed will be an ally</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as linked sensors, high-speed platforms, and improved kill vehicles consolidate area control, including the location and neutralization of mines via state-of-the-art technology on dedicated mine warfare platforms and battle group combatants. Mission-reconfigurable </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Littoral Combat Ships</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, manned and unmanned aviation assets, and submarines with unmanned underwater vehicles </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">will gain and maintain the operational advantage</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while sea-based aircraft and missiles deliver air dominance. </span><u>The result will be combat-ready forces that are prepared to &quot;climb into the ring&quot; to achieve and sustain access <span style="background-color: yellow;">before and during crises</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Perhaps the most dramatic advancement promised by </span><u>Sea Shield will</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> be the ability of naval forces to </span><u>project defensive power deep overland, assuring friends and allies while protecting joint forces ashore</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A next-generation long-range surface-to-air Standard Missile, modernized E-2 Hawkeye radar, and Cooperative Engagement Capability will combine to extend sea-based cruise missile defense far inland. This will reinforce the impact of sea-based ballistic missile defense and greatly expand the coverage of naval area defense. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">These capabilities</span> represent a broadened mission for our Navy that will lessen the defensive burden on land forces and <span style="background-color: yellow;">increase sea-based influence over operations ashore. The importance of Sea Shield to our nation has never been greater, as</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">proliferation</span> of advanced weapons <span style="background-color: yellow;">and asymmetric</span> attack <span style="background-color: yellow;">techniques places</span> an increasing <span style="background-color: yellow;">premium on the value of deterrence and battlespace dominance</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Sea Shield capabilities, deployed forward, will help dissuade aggressors before the onset of conflict</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In addition, Sea Shield will complement Sea Strike efforts by freeing aviation forces previously devoted to force defense, allowing them to concentrate on strike missions and generate far greater offensive firepower from the fleet. In sum, </span><u>Sea Shield will enhance crisis control, protect allies and joint forces ashore, and set the stage for combat victory—providing a powerful new tool for joint combatant commanders in this dangerous age</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Where conflict threatens the global system and our national interests, maritime forces will be ready to respond alongside other elements of national and multi-national power, to give political leaders a range of options for deterrence, escalation and de-escalation. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Maritime forces</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that are persistently present and combat-ready provide the Nation’s primary forcible entry option in an era of declining access, even as they </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">provide the means </span>for this Nation <span style="background-color: yellow;">to respond quickly</span> to</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">other</span> <u>crises</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Win our Nation’s wars. In times of war, our ability to impose local sea control, overcome challenges to access, force entry, and project and sustain power ashore, makes our maritime forces an indispensable element of the joint or combined force. This expeditionary advantage must be maintained because it provides joint and combined force commanders with freedom of maneuver. Reinforced by a robust sealift capability that can concentrate and sustain forces, sea control and power projection enable extended campaigns ashore.</span><br />

<u>Only <span style="background-color: yellow;">a few months ago, the Japan-U.S. military alliance</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> — considered by both nations as the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region </span><u>— <span style="background-color: yellow;">was in crisis. But</span> owing to <span style="background-color: yellow;">a wakeup call in the East China Sea</span> — military tensions with Beijing — Japan is taking a fresh look at the role of the U.S. military in the country</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The tension with China <span style="background-color: yellow;">has led people in Japan to acknowledge the strategic importance of having U.S. forces based here,</span> not only for the defense of Japanese territory but also <span style="background-color: yellow;">to maintain stability throughout East Asia</span>. In the past month, Tokyo and Beijing waged a war of words over the Senkaku Islands</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">after Japan arrested a trawler captain near the uninhabited islets in the East China Sea. The islets are controlled by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan. Japan Coast Guard boats were trying to board the trawler, and it collided with them. Tokyo even saw what an economic war would look like, as Beijing apparently halted exports of rare earth minerals critical to Japan's high-tech industry. </span><u>China's fury over the sea incident eventually prompted Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to confirm that the Japan-U.S. security treaty applies to the Senkakus</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The treaty obliges the U.S. to defend Japan against an &quot;armed attack&quot; by another country. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Before the Senkaku crisis, Japan was having a hard time trying to sell the relocation of</span> U.S. Marine Corps Air Station <span style="background-color: yellow;">Futenma within Okinawa amid strong local opposition</span>. &quot;The crack between Japan and the U.S. had a major impact&quot; on China's decision-making, prompting it to take an aggressive attitude toward Japan, said Yoshimitsu Nishikawa, a professor of international relations at Toyo University. &quot;China was testing the U.S. and the Japanese government to see how far it can go.&quot; Indeed, <span style="background-color: yellow;">before the crisis, many people</span> at home and abroad <span style="background-color: yellow;">were questioning the</span> strength of the Tokyo-Washington military <span style="background-color: yellow;">alliance.</span> The relationship was suffering for the past year from the contentious Futenma airfield relocation in Okinawa,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> where antibase sentiment is strong, a fact not lost on politicians looking to score votes. But contrary to Beijing's hopes, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">many in Japan</span>'s leadership ranks <span style="background-color: yellow;">have felt compelled to reaffirm the strength of the</span> U.S. <span style="background-color: yellow;">alliance</span>, particularly <span style="background-color: yellow;">amid perceptions of China's growing military</span> strength</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and potential reach. Many leaders around Asia would agree. During a May 15 interview with the Asahi Shimbun, senior Singapore statesman Lee Kuan Yew emphasized the strategic importance of U.S. forces in Japan — in particular those in Okinawa — as a counterweight against China's growing military power. &quot;If you remove all bases of America, I think your position and that of Asia, that position will be weaker strategically,&quot; Lee said. &quot;And the Japanese people, never mind the government of the day, will have to decide where is their longer-term interest and which is more important — your security or your convenience of the Okinawa people?&quot;</span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ADT Contributions to the Region </span>Since 2008 and the implementation of the ADT program<span style="background-color: yellow;">, the ADTs are making a </span>sustainable<span style="background-color: yellow;"> positive difference across the region.</span> The <span style="background-color: yellow;">Afghan farmers are improving their</span> own <span style="background-color: yellow;">lives through</span> sustainable <span style="background-color: yellow;">non-opiate agricultural</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and it appears that the narcotic production in many provinces has dramatically decreased. In Nangarhar province </span>the United Nations has declared that <span style="background-color: yellow;">poppy production has been virtually eliminated.</span> ADTs have contributed to this positive trend. The successes of ADTs speak for themselves through the Afghan people. “<span style="background-color: yellow;">Tribal leaders in Afghanistan provinces are requesting additional teams</span>.”<span style="font-size: 8pt;">22 The role and makeup of </span>the ADT<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is nothing new to the National Guard. The Guard has traditionally participated with interagency partners at the State, Local, Federal levels and International levels. The Guard regularly participates in large-scale civil-military operations that involve multiple partners from the civilian sector during disaster mitigation or through our numerous partnerships in the State Partnership Program (SPP). This </span>demonstrates the importance of this effort of soft power in the COIN environment. The <span style="background-color: yellow;">ADTs are continuing to make inroads</span> by capacity building projects that will increase opportunities <span style="background-color: yellow;">and contribute to improving the lives of the people of Afghanistan by securing and stabilizing the country.</span> Additionally, the capability of these teams to reach back and leverage the universities, institutions, and <span style="background-color: yellow;">agricultural communities in the United States will only make partnerships stronger.</span> These professional partnerships will have a long lasting effect on the outcome and future of Afghanistan and will enable future generations the ability to sow the seeds of both sustained nourishment and peace. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Since its inception in 1993 the SPP program links states with partner countries for the purpose of supporting the security cooperation objectives of the Regional 15 Combatant Commanders. The mission allows using the unique civil-military nature of the Guard to interact with both active and reserve forces of foreign countries. The partners actively participate in a host of engagement activities from training exercises, civic leader visits and medical events. Developed countries around the world are interested in taking on this role and we should encourage them to utilizing their knowledge, skills and abilities in programs such as the ADT. Such “soft power” approaches will be more readily embraced by many nations uncomfortable or unwilling to enter into more kinetic operational alliances.</span> ADT Results <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The results </span>thus far are impressive. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Looking at the case study from Nangarhar Province, President George W. Bush in 2008 noted that: “The Nangarhar PRT and the Missouri National Guard </span>ADT have helped make Nangarhar one of the most stable and secure provinces in Afghanistan.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The ADT consisted of the Army National Guard and embedded civilian specialists. The specialists provided technical assistance and training to improve agriculture production, processing and marketing.”23 “The Nangarhar Provincial Reconstruction Team and National Guard ADT contributed the following results: • Approximately 100K Afghans have returned to the province. • In 2008, Nangarhar was declared poppy-free by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime – dropping from almost 20,000 opiated hectares (200K square miles in 2007). • All 22 districts in Nangarhar have all-weather paved roads connecting to the main highway. 16 • Nangarhar is now one of the most productive agricultural regions in Afghanistan, and the reconstruction team is looking to expand and improve on irrigation networks. • The PRT supports work on the road and bridge construction, school, governmental buildings, watershed management, and marketing infrastructure. • The Nangarhar PRT is providing micro-grants to small businesses and enabling them to re-open and expand restocking inventory, to restore business equipment, and to hire employees.”24 </span>These accomplishments are just one example of many where the ADT<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> coupled with the PRTs and interagency partnerships of other organizations </span>have made and continue to make a difference in the lives of the Afghan people. This aligns with the Obama Administration’s comprehensive strategy on governance at the national and sub-national leve<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ls. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry recently stated: At the provincial and the district levels we are working with jointly with our military through our provincial reconstruction teams, our district development and working groups and our district support teams, which help build Afghan capacity, particularly in the areas of greatest insecurity, in southern and eastern Afghanistan.” 25 Ambassador Eikenberry further stated: “</span><span style="background-color: yellow;">This is part of the counterinsurgency strategy designed to protect the people and make their lives better. A more effective government</span> lessens the support for the insurgency and rebuilding the farm sector, in particular, <span style="background-color: yellow;">is essential for the Afghan government to reduce the pool of unemployed men who form the recruiting base for extremists.</span>” By <span style="font-size: 8pt;">having a work force that is engaged in sustaining the local community, </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">showing that the government can work</span>, and by feeding and sustaining their own people this <span style="background-color: yellow;">will lead to less</span> need of <span style="background-color: yellow;">reliance on the</span> rule of the <span style="background-color: yellow;">Taliban</span> and give democracy an opportunity to work. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Most reasonably the Afghan people want to live in a free society and they want a peaceful environment to raise their families. They want to be able to provide food, shelter and live safely without the threat of domination. They would like to see their children educated and they believe in a value system that would give them a better opportunity to live in peace. </span>News reports from inside Afghanistan have recently shown that many people want to support a government and a rule of law governmental process, which is evident by their recent elections. If all these things can come together for the people of Afghanistan, then Al-Qaeda will be more easily defeated<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even with some elements of the Taliban remaining intact, the Afghan people can learn to govern themselves. A stronger sustainable economy will pave the way for a successful mentorship program and will more easily allow Afghans to make their own decisions. </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">A strong stable agrarian economy capable of sustaining itself through the growing, trading, and moving of products throughout the country will certainly lend itself to decreased production of opium</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and increased production of other natural resources. </span>The bottom-line is that any strategy for rebuilding Afghanistan does include the kinetic rooting out the remaining elements of al Qaeda and radical Taliban, but the emphasis must remain on developing a sustainable economy by leveraging all the elements of national power used in concert. <span style="background-color: yellow;">A temporary increase in military force may be necessary to set the conditions for long-term progress</span>,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> but unless the other elements of power are sufficiently employed, the Afghanistan project will end in failure.</span></span><br />

<br />
<u>My findings refute</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the monadic level DPP, which suggests </span><u>that democracies are more peaceful than nondemocracies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and they reveal that </span><u>democracies are more likely than nondemocracies to be involved in and to initiate-interstate wars</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and MIDs. Wedding these findings to those in Chapter 2, it appears that </span><u>the spread of democracy may precipitate an increase in the likelihood of wars as individual states become democratic</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and, subsequently, more war prone. Further, casting these findings in the light of 'recent studies of the DPP highlights some daunting prospects or global peace. For example, recent empirical findings indicate that </span><u>regime changes are much more likely to occur during or following wars</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and that losing states are much more likely to experience regime change (Bueno de Mesquita et at.. 1992). </span><u>Since democracies are more likely to win wars</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as compared to nondemocracies (Lake, 1992; Stam, 1996; Reiter and Stam, 1998a), it follows that </span><u>nondemocracies are more likely to experience regime change, which</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in some cases </span><u>may result in their full democratization</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The result is that </span><u>war involvement may actually increase the proportion of democratic states in the system and, subsequently, increase the likelihood of war-fare for those newly democratic states</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. From this perspective, the spread of democracy will create more-of the most war-prone states, thereby increasing the likelihood of war involvement and initiation for those states. These relationships hardly encourage a sanguine view of the prospects for peace with a democratic enlargement strategy. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The first and most obvious conclusion is that </span><u>there is no uniform relationship between democracy and the environment</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Three of our indicators, </span><u>deforestation, CO, emissions, and soil erosion</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by water, </span><u>demonstrated</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> significant </span><u>negative relationships between democracy and environmental preservation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Protected land area showed a positive relationship, and fresh water avail-ability and soil erosion by chemicals demonstrated no significant relationship. Of even greater interest, perhaps, is the fact that </span><u>these relationships ran counter to expectation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Gleditsch &amp; Sverdrup, 1995; Payne, 1995). Instead of positive relationships between the extent of democracy an environmental protection, as much popular and recent scholarly writings have suggested, the associations found here are principally negative or non-existent. </span><u>This should give pause to political leaders</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> such as President Clinton and Vice President Gore </span><u>who have trumpeted the virtues of democracy in protecting the environment</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The answer to this question may lie in the primary driver of a nascent weapon program.: </span><u>Is the program driven wholly by the whims of a particular regime. or</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is it instead driven by </span><u>long term regional insecurities</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and security vulnerabilities? </span><u>The examples of India and Israel show that even healthy democracies may pursue an advanced nuclear</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and missile </span><u>arsenal outside the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> bounds of the </span><u>NPT framework.</u> <strong><u>Regime change and democratization is not a miracle cure</u> . 2.

<u>By the UN's standards, the &quot;wrong people&quot; to win elections are extremists,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> armed bullies, a tyrannical majority defined by ethnicity or religion, and crooks. Such groups have demonstrated time and time again that they benefit most from a premature rush to the ballot box and from the sham legitimacy that confers. </span><u>Equally worrying is the</u> <u>prospect of losers who turn against a process that excluded them and refuse to accept its results.</u> <u>Experience shows</u> <u>such people all too often continue the contest by other means, violent or otherwise. An election is a contest, and a</u> <u>contest is necessarily combative.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In countries with clear rules, even the losers trust that the rules have been applied fairly and peacefully, and wait patiently to try again next time. That is the essence of legitimacy. But those </span><u>rules</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and that trust, </span><u>take time to establish.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> They require freedom to move, assemble and talk. </span><u>In cases where elections are</u> <u>premature and arranged hastily and badly, the expectations raised can become a</u> <strong><u>dangerous force.</u></strong> UN officials have already suggested that, in Iraq, all the evidence suggests that clear rules could not at present be applied equally and fairly and be accepted. Few are equipped to make that judgment. As a reporter who covered elections and power struggles across Africa and Afghanistan, I am well aware <u>there is no perfect formula. Try any country, no matter how</u> <u>troubled, there comes a time when society,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if it chooses </span><strong>democracy,</strong> <u>has to go to the polls. Windows of opportunity</u> <u>can close. But in Africa, I saw first-hand that elections do not guarantee</u> <strong><u>democracy.</u></strong> <u>In. fact, they can make matters</u> <u>worse. In Kenya,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> where I was based, </span><u>multiparty elections</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the 1990s effectively </span><u>entrenched a venal, one-party</u> <u>state that oversaw the country's economic collapse.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Only in 2002 did the government actually change, and even then it was replaced by an alliance of many former regime stalwarts. In neighbouring </span><u>Uganda</u><u>, the elections that brought</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> M </span><strong>Milton <u>Obote</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in </span><strong>the</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">early </span><strong>1980s</strong> <u>led to war and a</u> <strong><u>violent takeover</u></strong> <u>by</u> Yoweri <u>Museveni.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Close to two decades later, despite further &quot;elections&quot;, he clings on to power, </span><u>people feel disenfranchised, and war rages</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the north. And </span><strong><u>the list goes on</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There is a growing amount of literature on the subject. Fareed </span><strong>Zakaria,</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">editor of Newsweek International, has written eloquently about the dangers of &quot;illiberal </span><strong>democracy&quot;.</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Simon Chesterman, of the International Peace Academy, warns in his forthcoming book You the People that &quot;technical triumph has only rarely been matched by political success. In general, the emphasis has been on form at the expense of substance.&quot; </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Kennedy: Over the past two or three decades, many Asian nations have increased their defense budgets, while European countries have done otherwise. During this time, </span><u>there have been many flash points in Asia, such North Korea, Taiwan and Kashmir. Some Asian countries have</u> <strong><u>developed nuclear weapons</u></strong> <u>,</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">as contrasted with few Europeans who even want nuclear power stations today. We have good reason to feel worried that </span><strong><u>Asia could become a tinderbox</u></strong> <u>should there be any conflict in disputed territories like the Spratly Islands and a</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">n</span> <u>autistic</u> <u>North Korean regime</u> <u>that does not bother to understand the outside world.</u> <u>Taiwan</u> <u>is often rash</u> <u>to provoke Beijing,</u> <u>while</u> <u>the</u> <u>Kashmir</u> <u>conflict</u> <u>could grow into an India-Pakistan war</u><u>.</u> <u>There is great concern about how we should ensure that bitter rivalries in the Asian part of the globe will not bring down a system that is emerging in the world now</u><u>. We do not want a repeat of 1914.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">I am concerned that an armed conflict might arise in South or East Asia in 2008, for example, and bring down the credit, financial flow and capital in the region. </span><br />

<strong>4. Democracies destroy biodiversity</strong><br />

<u>This finding of a positive association</u> <u>between democracy and deforestation is far</u> <u>more likely to be the result of</u> <u>a</u> <u>process</u> <u>over-looked by theorists</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of democracy, namely </span><u>the</u> <u>sensitivity</u> <u>of</u> <u>democratically</u> <u>elected</u> <u>governments</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>and needs of</u> <u>their</u> <u>populations in many Third World coun­</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tries. </span><u>Fearful of being</u> <u>ejected</u> <u>from</u> <u>office</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by a disgruntled land-poor peasantry, elected politicians in Third World countries </span><u>may accede to</u> <u>the</u> <u>demands</u> <u>for</u> <u>land</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>substan­</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tial portion of the electorate. This conclu­sion is rein ores t higher partial correlation for the political rights index em­phasizing voting in comparison with the other two measures. If the preceding argu­ments are correct, then a measure based principally on voting rights should demon­strate a stronger impact on deforestation than would others based on liberal democ­racy or democratic institutionalization as in the instances of the Bollen index and Polity III. Even if many of the peasantry in rural lo</span><u>cations</u> <u>do</u> <u>not</u> <u>vote,</u> <u>possi</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">b</span><u>ilities</u> <u>for</u> <u>demonstrations,</u> <u>squatting</u> <u>or</u> <u>other</u> <u>headline-commanding</u> <u>behavior</u> <u>might</u> <u>be</u> <u>sufficient</u> <u>to</u> <u>allow</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> deforestation on a massive scale </span><u>to</u> <em><u>satisfy</u></em> <u>the</u> <u>land-poor.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In other respects, how-ever, wealthy and European countries exhibit a negative relationship with defor­estation. Indeed, the values for European countries are almost uniformly negative in this time-period, implying reforestation ac­tivities. Because of concerns about the impact on the findings of the control for European location, the analyses were also run without this variable. Comparisons revealed no sub­stantial differences with or without the control for Europe other than the loss of percentage variance explained in the latter instance. Similarly, although additional variables altered somewhat the values of coefficients, no substantial differences in findings were obtained when the variables log age and precipitation were omitted from analyses of dependent variables where they might have been less relevant as explanatory factors. </span><u>There</u> <u>is</u> <u>an</u> <u>additional</u> <u>possible</u> <u>source</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of </span><u>the relationship between democracy and deforestation</u> <u>and</u> <u>pertains</u> <u>to</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u>permeability</u> <u>o''Third World</u> <u>democracies</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>efforts of</u> <u>large cattle</u> <u>ranchers,</u> <u>fanners,</u> <u>and</u> <u>multina­tional</u> <u>corporations</u> <u>involved</u> <u>in agribusiness.</u> <u>As members of legislative</u> <u>assemblies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in Third World countries or with strop </span><u>influence</u> <u>upon</u> <u>them,</u> <u>the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> large-scale rancher or farmer may </span><u>be</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>unique</u> <u>position</u> <u>to</u> <u>control</u> <u>forest</u> <u>resources</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and initiate defor­estation measures for purposes of farming. At the same time, local democratically elected authorities also have forest areas ceded to them by national governments, and these forests then are `managed' by the local 'authorities. </span><br />

<u>Democracies also tend to favor easy money</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even when it's not the technically correct prescription for sound economic policies:</span> <u>it's a sure way for politicians to curry favor with the masses. The danger is that when several countries do this, the world economy develops a bias toward inflation-which ultimately is destructive to long-term growth</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is therefore vital to establish fiercely independent central banks with governors strong enough to withstand political pressure. Right now, for example, the finance ministers from Germany and France are in a highly visible fight with Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, over his insistence that now is not the right time to lower interest rates in the eurozone. This kind of confrontation is sure to be played out in many countries over the next few years. Speaking of easy money,</span> <u>democracies like to open the spending spigot, even when they shouldn't</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Case in point: Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is right now under intense public pressure to abandon his admirable fiscal conservatism in order to gun the economic engines. The temptation may be politically irresistible and even understandable, but international financial markets will not be pleased. </span><u>Even the most advanced democracies, such as the United States, France and Germany, have demonstrated an inability to build the necessary long-term safety nets to prosper in a hvpercompetitive global economy. Obviously, so too will less sophisticated democracies. Think about America's inability to rein in its enormous fiscal deficits</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, despite the certainty of massive upcoming expenses relating to Social Security and health care for its aging population. Or about the inability of major European nations to establish economically viable pension and unemployment compensation systems. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Could the current economic crisis affecting this country and the world lead to another world war? The answer may be found by looking back in history. </span><u>One of the causes of World War I was the economic rivalry that existed between the nations of Europe.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In the 19th century France and Great Britain became wealthy through colonialism and the control of foreign resources. This forced other up-and-coming nations (such as Germany) to be more competitive in world trade which led to rivalries and ultimately, to war. </span><u><span style="background-color: aqua;">After the Great Depression ruined the economies of Europe</span> in the 1930s, <span style="background-color: aqua;">fascist movements arose to seek</span> economic and social <span style="background-color: aqua;">control</span>. From there fanatics like <span style="background-color: aqua;">Hitler and Mussolini took over</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Germany and Italy and led them both into World War II.</span> <u>With most of North America and Western Europe currently experiencing a recession, will competition for resources and economic rivalries with the Middle East, Asia, or South American cause another world war?</u> <strong><span style="background-color: aqua;"><u>Add in nuclear weapons and Islamic fundamentalism and things look even worse.</u> </span></strong><u>Hopefully the economy gets better before it gets worse and the terrifying possibility of World War III is averted.

<strong>7. Democracy undermines <u>free trade</u> Garten, 4 –</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While the global story of the 1990s was the opening of economies around the world, the bigger theme for this decade is the deepening and maturing of democratic movements. Both trends are cause for cheer, but the two may not reinforce one another, especially in the next several years. In fact, the </span><u>flowering of democracy may slow economic globalization even as it makes it more inclusive and more equitable over time. The growth of democracy could, for example, slow the expansion of international trade. Reason: a democratic government cannot decree the dropping of barriers but must listen to the views of farmers, workers, manufacturers nongovernmental organizations and others. In many countries, the voice of public opinion will play a larger role than ever before. At best, this is likely to delay international trade talks as governments attempt to reach delicate compromises among competing interests at home. At worst, it could lead to rising protectionism as anti-trade groups scream the loudest.</u><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Olin Foundation (The Challenge from the East and the Rebirth of the West, p. 121) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The choice facing the West today is much the same as that which faced the Soviet bloc after World War II: between meeting head-on the challenge of world trade with the adjustments and the benefits that it will bring, or of attempting to shut out markets that are growing and where a dynamic new pace is being set for innovative production. The problem about the second approach is not simply that it won’t hold: satellite technology alone will ensure that consumers will begin to demand those goods that the East is able to provide most cheaply. More fundamentally, it will guarantee the emergence of a fragmented world in which natural fears will be fanned and inflamed. </span><u>A world divided into</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">rigid</span> <u>trade blocs will be a deeply troubled and unstable place in which suspicion and ultimately envy will possibly erupt into a major war</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I do not say that the converse will necessarily be true, that in a free trading world there will be an absence of all strife. Such a proposition would manifestly be absurd. But </span><u>t</u><u>o trade is to become interdependent, and that is a good step in the direction of world stability. With nuclear weapons at two a penny, stability will be at a premium in the years ahead.</u><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is one more speculation worth noting, if only because it has been almost wholly ignored. Namely: </span><u>The consequences of democratization will pose the chief and most enduring challenge to U.S. primacy. Never have there been more electoral democracies in the world</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - 121 today, by Freedom House's latest count, up from 66 in 1987. So far, this trend has been cause mainly for American celebration. Viewed </span><u>from the United States, democratization has been easy to construe as imitation - the sincerest form of flattery.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> American politicians routinely project U.S. democratic values as not just humane but human: what, deep in their hearts, everyone thinks and wants or, at any rate, would if they knew what was best. </span><u>Whatever the accuracy of this presumption, it is at least less fantastic than the idea that installing the right to vote in a formerly authoritarian state will necessarily instill, among the newly enfranchised, sympathy for U.S. foreign policy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - what Washington does as opposed to what Americans may believe. gis' extensive air defense capability, and joint operability. </span><u>It is no coincidence that recently elected governments in Turkey and South Korea are not cheerleaders for confronting Iraq and North Korea, respectively. Living adjacent to the “evil axis” makes Turks and South Koreans uniquely vulnerable to the consequences of belligerence. Their electoral democracies assure that public fears based on this vulnerability cannot be ignored.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">As a senior adviser to Turkey's new prime minister recently observed, “Everybody knows that 80 to 85 percent of the Turkish people would say no to war in Iraq. As a democratic country, how can we say yes?” Gerhard Schröder's decision to comply with such logic in Germany's latest election is a main reason he remains chancellor of that country. </span><u>And these countries are U.S. allies. Nor is the prospect of democratic divergence limited to these admittedly special cases. In foreign democracies generally, other things being equal, it is implausible that candidates and voters should consistently favor U.S. positions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Most Muslims, for example, are moderate. But in countries with large Muslim majorities and without strong secular traditions, it is not hard to envision an election whose results reduce the distance between state and religion, regardless of what the U.S. constitution's first amendment recommends. Nor is the chance of such outcomes limited to balloting among Muslims, witness the recent electoral success of hardline Hindus in the Indian state of Gujarat. Democratization need not be inimical to U.S. foreign policies. </span><u>But democratic divergence in a more and more democratic world can be expected to limit the ability of U.S. administrations to act unilaterally in ways that significantly threaten or burden other countrie</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s. What is an election, after all, if not a multilateral consultation, among voters rather than states? Qualifications are needed: Democracies may diverge not only from the U.S. but also from each other. European disunity over Iraq is an illustration. An irony of unilateralist American rhetoric is that it can help stimulate a multilateral façade - a coalition of the somewhat willing - by motivating foot-dragging governments to move closer to Washington lest they lose all leverage and favor in the event of superpower success. Under mounting American pressure to become a launching pad for war against Baghdad, Ankara's “no” already has modulated to “yes” with reservations. And then there is British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has been willing to ignore his own constituency's reluctance to say “yes” to President Bush - convergence at the top despite divergence from below. </span><u>The implications of democratic divergence for U.S. power, therefore, are</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not its overthrow but its </span><u>complication - and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, prospectively, </span><u>its erosion.</u><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because </span><u>a world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, </span><u>such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the world's major problems, such as </span><u>nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally</span><u>,</u> <u>U.S.</u> <u>leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the United States and </span><u>the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and</u> <u>all the attendant dangers, including</u> <u>a global nuclear exchange</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.</span><br />

<strong>The affirmative is a mimetic simulation of war, not an objective depiction of possible outcomes.

<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It might seem tendentious, especially at a time when world leaders and leading political theorists herald an epoch of democratic peace, to invoke a thinker and a concept drawn from an interwar experience. But are we not currently experiencing a similar acceleration of technological, social and political change? In the last decade, there have not been abrupt shifts in configurations of power but also in what Benjamin referred to as radical breaks in &quot;the structure of experience,&quot; that is, how we think about and represent change. </span>My question<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span>stems<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not only from an appreciation of the conceptual powers of Benjamin but also </span>from the official mimetic actions that are currently underway to plot an uncertain future. I refer to <span style="background-color: yellow;">the mimetic powers of military and diplomatic simulation. Sold</span> by their users <span style="background-color: yellow;">as mere preparations for worst-case scenarios</span>, they <span style="background-color: yellow;">help to produce and delimit, through</span> holistic training, <span style="background-color: yellow;">hyperreal modeling</span> and potential negative synergy, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the dangers and possibilities of the future</span>. Digitized, <span style="background-color: yellow;">virtual war games</span> and peace games, twice <span style="background-color: yellow;">removed</span> by scripted strategies and technological artifice <span style="background-color: yellow;">from the bloody reality of war, take simulation into another realm</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>They take us to Jean Baudrillard's fractal turf of the hyperreal, <span style="background-color: yellow;">where distinctions between the simulated and the real begin to break down</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Baudrillard is willing to concede distinctions of a Baconian nature, stating: &quot;To dissimulate is to feign not to have what one has. To simulate is to feign to have what one hasn't. One implies a presence, the other an absence.&quot;29 However, in societies suffused with virtual technologies, &quot;the matter is more complicated, since </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">to simulate is not simply to feign</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot;30 </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">Simulations produce real symptoms</span>, hyperreal effects<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: &quot;Thus, feigning or dissimulating leaves the reality principle intact: </span>the difference is always clear, it is only masked; whereas simulation threatens the difference between 'true' and 'false,' between 'real' and 'imaginary.'&quot;<span style="font-size: 8pt;">31 Things get further complicated when &quot;the real is no longer what it used to be&quot;32—an apposite description of post-Cold War attitudes—and </span>the power of <span style="background-color: yellow;">simulation</span>, magnified by a fear of the future or a nostalgia for a mythical past, <span style="background-color: yellow;">comes to dominate all other forms of representation</span>. It becomes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, says Baudrillard</span>, &quot;a strategy of the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> real, </span>neo-real<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and hyperreal, </span>whose universal double is the strategy of deterrence<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot;33 </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">A neoliberal order</span> that ultimately <span style="background-color: yellow;">relies on</span> the cyberdeterrence of an overwhelming U.S. superiority in military planning, logistics and information technology seems uncomfortably close to Baudrillard's simulacrum<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Paul </span>Virilio sheds similar light on the current shift of representation into what he calls <span style="background-color: yellow;">the &quot;virtual theatricalization of the real world</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;: It has taken us </span>from statistical management to electoral polls to video wars, until politics becomes a form of &quot;cathodic democracy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot;34 An obsessive media vigilance over behavior combines with political correctness to transform democracy from an open, participatory form of government into a software program for the entertainment and control of all spectators. Speed enhances a global &quot;shrinking effect:&quot; &quot;With acceleration there is no more here and there, only the mental confusion of near and far, present and future, real and unreal—a mix of history, stories, and the hallucinatory Utopia of communication technologies.&quot;35 The coeval emergence of a mass media and </span>an industrial army was the signifying moment of modernity, of <span style="background-color: yellow;">a capability to war without war</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, producing &quot;a parallel information market&quot; of propaganda, illusion, dissimulation. However, technological accelerants such as satellite linkups, real-time feeds, and high-resolution video threaten the power of television to dissimulate. Now </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">the danger lies in the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> media's </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">power to &quot;substitute&quot; realities. With the appearance of a global view comes the disappearance of the viewer subject</span>: In the immediacy of perception, our eyes become indistinguishable from the camera's optics, and <span style="background-color: yellow;">critical consciousness goes missing</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In one of his signature, panoramic scans of contemporary society, Virilio early on captured the virtual effects of new media: In our situations of televisual experience, we are living in nothing less than the sphere of Einstein's relativity, which wasn't at all the case at the time that he wrote it since that was a world of trolley cars, and at most the rocket. But today we live in a space of relativity and non-separability. Our image of time is an image of instantaneity and ubiquity. And there's a stunning general lack of understanding of speed, a lack of awareness of the essence of speed . . . .And this passage from an extensive to an intensive time will have considerable impact on all the various aspects of the conditions of our society : it leads to a radical reorganization both of our social mores and our image of the world. This is the source of the feeling that we're faced with an epoch in many ways comparable to the Renaissance: </span>it's an epoch in which <span style="background-color: yellow;">the real world and our image of the world no longer coincide</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.36 </span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>The impact is twofold—</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First, the mimetic construction of war makes wars inevitable—it requires the construction of an “evil” enemy and makes extermination viable—extinction becomes necessary because it is the only predictable outcome</strong><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">The charge of moral equivalency<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—in which any attempt at explanation is identified as an act of exoneration—</span>should not deter investigations into the dangers of the mimetic relationships operating in war and games<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">People go to war not only out of rational calculation but also because of how they</span> see, perceive, picture, imagine, and speak of each other<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: that is, </span>how they <span style="background-color: yellow;">construct the difference of other groups as well as the sameness of their own</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein are not the first to mine this act of mimesis for political advantage. From Greek tragedy and Roman gladiatorial spectacles to futurist art and fascist rallies, </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">mimetic violence</span> has regularly <span style="background-color: yellow;">overpowered democratic discourse</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The question, then, is </span>how long<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> after Baghdad has fallen </span>will this mimetic game of terror and counter-terror last? Bush, Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein need their mimetic foes—it takes two to play<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">Without a reciprocal hatred</span>, their <span style="background-color: yellow;">politics and prophecies lose their self-fulfilling powers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Historically, terrorist movements either evolve into states, or, without a mass base, they quickly weaken and rarely last longer than a decade. And empires inevitably, by over-reach or defeat, fall. However, </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">this mimetic struggle</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, magnified by the media, fought by advanced technologies of destruction, and unchecked by the UN or U.S. allies, </span>has now <span style="background-color: yellow;">developed a logic of its own in which</span> assimilation or <span style="background-color: yellow;">extermination become plausible solutions</span>, credible policies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Under such circumstances, </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">one longs for the</span> sure bet, a <span style="background-color: yellow;">predictable unfolding of events</span>, or at least a comforting conclusion<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “At this stage of the game” (as Schwartzkopf said in the midst of GW1), I have none, because </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">the currently designed game</span>, to rid the world of evil, <span style="background-color: yellow;">cannot possibly find an end</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Inevitably, what Edmund Burke called the empire of circumstance will surely, and let us hope not too belatedly, trump Bush’s imperial game as well as Bin Laden’s terrorist one. When tempted in the interim by the promise of virtuous war to solve the world’s problems, we best listen to the great Yogi: “If the world were perfect, it wouldn’t be.” </span></span><br />

<strong>Second, the divorcing of trauma from war allows killing without responsibility—this is the root of the genocidal mindset</strong><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In a sense, </span>war has always been a virtual reality, too traumatic for immediate comprehension. Trauma<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Freud tells us, </span>can be re-enacted, even re-experienced, but cannot be understood at the moment of shock<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is what Michael Herr was getting at in Dispatches, when he wrote about his experiences in Vietnam: 'It took the war to teach it, that you were as responsible for everything you saw as you were for everything you did. The problem was that you didn't always know what you were seeing until later, maybe years later, that a lot of it never made it in at all, it just stayed stored there in your eyes'.2 </span>But now there is an added danger, a further distancing of understanding<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">When compared to the real trauma of war, the pseudo-trauma of simulation pales</span><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">But an insidious threat emerges from its shadowing of reality. In this</span> high-tech <span style="background-color: yellow;">rehearsal for war, one learns how to kill but not to take responsibility for it, one experiences 'death' but not the tragic consequences of it</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the extreme case, with the predisposed pathologies of a Milosevic in Serbia, a McVeigh in Oklahoma City, or a Harris in Littleton, Colorado, </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">this can lead to a</span> kind of doubling or <span style="background-color: yellow;">splitting of the self</span> that psychologists Robert Jay Lifton and Erik Markusen see as <span style="background-color: yellow;">a source of the 'genocidal mentality'</span>. But what I have witnessed is more a closing than an opening of a schism, between how we see and live, represent and experience, simulate and fight war<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>New technologies of imitation and <span style="background-color: yellow;">simulation</span> as well as <span style="background-color: yellow;">surveillance and speed have collapsed</span> the geographical distance, chronological duration, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the gap</span> itself <span style="background-color: yellow;">between the reality and virtuality of war</span>. As the confusion of one for the other grows, <span style="background-color: yellow;">we now face the danger of a new kind of trauma</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> without sight, drama without tragedy, </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">where</span> television <span style="background-color: yellow;">wars and</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">video </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">war games blur together</span>. </span><br />

<strong>Our alternative is to reject the aff in favor of reformed constructivism—only a co-opted constructivist viewpoint can critique virtual theory and explain international events</strong><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">On </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">the epistemological spectrum</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, this clearly </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">places the virtualists nearer to the constructivists than</span> the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> rationalists or </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">realists</span><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">Virtual theory repudiates</span> the philosophical <span style="background-color: yellow;">realism and positivism</span> underlying most social science theory, <span style="background-color: yellow;">where</span> words transparently mirror objects, facts reside apart from values, and <span style="background-color: yellow;">theory is independent of the reality that it represents</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.'3 Yet, I have found little of intellectual or pragmatic utility in the metatheoretical, structuralist, and curiously amorphous forms (again, where are the bodies/agents?) that constructivism has taken in International Relations. To me it is a step backwards, from structuralism to bloburalism, to invoke that classic of the I950s, 'The Blob', where misunderstood teenagers (something of a stretch for the star, Steve McQueen) took on an extra-terrestrial gooey blob that had emerged from a meteor. In spite of efforts to destroy it by conventional means (i.e. lots of firepower), it grows to gargantuan proportions by parasitically sucking the life out of humans. This might be something of a dramatic exaggeration, but some hyperbole might be warranted, if we are not to awake one day in the future, to find where once regime theorists ruled, critical theorists critiqued, standpoint feminists stood, epistemic communities communed, and post-structuralists problematized, only a protoplasmic trace remains. Not even the 'English school' of international theory appears to have raised the Oxbridge in time against the constructivist onslaught. Only neo-realists and neo-liberals, occupying the higher reaches of the discipline, protected by positivism from non-observable phenomena like the Blob, have so far escaped its saprophytic attack. Constructivism in International Relations has demonstrated a remarkable capability to absorb any approach that privileges epistemology over methodology, identity over interest, relativism over rationalism, social facts over empirical data. To be fair, there are less metaphorical, not quite so philosophically obtuse, more practical reasons for the growth of constructivism. It can be attributed to the quality of its scholarship, the proselytizing energy of its proponents, as well as the strategic if somewhat compromising position it strives to occupy between other 'post-modem', 'rigid', 'hardcore', 'radical' or 'strong' approaches.'4 It could be argued that </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">constructivism</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is spreading because it </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">provides new and valuable concepts for interpreting a rapidly changing world that older approaches in IR</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have not, and perhaps </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">cannot provide</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.'5 Indeed, it could be argued that argumentation itself, now thriving in the increasingly pluralistic and fragmented subfields of IR and schools of the social sciences, favours constructivism, which at least theoretically practises (a pragmatic evaluation of competing truth-claims) what it preaches (the world is what we make of it).i6 </span>How, then, to link virtual theory to constructivism without falling prey to its blob-like qualities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">? </span>There is the conventional approach, that would rest constructivist claims with precise definitions, comparative literature reviews, theoretical analysis, and the reductionist diagram<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> viz., the kind of professional activity that keeps us all busy and our journals in business. Following economic models, </span>this primitive accumulation of knowledge might well result in a great leap forward to a new stage of intellectual development in International Relations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>However, progress<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in history, as well as discontinuous, epistemic innovation in science, </span>rarely takes the linear path of incrementalism<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>A less direct critique might be more effective<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It need not be on the order of past polemics, like Hedley Bull's infamous frontal assault on behaviouralists, which, we should remember, was spurred by his belief that one should 'study their position until one could state their own arguments better than they could and then-when they were least suspecting-to turn on them and slaughter them in an academic massacre of Glencoe'.17 Given the nature of the beast, </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">it might be more appropriate to play down the minor differences, to mimic constructivism</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, say, as predators do their prey, </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">and co-opt it from without</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Steve McQueen discovered the hard way, Blobs are pretty much immune to flaming or caging: direct confrontation is just more thought for food. Not wishing to escalate to the thermonuclear level (as they did, counter-productively, in the sequel, 'Beware the Blob!'<span style="background-color: yellow;">), </span></span><span style="background-color: yellow;">I suggest a</span> different strategy for the <span style="background-color: yellow;">de-blobbing of constructivism</span>, one <span style="background-color: yellow;">that is empirical, historical, and political, which refigures constructivism as a progenitor rather than pre-empter of virtual theory</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">I have reflected on Keohane's well-traveled road. I have weighed its quite reason- able rules against the historical evidence, the international events born out of both accidental (famine, flood, earthquake) and intentional (war, terrorism, genocide) disasters that have taken place on this road. I have considered Keohane's destination, the higher &quot;normative grounds&quot; of &quot;international cooperation,&quot; and found it to be laudable, and indeed shared by many of the reflective routes. But his conclusion makes the unbeaten track seem more appealing if not necessary: </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">it is not in synthesis but</span> by learning to live with <span style="background-color: yellow;">irreconcilable differences</span> and multiple identities-in high theory and in everyday practices-<span style="background-color: yellow;">that we might find our best hope</span> for international relations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I think here Keohane might agree: </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">unless we are willing</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> now and then </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">to head</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the big American car of international relations theory </span><u>off <span style="background-color: yellow;">in untried</span>, untestable, <span style="background-color: yellow;">even unreasonable directions, the only</span> perpetual <span style="background-color: yellow;">peace</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">-to update Kant-</span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">will be</span> that of <span style="background-color: yellow;">the</span> roadside <span style="background-color: yellow;">kill</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.' This essay is not a polemic against Keohane's rationalist institutionalism, nor is it a theoretical defense of post-structuralism. They are no longer needed, for each side has begun to recognize the legitimacy of the dialogue if not the epistemological claims of the other.2 Judging, however, from critical comments that have arisen as much from confusion as from disagreement, a few prefatory points are in order about </span><u>some <span style="background-color: yellow;">differences between rationalists and poststructuralists</span> that <span style="background-color: yellow;">resist synthesis</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. First, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">post-structuralism is</span> a semio-critical activity, ever searching for and <span style="background-color: yellow;">seeking to dismantle the empirico-rational positions where power fixes meaning</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.3 Second, </span><u>post- structuralism does not hold that reflectivists or rationalists reflect the field of international relations. Both use and are used by language</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, by the tropes, rhetoric, narratives and grammar that make up an array of ambiguous and indeterminate signifying practices. I</span><u>t is this heterological nature of discourse that dominant powers</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in a demonstrative, hegemonic act, </span><u>always dream of fixing, reducing, subjecting to a single, monological meaning</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Third, </span><u>the <span style="background-color: yellow;">rationalists</span> demonstrate this power play when they <span style="background-color: yellow;">construct a</span> transcendental, <span style="background-color: yellow;">privileged space to make truth-claims</span> about international relations (like those made by game and rational choice theory</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from the supposed high-point of scientific progress). Alternatively-and Keohane deserves credit for now making it less of an alternative-</span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the rationalists might simply ignore the problem of discourse</span>, in the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> vain </span><u>hope that it will ignore them</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But the poststructuralists are always aware of-and always irritating others by demonstrating-the stickiness of the web of meaning.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nietzsche and Derrida offer a penetrating critique of sovereignty, yet. . . it lives, most demonstrably in international theory and diplomatic statecraft, as, no less, the realist perspective. What do we mean by &quot;realism&quot;? It encompasses a worldview in which sovereign states, struggling for power under conditions of anarchy, do what they must to maintain and promote their own self-interests. </span><u>But what do &quot;we&quot; mean by &quot;realism&quot;?</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We realists, constituted by and representing disciplinary schools of thought, diplomatic corps, intelligence bureaucracies, depict things as they really are, rather than as idealists might wish them to be. And what do &quot;we&quot; mean by &quot;realism&quot;? </span><u>We mean what we say and say what we mean, in that <span style="background-color: yellow;">transparent</span> way of <span style="background-color: yellow;">correspondence</span> that <span style="background-color: yellow;">provides the</span> veridical, commonsensical, <span style="background-color: yellow;">deadly discourses of realism, as &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot; assures our security, or &quot;we had to destroy the village in order to save it</span>.&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But with the end of the Cold War, and pace Nietzsche, why beat a dead horse? Precisely </span><u>because <span style="background-color: yellow;">realism does death so well, by refusing to acknowledge</span> not only i<span style="background-color: yellow;">ts ongoing complicity in the death of others</span> but also the fact that it gave up the ghost a long time ago. How many times</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, after how many &quot;revolutionary&quot; transitions, </span><u>have we heard that sovereignty is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at bay, at an end, </span><u>dead?</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There is always the easy deflection, that sovereignty is an &quot;essentially contested concept,&quot; a &quot;convenient fiction,&quot; that changes with the times. But </span><u>the frequency of such death notices</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, from politicians, military strategists and pundits, as well as academicians, </span><u>leads one to suspect that something other than funerary oration, philosophical speculation, or a topic for a special issue is at work. Is there a darker, even gothic side to the sovereign state, a hidden power that resides in its recurrent morbidity?</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Take a look at some of the principal necroses. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Realism has built a life out of the transformation of fictions, such as the immutability of human nature and the</span> apodictic <span style="background-color: yellow;">threat of anarchy, into fact</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. With a little digging, realism comes to resemble nothing so much as the undead, a perverse mimesis of the living other, haunting international politics through the objectification of power, the immutability of human nature and the apodictic threat of anarchy, into fact. With a little digging, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">realism comes to resemble</span> nothing so much as the undead, <span style="background-color: yellow;">a perverse mimesis of the living other, haunting international politics through the objectification of power, the festishizing of weaponry, the idealization of the state, the virtualization of violence</span> and the globalization of new media</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Now </span><u>the fact of realism's own death lives on as a powerful fiction</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as the morbid customs, characteristics and habits of the living dead. If this sounds more like Stephen King than Nietzsche or Derrida, so be it. </span><u>Not that he or they would claim to put an end to realism</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—as if that were possible—</span><u>but rather, to render it more responsible for reproducing a world it claims only to record</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Nietzsche recognizes the allure of realism by citing some exemplars in history: My recreation, my preference, my cure from all Platonism has always been Thucydides. Thucydides and, perhaps, Machiavelli's Principe are most closely related to myself by the unconditional will not to gull oneself and to see reason in reality—not in &quot;reason,&quot; still less in &quot;morality.&quot; .. . One must turn him over line by line and read his hidden thoughts. Sophist culture, by which I mean realist culture, attains in him its perfect expression ... Courage in face of reality ultimately distinguishes such natures as Thucydides and Plato: Plato is a coward in face of reality—consequently he flees into the ideal; Thucydides has himself under control—consequently he retains control over things.12 </span><u>Self-control as the antidote for the will—born out of resentment and fear—to control the other: This is not a bad place to begin when <span style="background-color: yellow;">reality is spectralized by virtuality</span>. It might help to explain the obduracy of realism <span style="background-color: yellow;">as we</span> increasingly <span style="background-color: yellow;">interact with a mimetic world</span> that seems to be <span style="background-color: yellow;">in the control of virtual &quot;things&quot; that imitate reality</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (such as opinion polls, worst-case scenarios, Sky TV, Microsoft, Disney, Inc.). In the realm of international theory, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">this means realism</span> once again &quot;<span style="background-color: yellow;">flees into the ideal</span>,&quot; this time, <span style="background-color: yellow;">of</span> a &quot;democratic peace&quot; underwritten by an ever-enlarging <span style="background-color: yellow;">neoliberal global order</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Plato to NATO might seem to be an ontological stretch, but to this jaded eye </span><u>the enlargement of the neoliberal order resembles nothing so much as a platonic, utility-maximizing Blob, an ideal-formlessness absorbing all who come into contact with the prepolitical protoplasm of market forces and security imperatives</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It takes more than the courage of the Sophists </span><u>to face the seemingly inexorable forces of virtual realities, telecast in the functionalist, utilitarian and rationalist language of the neoliberal order</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Perhaps Nietzsche is right: </span><u>It takes a virtuous, even poetic, willfulness</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, like Machiavelli's, </span><u>to confront the reality principle of realism, sovereignty and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its ultimate ratio, </span><u>war. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Realism's </span>long, <span style="background-color: yellow;">intimate history with violence</span>, whether <span style="background-color: yellow;">in the guise of impartial observer or amoral reproducer, requires that</span> if we are to have anything meaningful to say to realism, <span style="background-color: yellow;">we</span> too <span style="background-color: yellow;">must get up close to the virtual technologies of representation</span>, preparation and execution of war</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Cultural studies has shown a reluctance to enter into proximity talks with violence. </span><u>This is one more reason to begin an extradisciplinary, intersubjective, ethical inquiry into the mimetic relationship of realism to organized violence, <span style="background-color: yellow;">beginning with</span> but not stopping at <span style="background-color: yellow;">the state violence of political realism, the class violence of social realism, the global violence of nuclear realism, the techno violence of hyperrealism</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Again, as Nietzsche shows us, it is better to embrace than beat an old horse. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">We face huge challenges in Afghanistan, to be sure. No one watching the news, or hearing President Barack Obama’s sober tone on Dec. 1 at West Point, or listening to testimony from Gen. Stanley McChrystal and Ambassador Karl Eikenberry last week, could doubt that basic reality. But </span><u>in these serious, difficult times, it is worth remembering all the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">things</span> that actually <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are working in our favor in Afghanistan now. First, Afghans want a better future for themselves</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is true for Afghans in their own country, as well as for the Diaspora of Afghans around the world — many of whom have moved back home to help build a new country, others of whom stand ready to invest, trade and assist in other ways. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Most Afghans</span> reject war. They also <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">reject the Taliban, by 90 percent or more in most polls</span>.</u> <u>Among the majority of the Afghan people who are not Pashtun, in fact, support for the Taliban is virtually zero</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even among the Durrani, one of the two main Pashtun tribal groupings, </span><u>support for the Taliban has been limited</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (the Taliban’s main support has come from the Pashtun Ghilzai tribes). </span><u>The Taliban is not a popular insurgency.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is in equal parts a narco-terrorist organization willing to use drug smuggling to finance its operations, an extremist Islamist movement with an intolerant view of nonbelievers and a backward view of the role of women, and a ruthless organization willing to use brutal violence against innocent, law-abiding citizens to impose its version of Islam. </span><u>Yes, it has achieved impressive discipline in its ranks in some ways, and battlefield momentum as well, but it has no positive vision for the country — and Afghans know it. There are also many good and committed “average citizens” in the country today.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In Kandahar City citizens are telling authorities about the locations of up to 80 percent of all improvised explosive devices before they go off, allowing security forces to defuse them. This high percentage, higher than ever witnessed in Iraq, further suggests that our efforts to quell the Taliban may have found unexpected support from the general population in one of the Taliban strongholds, support that a counterinsurgency can build upon. </span><u>Progress is apparent in other places too</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the town of Nawa in Helmand Province, for example, an infusion of U.S. forces in 2009 has turned a previously lawless area held by the Taliban into a relatively secure area where ordinary people can begin to get back to their daily lives. </span><u>Second, elements of the Afghan security forces are improving fast. This is most true for the army</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. With NATO’s International Security Assistance Force focused intently now on proper training and mentoring, </span><u>the building of Afghan security forces that can protect their own people should accelerate. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Third, life in Afghanistan has actually improved</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> somewhat compared with the recent past. Yes, the progress is uneven, and the poor remain very badly off. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">But </span></span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">overall the economy, education, healthcare and similar indicators are moving more in the right direction</span> than the wrong one.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Material progress has contributed to a reservoir of goodwill among the Afghan people toward those in authority. President Karzai, </span><u>the United States</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and NATO all still </span><u>enjoyed at least 60 percent support from the population as of summer 2009</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> — far better than the United States has enjoyed in Iraq. This popularity number is fragile, and uneven among different groups, but </span><u>we do have some advantages in how the Afghan public views the situation nonetheless. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Fourth</span>, NATO in general and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the United States</span> in particular <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">know how to carry out counterinsurgency missions better than ever before. Troops are experienced in the art of counterinsurgency and knowledgeable about Afghanistan</span>. We also have excellent commanders,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> starting with Central Command Combatant Cmdr. Gen. David Petraeus and Gen. McChrystal, who directs both the NATO forces and the separate, U.S.-led counterterrorism force carrying out Operation Enduring Freedom there. </span><u>Commanders at much lower levels of authority, the ones who execute the strategy day in and day out, are also seasoned and quite smart in the ways of this type of warfare. The importance of good leadership in counterinsurgency is very significant, and our strengths in this area are a major asset. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Fifth, enough troops are now on the way. Until now, on the ground, troop shortages prevented combined</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Afghan and NATO </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">forces from securing</span> many districts, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">towns</span> and villag</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">es. Worse, it left troops stalemated in dangerous situations over extended periods of time because they did not have the capacity to seize land and sustain control. It left NATO forces relying too heavily on air strikes with all their potential to cause accidental deaths of innocents (a policy that McChrystal has changed; air strikes are generally allowed now only if NATO troops are in direct peril). And it left Afghan citizens who cooperate with NATO and their government vulnerable to reprisal. </span><u>Only in 2009 did these realities finally begin to change; only in 2010 will we achieve reasonable overall force rations.</u> <u>To predict success outright would be to go too far. But I honestly believe that, setting our sights at a reasonable level, the odds are with us in this important mission.</u><br />

The ACC proposes a methodology that strives for operational adaptability and that seeks to &quot;develop the situation through action.&quot;39 To accomplish this, operators must have enough familiarity of their OE to set conditions, shape conditions if necessary, and then assess conditions for further adaptation. While executing these tasks, adversaries may continue to employ &quot;cultural standoff,&quot; causing judge advocates to reach deep into their operational law kit bag to help commanders disrupt an adversary's decisionmaking cycle and overwhelm its operational tempo<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. </span></span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Human Terrain Teams provide the command with the perfect tool to leverage </span></u><u>social and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">anthropological knowledge of the OE</span>, especially when the local population is the center of gravity.</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Just as commanders and other members of the battlestaff generally defer legal issues to judge advocates as the legal subject matter experts (SME), cultural issues should be deferred to HTTs as the relevant SME. </span><u>When employed, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">HTTs can help</span> defend against cultural standoff tactics, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">counter misleading and malicious cultural information</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and turn cultural standoff practices against an adversary, isolating it from the population</span>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Human Terrain Teams can also assist a unit to keep targeting below the &quot;Discrimination Threshold&quot; when conducting lethal and non-lethal operations against target</span>s.</u> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Human Terrain Teams can also safeguard against an overreliance by U.S. forces on misplaced notions of cultural savvyness</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> As a British military report observed, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">&quot;[a] little knowledge can be dangerous,</span></u> <u>masking important nuances and subtleties</u> <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. . . .

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">War assessments by policymakers and generals range from &quot;serious&quot; to &quot;dire&quot; to &quot;deteriorating.&quot; </span><u>Some long-term supporters are saying it's time for Uncle Sam to pull up his tent stakes and come home. So</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> while the Obama administration mulls Afghanistan, it's important for all to remember - especially in the shadow of the eighth anniversary of 9/11 - that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the stakes are</span> still <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">big</span> for us in that remote nation. Of course, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">we don't want to turn the country over to the Taliban</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">which would once again allow al-Qaeda to train, plot and set in motion the next 9/11</span>, with us as the likely target</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And, like Iraq, </span><u>dealing a blow to Islamist extremists in Afghanistan will have a salutary effect well beyond that country</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, increasing the security of those who find themselves in terrorist cross-hairs. But while often reduced to a fight with terrorists, Afghanistan is about much more than that. For instance, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">failing in Afghanistan could lead to (more) problems in</span> already-troubled, neighboring <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Pakistan,</span> where <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the Taliban</span> (and other extremists) <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have nuclear-armed Islamabad in their sights.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> While a remote possibility, the last thing anyone wants to see is the Pakistani government fall to radicals, who then would possess Islamabad's nuclear arsenal of a few hundred weapons. Perhaps increasing the odds of this, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Afghan territory could become</span> the reverse-image of Pakistan today, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">where the Taliban finds safe harbor</span> in tribal areas for their cross-border assaults against the Kabul government</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (The Taliban is more popular in Pakistan than in Afghanistan). </span><u>India, the South Asian giant, is also nervous about Afghanistan's future, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">which could become another area o</span>f competition - or <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">conflict - between Islamabad and New Delhi</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, beyond the prevailing tinderbox of contested Kashmir. India and Pakistan have come to blows (and near-blows) a number of times since their 1947 independence from one another. The stakes are higher now that both have nukes. </span><u>Succeeding in Afghanistan is also important to containing Iranian influence in the region, which has been surging not only across the Middle East, but into South and Central Asia, too. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">It's also fundamental to American leadership in the world</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><u>The hallmark of good <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">human terrain</span> fieldwork <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">lies in the reduction in the number of lethal operations, casualties inflicted</span> and received</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. By doing our research, both primary and secondary, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">we were able to</span></u> <u>directly or indirectly conceptualize and i<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nfluence virtually all of our brigade’s problem sets and provide nonlethal options to resolve them.</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> My teammates and I were heavily involved with helping to write the brigade’s campaign plan. Every session always began with the Plans Officer and/or the Line of Effort (LOE) Chief asking what “does right look like for the Iraqis in our OE [operating environment] and how do we get them there?” Our job was to answer that question by taking our research and packaging it in a way that military personnel could easily and quickly digest. When we did this, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">we were able to ensure that the Army focused on </span></u><u>the three most important aspects of<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> COIN</span> that I outlined above. This all translates into <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">fewer injured or killed locals and,</span> of course, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">fewer injured or killed American</span> and Coalition <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Forces</span>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">We do not do targeting</span>, intelligence collection, or engage in any part of lethal and kinetic operations,</u> <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">although we do, like everyone, retain the right to self-defense. Contrary to the program’s most vocal critics, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">we are not using social science methodology to enable the Army to kill more Iraqis</span></u> <u>and Afghanis.</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> In fact, one of our biggest successes was getting the Shriner’s Hospital in Boston, as well as a local Boston charity, to agree to treat a burned Iraqi boy and house and feed his family pro bono. When our Commander decided it was better for Iraqis to treat him we worked with a sister team in another OE to facilitate his access to treatment within the Iraqi Ministry of Health system. T</span><u>his goes right to another point on terminology: <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The Army calls everything they engage in “targeting.”</span> For instance, when the Commander goes to have dinner with a sheikh, that is referred to as targeting. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This can easily lead to confusion by those who do not work with the military</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, so we have been encouraging them to use the terms “engage” and “engagement” instead of “target” and “targeting” when engaging in nonlethal operations</span><u>. This is, actually, more than just a matter of semantics<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. By changing the way the military talks about nonlethal operations, we change the way they think about them, which further promotes nonlethal options</span>.</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> In a nutshell, we are using our methodological skills to help the Army learn how to achieve their goals without having to use force. As someone with extensive methods training, in five different disciplines, and who has taught research methods, I can think of no more noble use than to use these skills to preserve life whenever possible. How many research and teaching academics can say the same about how they use their skills? </span><u>There is one set of related items that Dr. González mentions in his interview answers that I would like to address here</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Despite what some personnel from the Foreign Military Studies Office wrote, we are not a “CORDs for the twenty-first century.”</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> CORDs, a Vietnam-era initiative, was a full-fledged counterinsurgency program, utilizing both military and civilian advisors who lived with the local populations that they were working with and trained them on all aspects of government and governance. Moreover, they were training these populations in regards to stabilization and reconstruction. Importantly, because the CORDs personnel actually lived among the host nation population, they lived and died with them, so, when necessary, they fought with them. Human Terrain personnel do not live with the host nation population, nor do we fight with them. Rather we live on the military bases, go out with a military security escort, and return home to base after our engagements.

Project Phoenix, a separate Vietnam-era program, which too often is confused with, or mistakenly rolled into CORDs, is also not an applicable historical analog to HTS. This was a program advised by the Central Intelligence Agency and it largely involved Vietnamese trying to root out VietCong political cadres with the help of a small number of civilian advisors – mostly law enforcement personnel, not researchers.

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Inside Higher Ed recently published an interview with Roberto </span><u>González</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, an associate professor of anthropology at San Jose State University, on the Human Terrain System (HTS), a U.S. Army program in which social scientists are embedded with military units. The questions were thoughtful and well asked, but the </span><u>answers bear little resemblance to the work I conducted as a field social scientist deployed by HTS.</u> <u>I would like to</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> explain what the goals of the program are, what we do, and why we do it, as well as try to </span><u>clarify misperceptions that arise from unfamiliarity with military culture, terminology, planning and practice. My job in Iraq was to represent the population to promote nonlethal planning and operations.</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> When a mission is conceptualized, when course of action recommendations have to be made, when decisive points are identified for the commander, my job is to present what the population wants and expects, how it will react, and at all times promote nonlethal options. This last portion, </span><u>the promotion of nonlethal options, is of exceeding importance for two reasons. The first is the nature of my mission, and the overall mission of the HTS – we have an ethical responsibility to bring quality socio-cultural information and nonlethal possibilities to the commander’s attention. This is related to the second imperative, which goes to the heart of Counterinsurgency (COIN) doctrine. The three most important elements of COIN are 1) to empower the lowest level (the population), 2) to work from the bottom up (the population) and 3) nonlethal operations accomplish more than lethal ones.</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> In a nutshell, my job is to keep the population, the effects of military operations on the population, and nonlethal options front and center in the commander and command staff’s awareness. There are a number of ways that an HTT can keep the population and nonlethal options on the front burner. In the case of my team, we used very standard research and analysis methods to get at both primary and secondary open source data. </span><u>At all times we endeavored to engage in best practices, both in terms of methodology and ethics.</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> We essentially used four basic methods of collection: archival, process observation, participant observation, and semi-structured elite level interviews. Our archival research had three different purposes. The first was to do our homework about our brigade’s operating environment before we deployed with them to Iraq. The second was to then go through the information on the population already archived by the brigade that we were replacing. The final component was to keep abreast of political, social, religious, and economic events in our operating environment, Iraq, the Middle East, and in some cases, the U.S., which could affect the host nation population that we, and the Army, had to interact with on a daily basis. We also process and participant observed a wide variety of meetings and events. At all of these we identified ourselves fully, explained who we were, what we were doing (serving as socio-cultural advisors for the Army), and asked for permission to ask questions and to attribute or not. At all times we used standard, basic protocols for conducting process and participant observation. When conducting our elite level interviews, part of a four-month-long tribal study and history, we used formal, documented informed consent. The documents were prepared in English, translated into Arabic, and the interview subject retained one copy and I, as research director, retained one. When requested, anonymity was granted. The Army personnel we worked with never had access to these, to the internal ethical review process of the team, or to the raw information of someone’s identity when anonymity was requested. In fact, because of the social science backgrounds of many of the officers we dealt with daily, they not only understood the protocols, but respected them. Moreover, on one occasion the protocols actually allowed me to provide necessary information to a battalion commander. The sheikh I had just interviewed had consented to my attributing his information, which allowed me to answer the commander’s questions without feeling like I was boxed in. Ethical and methodological best practices actually enabled me to properly do my job. On another occasion, information that I collected was useful in helping the battalion commander, as I provided information that presented a set of nonlethal options for resolving a problem regarding a local mosque. The results of this four-month study, in combination with data acquired from engaging in participant observation with everyday Iraqis, as well as internally displaced persons, provide very important insight and findings regarding Iraqi tribal behavior, Iraqi politics, religion, rule of law, as well as the stabilization and reconstruction that is being undertaken. The results are being prepared for peer review and publication. The information we obtained was also packaged and provided to our brigade, the battalions, maneuver companies, as well as the embedded Provincial Reconstruction Team and the U.S. Department of State/U.S. Embassy</span><u>. Had this information been available when Operation Iraqi Freedom was conceptualized, there would have been a greater chance of the initial stabilization and reconstruction being done in a better informed, more productive, and less lethal manner.</u> </span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">The Perils of Incomplete Knowledge </span><u>DOD yearns for cultural knowledge, but anthropologists en masse, bound by their own ethical code and sunk in a mire of postmodernism, are unlikely to contribute much of value to reshaping national security policy or practice. Yet, if anthropologists remain disengaged, who will provide the relevant subject matter expertise?</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> As Anna Simons, an anthropologist who teaches at the Naval Postgraduate School, points out: &quot;</span><u>If anthropologists want to put their heads in the sand and not assist, then</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> who will </span><u>the military</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, the CIA, and other agencies turn to for information? They'</span><u>ll</u> <u>turn to people who will give them the kind of information that should make anthropologists want to rip their hair out</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> because the information won't be nearly as directly connected to what's going on on the local landscape.&quot;60 Regardless of whether anthropologists decide to enter the national-security arena, </span><u>cultural information will inevitably be used as the basis of military operations and public policy. And, if anthropologists refuse to contribute</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, how reliable will that information be? </span><u>The result of using incomplete &quot;bad&quot; anthropology is, invariably, failed operations and failed policy.</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> In a May 2004 New Yorker article, &quot;The Gray Zone: How a Secret Pentagon Program Came to Abu Ghraib,&quot; Seymour </span><u>Hersh notes that</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Raphael Patai's </span><u>1973 study of Arab culture and psychology</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, The Arab Mind, </span><u>was the basis of the military's understanding of the psychological vulnerabilities of Arabs, particularly to sexual shame and humiliation</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">.61 Patai says: &quot;The segregation of the sexes, the veiling of the women . . . , and all the other minute rules that govern and restrict contact between men and women, have the effect of making sex a prime mental preoccupation in the Arab world.&quot; Apparently, the goal of photographing the sexual humiliation was to blackmail Iraqi victims into becoming informants against the insurgency. To prevent the dissemination of photos to family and friends, it was believed Iraqi men would do almost anything.62 As Bernard Brodie said of the French Army in 1914, </span><u>&quot;This was neither the first nor the last time that bad anthropology contributed to bad strategy.&quot; Using sexual humiliation to blackmail Iraqi men into becoming informants could never have worked as a strategy since it only destroys honor,</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> and for Iraqis, lost honor requires its restoration through the appeasement of blood. This concept is well developed in Iraqi culture, and there is even a specific Arabic word for it: al-sharaf, upholding one's manly honor. The alleged use of Patai's book as the basis of the psychological torment at </span><u>Abu Ghraib</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, devoid of any understanding of the broader context of Iraqi culture, </span><u>demonstrates the folly of using decontextualized culture as the basis of policy.</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">63 </span></span><br />

Anthropologists began to reinvent their discipline</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, as demonstrated by Kathleen Gough's 1968 article, Anthropology: Child of Imperialism, followed by Dell Hymes' 1972 anthology, Reinventing Anthropology, and culminating in editor Talal Asad's Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter.17 Rejecting anthropology's status as the handmaiden of colonialism, </span><u>anthropologists refused to &quot;collaborate&quot; with the powerful, instead vying to represent the interests of indigenous peoples</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> engaged in neocolonial struggles. In the words of Gayatri Chakravorti Spivak, anthropologists would now speak for the &quot;subaltern.&quot; Thus began a systematic interrogation of the contemporary state of the discipline as well as of the colonial circumstances from which it emerged. </span><u>Armed with critical hermeneutics, frequently backed up by self-reflexive neo- Marxism, anthropology began a brutal process of self-flagellation,</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> to a degree almost unimaginable to anyone outside the discipline.18 </span><u>The turn toward postmodernism within anthropology exacerbated the tendency toward self-flagellation, with the central goal being &quot;the deconstruction of the centralized, logocentric master narratives</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> of European culture.&quot; </span><u>This movement away from descriptive ethnography has produced some of the worst writing imaginable.</u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> For example, Cultural Anthropology, one of the most respected anthropology journals in the United States, commonly publishes such incomprehensible articles as &quot;Recovering True Selves in the Electro-Spiritual Field of Universal Love&quot; and &quot;Material Consumers, Fabricating Subjects: Perplexity, Global Connectivity Discourses, and Transnational Feminist Research.&quot;19 </span></span><br />

<em><u>China seems to have concluded that the United States will go ahead with some form of national missile defense, and that it is no longer an option<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for China to build a strong front with Russia to extract a heavy political cost from the United States for doing so, much less </span>to stop the program<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That being the case, China has nothing to gain from suggesting publicly that the program is a great threat to Chinese interests, and every incentive to discount the effort as a pointless diversion from the United States’ real priorities. The </span>Chinese<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> are clearly opposed to potential U.S.-Japanese missile defense cooperation. However, this </span>opposition is in the context of general concern about an expanded Japanese role in Asia-Pacific security overall, rather than specific objections to Japan having a missile defense as such<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Not surprisingly, </span>given China’s focus on Taiwan specifically and on Japan as a resurgent regional power generally, the most pointed Chinese criticism of the Japanese effort was that a Japanese defense would be interlinked with the United States and Taiwan to form a regional ballistic missile defense system, directed<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not at North Korea or other ‘rogue states,’ but </span>at China<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Predictably, </span>the strongest Chinese concern about missile defense is related to possible U.S. support for a system that would defend Taiwan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Any U.S. decision to sell Taiwan a missile defense system, much less to cooperate in its installation and operation, would likely set off a major crisis in U.S.-Chinese relations. Significantly, these objections are not related primarily to the prospect of Taiwan having some defense, but to missile defense cooperation as a symbol of renewed U.S.-ROC military cooperation. This perception is being fed by those on Taiwan who see missile defense as a test of U.S. resolve. </span>China regards cooperation on ballistic missile defense as in a separate and even more objectionable category than other U.S. military sales to Taiwan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the Chinese view, all military sales of any significance violate what China views as President Reagan’s commitment in the 1981 communiqué gradually to reduce and eventually to eliminate such sales. They also maintain that missile defense cooperation would necessarily entail such extensive and close exchange of data and operational linkages as to amount to a de facto revival of the U.S.-ROC security alliance, which, as previously mentioned, the United States agreed to discontinue as part of the 1979 arrangements for normalization. As such, </span>missile defense cooperation is unique in that it violates both the 1979 and 1981 undertakings, as interpreted by the PRC. China shares with the United States and its regional allies, including Japan<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and South Korea, </span>an interest in preventing North Korea from acquiring mature missile and nuclear weapons capabilities. These countries also share an interest in a stable and constructive U.S.-Chinese strategic relationship. U.S. missile defense policy needs to recognize these broad common interests. Some degree of negative Chinese reaction to U.S. missile defense efforts is unavoidable. However, China has no “right” to unchallenged missile dominance in the region. And in any case, the actual capability of defenses now under development will be very limited against the missile capability, both intercontinental and regional, that China will have by the time the defenses are operational. U.S. policy on missile defense cooperation in the region should therefore combine firmness about U.S. commitments to its alliance relationships with a sustained effort to maintain a constructive, non-confrontational relationship with China. Multi-level dialogue and transparency, as well as modulation of rhetoric, will be key elements in such an effort<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Architecture Decisions on the “real” Chinese response in terms of military programs to a U.S. missile defense will be made in highly restricted government and party circles and manifested publicly only as the actions decided upon work their way through development, testing, and deployment. One likely element of the Chinese response is a greater commitment to a more survivable, and probably more numerous, intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force. However, given that the effort to develop such a capability began long ago, and that the originally planned pace and scale of that effort is unknown, </span>the outside world may<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> quite possibly </span>not know for a long time, if ever, how strongly U.S. missile defense programs affected Chinese ICBM modernization. It would<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> appear to </span>be in the U.S. interest to provide as much transparency as possible regarding U.S. missile defense programs so that China is not encouraged to hasten its modernization programs, since the U.S. systems<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – as planned – </span>are not intended to handle the sophisticated Chinese threat and would have only the most limited capability to do so<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The United States should consider the potential of an arrangement to share early warning information with China, on the model of existing cooperation with Russia</u></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em><u>.</u></em></span><br />

<strong>Plan causes independent Japanese BMD</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Rubinstein, 2007</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Center for Pacific Asia Studies at Stockholm University (Gregg A., “US-Japan Missile Defense Cooperation: Current Status, Future Prospects,” September 5, Stockholm Journal of East Asian Studies, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.japanconsidered.com/OccasionalPapers/Rubinstein%20USJA%20BMD%20article%20090507.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.japanconsidered.com/OccasionalPapers/Rubinstein%20USJA%20BMD%20article%20090507.pdf</a>) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Meanwhile </span><u>Japanese officials</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often </span><u>speak of the need for an “independent” missile defense capability</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Does this mean ensuring that Japan retains operational control over use of its BMD forces? To what extent is concern for independent control entangled in the Japanese government’s increasingly untenable ban on collective defense operations?31 Does thinking behind an independent capability go further to support development of indigenous systems that may – or may not – have necessary interoperability with US counterparts?32 </span><u>Consideration of such questions suggests two possible paths to future US-Japan interaction on missile defense</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> systems and operations: </span><u>1. Mutually supporting</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> US and Japanese </span><u>capabilities based on</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: • Resolution of policy issues affecting joint operations; • </span><u>Interconnected command and control</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">systems with timely information sharing; • </span><u>Jointly developed and produced hardware</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (weapons and sensors) supported by interoperable software; • BMD platforms (ships, aircraft, satellites) that share jointly developed technologies; • Sustained joint planning, training and exercises; • Expansion of missile defense activities to other regional partners. There has already been notable progress toward this goal – more than many observers might have thought possible just a few years ago. However, further progress is by no means assured. All of the activities listed above will require continued policy vision as well as effective program management to work through ever-present budgetary, bureaucratic, and perhaps political obstacles. </span><u>2. Cooperative – but not joint – missile defense</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> capabilities: • Functional interoperability between BMD forces, but limited information sharing; • M</span><u>ore emphasis on “independent” Japanese capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and operations; • Case-by-case cooperation on acquisition of missile defense systems, wi</span><u>th substantial Japanese effort to develop and procure indigenous systems</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; • Regional BMD cooperation will be more difficult to implement This is the ‘default’ path to future US-Japan missile defense cooperation. Here, all parties would proceed on established tracks to implement current programs, accomplishment of which would in itself be a substantial achievement. However, political and bureaucratic agendas limit the extent of future integration on BMD activities. Budgetary problems, or resistance to compromising national programs, will make some tasks simply ‘too hard’ to see through. </span><br />

<strong>That is comparatively more destabilizing</strong><br />

<br />
<u>On the other side of the equation, Japan’s neighbors are likely to regard an independent Japanese BMD with even greater concern</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For some of Japan’s neighbors, such as South Korea, a Japanese capability firmly linked to that of the United States would seem more desirable. China, on the other hand, opposes both deployment options. </span><br />
<br />
<strong>Independent Japanese BMD would trade off with SLOC protection capabilities by taking up ships</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A commitment to a major investment in a sea-based defense also has implications for interservice rivalries. By definition, </span><u>a sea-based system would be procured and operated by the Maritime Self-Defense Force</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the de facto Japanese navy. 14 If commitment to it meant a shift in resources to the navy and away from the Ground Self-Defense Force, which has traditionally been the most influential and powerful of the services, that service could be expected to oppose the project. Some security observers in Japan argue that such a shift in allocation among the services is long overdue, 15 but acknowledge that such changes are never easy. On the other hand, </span><u>if the substantial cost of the system were to come out of an essentially unchanged navy share of the total defense budget, the navy could face serious internal priority issues</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In particular, Japan’s </span><u>Aegis ships have hitherto had as their primary mission the defense against air and submarine threat of Japan’s sea lines, an essential element in the Japanese economy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the traditional priority mission of its post-war navy. </span><u>Converting the ships</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (or configuring the ones yet to be produced) </span><u>to missile defense could result in a diminished commitment to</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the sea lines of communication (</span><u>SLOC) protection</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> role. While several more Aegis-class ships remain to be built, the force is configured for the SLOC protection role – and expanding the total purchase would require more hard-to-recruit-andretain crews, quite apart from its effect on other aspects of the naval effort. </span><br />

<br />
<u>Asia's SLOCs connect the Middle East and the Indian Ocean with Southeast Asia, Southeast Asia with Northeast Asia, and Northeast Asia with North Amer­ica<strong>. Free and open SLOCs</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, therefore, </span><strong><u>are vital to the countries of the region</u></strong><u>. They are vital because many Asian states are trade-oriented and a significant and growing percentage of this trade is carried in ships</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In addition, </span><u>Asian states are major shipping nations in terms of tonnage and volume of trade handled at their ports</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span><u>Asian states import significant quantities of energy, food­stuffs, and minerals.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(See Swinnerton 1994; Weeks 1998; Lee 1998: 3-4; Song 1999: 12; U.S. EIA 2000; Ji 2000: z-5, 9-11; Kim 2000: 35.) Finally, </span><u>Asian navies need free and open SLOCs to perform their missions such as securing disputed islands and maritime spaces</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
<strong>That’s key to the global economy</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Swaine, 98</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Michael, et al, Senior Associate and Co-Director of the China Program at the Carnegie Endowment For International Peace, </span><u>Sources of Conflict in the 21st Century</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, p. 54-55)</span><br />
<br />
<u>Such growth rates suggest that by</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the year </span><u>2010, the East Asian region alone will account <strong>for over 34 percent of the world’s total output</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, with Western Europe and North America following with 26 percent and 25 percent respectively. If the output of the South Asian subregion is added to the East Asian total, the share of Asian output rises even more—closer to 40 percent—relative to Western Europe and North America. The data for world trade show similar Asian dominance. </span><u>East Asia alone is expected to contribute almost 40 percent of the world’s trade</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, with Western Europe and North America following with about 37 percent and 20 percent, respectively.12 This high sustained growth will continue to be fueled by high rates of domestic savings, increased intra-Asian economic integration, increasing investment in infrastructure and human capital, a decreasing rate of population growth, and continuing export-led growth. Second, </span><u>the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> wealth and </span><u>prosperity of the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> United States </span><u>will remain dependent on continued linkages with the Asian economies. The Asian continent</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> today </span><u>represents the <strong>most important locus of American economic engagement</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The 1993 data for merchandise trade, for example, show that the United States imports over 42 percent of its goods from the Asia-Pacific region, in contrast to about 20 percent from Europe, about 19 percent from Canada, about 12 percent from the rest of North America, and about 5 percent from the rest of the world. The story is similarly revealing where merchandise exports are concerned. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for about 30 percent of American merchandise exports; Europe accounts for about 25 percent, Canada for about 21 percent, the rest of the Americas for about 16 percent, with the rest of the world accounting for about 5.6 percent of the total. When trade in invisibles and services is considered, a similar picture emerges: the Asia-Pacific region remains the single most important destination for the United States, a fact reflected by the data in Tables 5 and 6 below. </span><br />

<u>No political decision has been made to go forward with such a program.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is a truism that in </span><u>Japan even more than in other countries</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a military program like this with important policy and financial implications </span><u>will only proceed if it commands broad support. Missile defense already has strong support in traditional conservative and security-minded circles</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, 10 whereas some traditional left-wing and pacifist groups will never support it. Concern about proliferation and the potential of new direct threats to Japan, as well as a modest move toward a more active Japanese international security role, 11 mean that commitment to a missile defense for Japan is not impossible. However, broad elements of Japanese public opinion – and powerful forces in the media – maintain a fundamental aversion to a greater Japanese military role. </span><u>For missile defense to become a serious element in Japanese military programs, therefore, there remains, we were told, a large set of skeptical groups whose support must be won</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<u>As long as catastrophic possibilities exist in that nation, so do the unprecedented threats to</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> US and </span><u>international security</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Experts differ as to which danger is the gravest--<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">proliferation of Russia's</span> enormous stockpile of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nuclear, chemical and biological materials</span>; ill-maintained nuclear reactors</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> on land and on decommissioned </span><u>submarines</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">; </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">an impaired early-warning system controlling missiles on hair-trigger alert</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">; or the first-ever civil war in a shattered superpower, the terror-ridden Chechen conflict. But no one should doubt that together they constitute a much greater constant threat than any the United States faced during the Soviet era. Nor is a catastrophe involving weapons of mass destruction the only danger in what remains the world's largest territorial country. Nearly a quarter of the planet's people live on Russia's borders, among them conflicting ethnic and religious groups. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Any instability in Russia could easily spread to a crucial and exceedingly volatile part of the world</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 5.0pt;">. </span></u><span style="font-size: 5.0pt;"> There is another, perhaps more likely, possibility. Petrodollars may bring Russia long-term stability, but on the basis of growing authoritarianism and xenophobic nationalism. Those ominous factors derive primarily not from Russia's lost superpower status (or Putin's KGB background), as the US press regularly misinforms readers, but from so many lost and damaged lives at home since 1991. Often called the &quot;Weimar scenario,&quot; this outcome probably would not be truly fascist, but it would be a Russia possessing weapons of mass destruction and large proportions of the world's oil and natural gas, even more hostile to the West than was its Soviet predecessor. How has the US government responded to these unprecedented perils? It doesn't require a degree in international relations or media punditry to understand that the first principle of policy toward post-Communist Russia must follow the Hippocratic injunction: Do no harm! Do nothing to undermine its fragile stability, nothing to dissuade the Kremlin from giving first priority to repairing the nation's crumbling infrastructures, nothing to cause it to rely more heavily on its stockpiles of superpower weapons instead of reducing them, nothing to make Moscow uncooperative with the West in those joint pursuits. Everything else in that savaged country is of far less consequence. Since the early 1990s Washington has simultaneously conducted, under Democrats and Republicans, two fundamentally different policies toward post-Soviet Russia--one decorative and outwardly reassuring, the other real and exceedingly reckless. The decorative policy, which has been taken at face value in the United States, at least until recently, professes to have replaced America's previous cold war intentions with a generous relationship of &quot;strategic partnership and friendship.&quot; The public image of this approach has featured happy-talk meetings between American and Russian presidents, first &quot;Bill and Boris&quot; (Clinton and Yeltsin), then &quot;George and Vladimir.&quot;</span> <u>The real US policy has been</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> very different--a relentless, winner-take-all </span><u>exploitation of Russia's</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> post-1991 </span><u>weakness</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Accompanied by broken American promises, condescending lectures and demands for unilateral concessions, it has been even more aggressive and uncompromising than was Washington's approach to Soviet Communist Russia. Consider its defining elements as they have unfolded--with fulsome support in both American political parties, influential newspapers and policy think tanks--since the early 1990s: §_A </span><u>growing military encirclement of Russia,</u> <span style="font-size: 5.0pt;">on and near its borders, by US and NATO bases, which are already ensconced or being planned in at least half the fourteen other former Soviet republics, from the Baltics and Ukraine to Georgia, Azerbaijan and the new states of Central Asia. The result is a US-built reverse iron curtain and the remilitarization of American-Russian relations. §_A tacit (and closely related) US denial that Russia has any legitimate national interests outside its own territory, even in ethnically akin or contiguous former republics such as Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia. How else to explain, to take a bellwether example, the thinking of Richard Holbrooke, Democratic would-be Secretary of State? While roundly condemning the Kremlin for promoting a pro-Moscow government in neighboring Ukraine, where Russia has centuries of shared linguistic, marital, religious, economic and security ties, Holbrooke declares that far-away Slav nation part of &quot;our core zone of security.&quot; §_Even more, a presumption that Russia does not have full sovereignty within its own borders, as expressed by constant US interventions in Moscow's internal affairs since 1992. They have included an on-site crusade by swarms of American &quot;advisers,&quot; particularly during the 1990s, to direct Russia's &quot;transition&quot; from Communism; endless missionary sermons from afar, often couched in threats, on how that nation should and should not organize its political and economic systems; and active support for Russian anti-Kremlin groups, some associated with hated Yeltsin-era oligarchs. That interventionary impulse has now grown even into suggestions that Putin be overthrown by the kind of US-backed &quot;color revolutions&quot; carried out since 2003 in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, and attempted this year in Belarus. Thus, while mainstream editorial pages increasingly call the Russian president &quot;thug,&quot; &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;Saddam Hussein,&quot; one of the Carnegie Endowment's several Washington crusaders assures us of &quot;Putin's weakness&quot; and vulnerability to &quot;regime change.&quot; (Do proponents of &quot;democratic regime change&quot; in Russia care that it might mean destabilizing a nuclear state?)</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> §_</span><u>Underpinning these components of</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">the real </span><u>US policy are familiar cold war double standards condemning Moscow for doing what Washington does--such as seeking allies and military bases in former Soviet republics</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt;">using its assets (oil and gas in Russia's case) as aid to friendly governments and regulating foreign money in its political life. More broadly, when NATO expands to Russia's front and back doorsteps, gobbling up former Soviet-bloc members and republics, it is &quot;fighting terrorism&quot; and &quot;protecting new states&quot;; when Moscow protests, it is engaging in &quot;cold war thinking.&quot; When Washington meddles in the politics of Georgia and Ukraine, it is &quot;promoting democracy&quot;; when the Kremlin does so, it is &quot;neoimperialism.&quot; And not to forget the historical background: When in the 1990s the US-supported Yeltsin overthrew Russia's elected Parliament and Constitutional Court by force, gave its national wealth and television networks to Kremlin insiders, imposed a constitution without real constraints on executive power and rigged elections, it was &quot;democratic reform&quot;; when Putin continues that process, it is &quot;authoritarianism.&quot; §_Finally, the United States is attempting, by exploiting Russia's weakness, to acquire the nuclear superiority it could not achieve during the Soviet era. That is the essential meaning of two major steps taken by the Bush Administration in 2002, both against Moscow's strong wishes. One was the Administration's unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, freeing it to try to create a system capable of destroying incoming missiles and thereby the capacity to launch a nuclear first strike without fear of retaliation. The other was pressuring the Kremlin to sign an ultimately empty nuclear weapons reduction agreement requiring no actual destruction of weapons and indeed allowing development of new ones; providing for no verification; and permitting unilateral withdrawal before the specified reductions are required. The extraordinarily anti-Russian nature of these policies casts serious doubt on two American official and media axioms: that the recent &quot;chill&quot; in US-Russian relations has been caused by Putin's behavior at home and abroad, and that the cold war ended fifteen years ago. The first axiom is false, the second only half true: The cold war ended in Moscow, but not in Washington, as is clear from a brief look back. The last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power in 1985 with heretical &quot;New Thinking&quot; that proposed not merely to ease but to actually abolish the decades-long cold war. His proposals triggered a fateful struggle in Washington (and Moscow) between policy-makers who wanted to seize the historic opportunity and those who did not. President Ronald Reagan decided to meet Gorbachev at least part of the way, as did his successor, the first President George Bush. As a result, in December 1989, at a historic summit meeting at Malta, Gorbachev and Bush declared the cold war over. (That extraordinary agreement evidently has been forgotten; thus we have the New York Times recently asserting that the US-Russian relationship today &quot;is far better than it was 15 years ago.&quot;) Declarations alone, however, could not terminate decades of warfare attitudes. Even when Bush was agreeing to end the cold war in 1989-91, many of his top advisers, like many members of the US political elite and media, strongly resisted. (I witnessed that rift on the eve of Malta, when I was asked to debate the issue in front of Bush and his divided foreign policy team.) Proof came with the Soviet breakup in December 1991: US officials and the media immediately presented the purported &quot;end of the cold war&quot; not as a mutual Soviet-American decision, which it certainly was, but as a great American victory and Russian defeat.</span> <u>That</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(now standard) </span><u>triumphalist narrative is the primary reason the cold war was quickly revived</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">--not in Moscow a decade later by Putin but in Washington in the early 1990s, when the Clinton Administration made two epically unwise decisions. One was to treat post-Communist Russia as a defeated nation that was expected to replicate America's domestic practices and bow to its foreign policies. It required, behind the facade of the Clinton-Yeltsin &quot;partnership and friendship&quot; (as Clinton's top &quot;Russia hand,&quot; Strobe Talbott, later confirmed), telling Yeltsin &quot;here's some more shit for your face&quot; and Moscow's &quot;submissiveness.&quot; From that triumphalism grew the still-ongoing interventions in Moscow's internal affairs and the abiding notion that Russia has no autonomous rights at home or abroad. Clinton's other unwise decision was to break the Bush Administration's promise to Soviet Russia in 1990-91 not to expand NATO &quot;one inch to the east&quot; and instead begin its expansion to Russia's borders. From that profound act of bad faith, followed by others, came the dangerously provocative military encirclement of Russia and growing Russian suspicions of US intentions. Thus, while American journalists and even scholars insist that &quot;the cold war has indeed vanished&quot; and that concerns about a new one are &quot;silly,&quot; Russians across the political spectrum now believe that in Washington &quot;</span><u>the cold war did not end&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and, still more, that &quot;</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the US is imposing a new cold war on Russia</span>.&quot;</u> <span style="font-size: 5.0pt;">That ominous view is being greatly exacerbated by Washington's ever-growing &quot;anti-Russian fatwa,&quot; as a former Reagan appointee terms it. This year it includes a torrent of official and media statements denouncing Russia's domestic and foreign policies, vowing to bring more of its neighbors into NATO and urging Bush to boycott the G-8 summit to be chaired by Putin in St. Petersburg in July; a call by would-be Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain for &quot;very harsh&quot; measures against Moscow; Congress's pointed refusal to repeal a Soviet-era restriction on trade with Russia; the Pentagon's revival of old rumors that Russian intelligence gave Saddam Hussein information endangering US troops; and comments by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, echoing the regime-changers, urging Russians, &quot;if necessary, to change their government.&quot; For its part, the White House deleted from its 2006 National Security Strategy the long-professed US-Russian partnership, backtracked on agreements to help Moscow join the World Trade Organization and adopted sanctions against Belarus, the Slav former republic most culturally akin to Russia and with whom the Kremlin is negotiating a new union state. Most significant, in May it dispatched Vice President Cheney to an anti-Russian conference in former Soviet Lithuania, now a NATO member, to denounce the Kremlin and make clear it is not &quot;a strategic partner and a trusted friend,&quot; thereby ending fifteen years of official pretense. More astonishing is a Council on Foreign Relations &quot;task force report&quot; on Russia, co-chaired by Democratic presidential aspirant John Edwards, issued in March. The &quot;nonpartisan&quot; council's reputed moderation and balance are nowhere in evidence. An unrelenting exercise in double standards, the report blames all the &quot;disappointments&quot; in US-Russian relations solely on &quot;Russia's wrong direction&quot; under Putin--from meddling in the former Soviet republics and backing Iran to conflicts over NATO, energy politics and the &quot;rollback of Russian democracy.&quot; Strongly implying that Bush has been too soft on Putin, the council report flatly rejects partnership with Moscow as &quot;not a realistic prospect.&quot; It calls instead for &quot;selective cooperation&quot; and &quot;selective opposition,&quot; depending on which suits US interests, and, in effect, Soviet-era containment. Urging more Western intervention in Moscow's political affairs, the report even reserves for Washington the right to reject Russia's future elections and leaders as &quot;illegitimate.&quot; An article in the council's influential journal Foreign Affairs menacingly adds that the United States is quickly &quot;attaining nuclear primacy&quot; and the ability &quot;to destroy the long-range nuclear arsenals of Russia or China with a first strike.&quot;</span> <u>Every consequence of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> bipartisan American </span><u>cold war against</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> post-Communist </span><u>Russia <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">has exacerbated the dangers inherent in the Soviet breakup</span> mentioned above</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The crusade to transform Russia during the 1990s, with its disastrous &quot;shock therapy&quot; economic measures and resulting antidemocratic acts, further destabilized the country, fostering an oligarchical system that plundered the state's wealth, deprived essential infrastructures of investment, impoverished the people and nurtured dangerous corruption. In the process, it discredited Western-style reform, generated mass anti-Americanism where there had been almost none--only 5 percent of Russians surveyed in May thought the United States was a &quot;friend&quot;--and eviscerated the once-influential pro-American faction in Kremlin and electoral politics. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Military encirclement</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, the Bush Administration's striving for nuclear supremacy and today's renewed US intrusions into Russian politics </span><u>are having even worse consequences.</u> <u>They <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have provoked the Kremlin into undertaking its own conventional and nuclear buildup</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span><u>relying more rather than less on compromised mechanisms</u> <u>of control and maintenance,</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> while continuing to invest miserly sums in the country's decaying economic base and human resources. </span><u>The same American policies have also <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">caused Moscow to cooperate less</span> rather than more <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in</span> existing US-funded <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">programs</span> to reduce the multiple risks represented by Russia's materials of mass destruction and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to prevent <strong>accidental nuclear war</strong></span>.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> More generally, they have inspired a new Kremlin ideology of &quot;emphasizing our sovereignty&quot; that is increasingly nationalistic, intolerant of foreign-funded NGOs as &quot;fifth columns&quot; and reliant on anti-Western views of the &quot;patriotic&quot; Russian intelligentsia and the Orthodox Church. Moscow's responses abroad have also been the opposite of what Washington policy-makers should want. Interpreting US-backed &quot;color revolutions&quot; as a quest for military outposts on Russia's borders, the Kremlin now opposes pro-democracy movements in former Soviet republics more than ever, while supporting the most authoritarian regimes in the region, from Belarus to Uzbekistan. Meanwhile, Moscow is forming a political, economic and military &quot;strategic partnership&quot; with China, lending support to Iran and other anti-American governments in the Middle East and already putting surface-to-air missiles back in Belarus, in effect Russia's western border with NATO. If American policy and Russia's predictable countermeasures continue to develop into a full-scale cold war, several new factors could make it even more dangerous than was its predecessor. Above all, the growing presence of Western bases and US-backed governments in the former Soviet republics has moved the &quot;front lines&quot; of the conflict, in the alarmed words of a Moscow newspaper, from Germany to Russia's &quot;near abroad.&quot; As a &quot;hostile ring tightens around the Motherland,&quot; in the view of former Prime Minister Evgeny Primakov, many different Russians see a mortal threat. Putin's chief political deputy, Vladislav Surkov, for example, sees the &quot;enemy...at the gates,&quot; and the novelist and Soviet-era dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn sees the &quot;complete encirclement of Russia and then the loss of its sovereignty.&quot; The risks of direct military conflict could therefore be greater than ever. Protesting overflights by NATO aircraft, a Russian general has already warned, &quot;If they violate our borders, they should be shot down.&quot; Worsening the geopolitical factor are radically different American and Russian self-perceptions. By the mid-1960s the US-Soviet cold war relationship had acquired a significant degree of stability because the two superpowers, perceiving a stalemate, began to settle for political and military &quot;parity.&quot; Today, however, the United States, the self-proclaimed &quot;only superpower,&quot; has a far more expansive view of its international entitlements and possibilities. Moscow, on the other hand, feels weaker and more vulnerable than it did before 1991. And in that asymmetry lies the potential for a less predictable cold war relationship between the two still fully armed nuclear states. There is also a new psychological factor. Because the unfolding cold war is undeclared, it is already laden with feelings of betrayal and mistrust on both sides. Having welcomed Putin as Yeltsin's chosen successor and offered him its conception of &quot;partnership and friendship,&quot; Washington now feels deceived by Putin's policies. According to two characteristic commentaries in the Washington Post, Bush had a &quot;well-intentioned Russian policy,&quot; but &quot;a Russian autocrat...betrayed the American's faith.&quot; Putin's Kremlin, however, has been reacting largely to a decade of broken US promises and Yeltsin's boozy compliance. Thus Putin's declaration four years ago, paraphrased on Russian radio: &quot;The era of Russian geopolitical concessions [is] coming to an end.&quot; (Looking back, he remarked bitterly that Russia has been &quot;constantly deceived.&quot;) Still worse, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the emerging cold war lacks the substantive negotiations and cooperation</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, known as détente</span><u>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that constrained the previous one</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Behind the lingering facade, a well-informed Russian tells us, &quot;dialogue is almost nonexistent.&quot; </span><u>It is especially true in regard to nuclear weapons.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Bush Administration's abandonment of the ABM treaty and real reductions, its decision to build an antimissile shield, and talk of pre-emptive war and nuclear strikes have all but abolished long-established US-Soviet agreements that have kept the nuclear peace for nearly fifty years. Indeed, according to a report, Bush's National Security Council is contemptuous of arms control as &quot;baggage from the cold war.&quot; In short, as dangers posed by nuclear weapons have grown and a new arms race unfolds, efforts to curtail or even discuss them have ended. Finally, anti-cold war forces that once played an important role in the United States no longer exist. Cold war lobbies, old and new ones, therefore operate virtually unopposed, some of them funded by anti-Kremlin Russian oligarchs in exile. At high political levels, the new American cold war has been, and remains, fully bipartisan, from Clinton to Bush, Madeleine Albright to Rice, Edwards to McCain. At lower levels, once robust pro-détente public groups, particularly anti-arms-race movements, have been largely demobilized by official, media and academic myths that &quot;the cold war is over&quot; and we have been &quot;liberated&quot; from nuclear and other dangers in Russia. Also absent (or silent) are the kinds of American scholars who protested cold war excesses in the past. Meanwhile, a legion of new intellectual cold warriors has emerged, particularly in Washington, media favorites whose crusading anti-Putin zeal goes largely unchallenged. (Typically, one inveterate missionary constantly charges Moscow with &quot;not delivering&quot; on US interests, while another now calls for a surreal crusade, &quot;backed by international donors,&quot; to correct young Russians' thinking about Stalin.) There are a few notable exceptions--also bipartisan, from former Reaganites to Nation contributors--but &quot;anathematizing Russia,&quot; as Gorbachev recently put it, is so consensual that even an outspoken critic of US policy inexplicably ends an article, &quot;Of course, Russia has been largely to blame.&quot; Making these political factors worse has been the &quot;pluralist&quot; US mainstream media. In the past, opinion page editors and television producers regularly solicited voices to challenge cold war zealots, but today such dissenters, and thus the vigorous public debate of the past, are almost entirely missing. Instead, influential editorial pages are dominated by resurgent cold war orthodoxies, led by the Post, whose incessant demonization of Putin's &quot;autocracy&quot; and &quot;crude neoimperialism&quot; reads like a bygone Pravda on the Potomac. On the conservative New York Sun's front page, US-Russian relations today are presented as &quot;a duel to the death--perhaps literally.&quot; The Kremlin's strong preference &quot;not to return to the cold war era,&quot; as Putin stated May 13 in response to Cheney's inflammatory charges, has been mainly responsible for preventing such fantasies from becoming reality. &quot;Someone is still fighting the cold war,&quot; a British academic recently wrote, &quot;but it isn't Russia.&quot; A fateful struggle over this issue, however, is now under way in Moscow, with the &quot;pro-Western&quot; Putin resisting demands for a &quot;more hard line&quot; course and, closely related, favoring larger FDR-style investments in the people (and the country's stability). </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Unless US policy</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, which is abetting the hard-liners in that struggle, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">changes</span></u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">fundamentally, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the</span> symbiotic axis between American and Russian <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">cold war</span>riors that drove the last conflict <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">will re-emerge</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

None of those programs are possible without abandoning the warped priorities and fallacies that have shaped US policy since 1991. National security requires identifying and pursuing essential priorities, but US policy-makers have done neither consistently. The only truly vital American interest in Russia today is preventing its stockpiles of mass destruction from endangering the world, whether through Russia's destabilization or hostility to the West. All of the dangerous fallacies underlying US policy are expressions of unbridled triumphalism. The decision to treat post-Soviet Russia as a vanquished nation, analogous to postwar Germany and Japan (but without the funding), squandered a historic opportunity for a real partnership and established the bipartisan premise that Moscow's &quot;direction&quot; at home and abroad should be determined by the United States. Applied to a country with Russia's size and long history as a world power, and that had not been militarily defeated, the premise was inherently self-defeating and certain to provoke a resentful backlash. That folly produced two others. One was the assumption that the United States had the right, wisdom and power to remake post-Communist Russia into a political and economic replica of America. A conceit as vast as its ignorance of Russia's historical traditions and contemporary realities, it led to the counterproductive crusade of the 1990s, which continues in various ways today. The other was the presumption that Russia should be America's junior partner in foreign policy with no interests except those of the United States. By disregarding Russia's history, different geopolitical realities and vital interests, this presumption has also been senseless. As a Eurasian state with 20-25 million Muslim citizens of its own and with Iran one of its few neighbors not being recruited by NATO, for example, Russia can ill afford to be drawn into Washington's expanding conflict with the Islamic world, whether in Iran or Iraq. Similarly, by demanding that Moscow vacate its traditional political and military positions in former Soviet republics so the United States and NATO can occupy them--and even subsidize Ukraine's defection with cheap gas--Washington is saying that Russia not only has no Monroe Doctrine-like rights in its own neighborhood but no legitimate security rights at all. Not surprisingly, such flagrant double standards have convinced the Kremlin that Washington has become more belligerent since Yeltsin's departure simply &quot;because Russian policy has become more pro-Russian.&quot; Nor was American triumphalism a fleeting reaction to 1991. A decade later, the tragedy of September 11 gave Washington a second chance for a real partnership with Russia. At a meeting on June 16, 2001, President Bush sensed in Putin's &quot;soul&quot; a partner for America. And so it seemed after September 11, when Putin's Kremlin did more than any NATO government to assist the US war effort in Afghanistan, giving it valuable intelligence, a Moscow-trained Afghan combat force and easy access to crucial air bases in former Soviet Central Asia. The Kremlin understandably believed that in return Washington would give it an equitable relationship. Instead, it got US withdrawal from the ABM treaty, Washington's claim to permanent bases in Central Asia (as well as Georgia) and independent access to Caspian oil and gas, a second round of NATO expansion taking in several former Soviet republics and bloc members, and a still-growing indictment of its domestic and foreign conduct. Astonishingly, not even September 11 was enough to end Washington's winner-take-all principles. Why have Democratic and Republican administrations believed they could act in such relentlessly anti-Russian ways without endangering US national security? The answer is another fallacy--the belief that Russia, diminished and weakened by its loss of the Soviet Union, had no choice but to bend to America's will. Even apart from the continued presence of Soviet-era weapons in Russia, it was a grave misconception. Because of its extraordinary material and human attributes, Russia, as its intellectuals say, has always been &quot;destined to be a great power.&quot; This was still true after 1991. Even before world energy prices refilled its coffers, the </span><u>Kremlin had ready alternatives to the humiliating role scripted by Washington. Above all, Russia could forge strategic alliances with eager anti-US and non-NATO governments in the East and elsewhere, becoming an arsenal of conventional weapons and nuclear knowledge for states from China and India to Iran and Venezuela</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Moscow has already begun that turning away from the West, and it could move much further in that direction.</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Still more, even today's diminished Russia can fight, perhaps win, a cold war on its new front lines across the vast former Soviet territories. It has the advantages of geographic proximity, essential markets, energy pipelines and corporate ownership, along with kinship and language and common experiences. They give Moscow an array of soft and hard power to use, if it chooses, against neighboring governments considering a new patron in faraway Washington. Economically, the Kremlin could cripple nearly destitute Georgia and Moldova by banning their products and otherwise unemployed migrant workers from Russia and by charging Georgia and Ukraine full &quot;free-market&quot; prices for essential energy. Politically, Moscow could truncate tiny Georgia and Moldova, and big Ukraine, by welcoming their large, pro-Russian territories into the Russian Federation or supporting their demands for independent statehood (as the West has been doing for Kosovo and Montenegro in Serbia). Militarily, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Moscow could take further steps toward turning the S</span>hanghai <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">C</span>ooperation <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">O</span>rganization--now composed of Russia, China and four Central Asian states, with Iran and India possible members--<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">into</span> an anti-NATO defensive alliance, an &quot;<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">OPEC with nuclear weapons</span>,&quot; a Western analyst warned.</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;"> That is not all. In the US-Russian struggle in Central Asia over Caspian oil and gas, Washington, as even the triumphalist Thomas Friedman admits, &quot;is at a severe disadvantage.&quot; The United States has already lost its military base in Uzbekistan and may soon lose the only remaining one in the region, in Kyrgyzstan; the new pipeline it backed to bypass Russia runs through Georgia, whose stability depends considerably on Moscow; Washington's new friend in oil-rich Azerbaijan is an anachronistic dynastic ruler; and Kazakhstan, whose enormous energy reserves make it a particular US target, has its own large Russian population and is moving back toward Moscow. Nor is the Kremlin powerless in direct dealings with the West. It can mount more than enough warheads to defeat any missile shield and illusion of &quot;nuclear primacy.&quot; It can shut US businesses out of multibillion-dollar deals in Russia and, as it recently reminded the European Union, which gets 25 percent of its gas from Russia, &quot;redirect supplies&quot; to hungry markets in the East. And Moscow could deploy its resources, connections and UN Security Council veto against US interests involving, for instance, nuclear proliferation, Iran, Afghanistan and possibly even Iraq. </span><u>Contrary to exaggerated US accusations, the Kremlin has not yet resorted to such retaliatory measures in any significant way. But</u> <u>unless Washington <strong>stops abasing and encroaching on Russia</strong>, there is no</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> &quot;sovereign&quot; reason </span><u>why it should not do so</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Certainly, nothing Moscow has gotten from Washington since 1992, a Western security specialist emphasizes, &quot;compensates for the geopolitical harm the United States is doing to Russia.&quot; American crusaders insist it is worth the risk in order to democratize Russia and other former Soviet republics. In reality, their campaigns since 1992 have only discredited that cause in Russia. Praising the despised Yeltsin and endorsing other unpopular figures as Russia's &quot;democrats,&quot; while denouncing the popular Putin, has associated democracy with the social pain, chaos and humiliation of the 1990s. Ostracizing Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko while embracing tyrants in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan has related it to the thirst for oil. Linking &quot;democratic revolutions&quot; in Ukraine and Georgia to NATO membership has equated them with US expansionism. Focusing on the victimization of billionaire Mikhail Khodorkhovsky and not on Russian poverty or ongoing mass protests against social injustices has suggested democracy is only for oligarchs. And by insisting on their indispensable role, US crusaders have all but said (wrongly) that Russians are incapable of democracy or resisting abuses of power on their own. The result is dark Russian suspicions of American intentions ignored by US policy-makers and media alike. They include the belief that Washington's real purpose is to take control of the country's energy resources and nuclear weapons and use encircling NATO satellite states to &quot;de-sovereignize&quot; Russia, turning it into a &quot;vassal of the West.&quot; More generally, US policy has fostered the belief that the American cold war was never really aimed at Soviet Communism but always at Russia, a suspicion given credence by Post and Times columnists who characterize Russia even after Communism as an inherently &quot;autocratic state&quot; with &quot;brutish instincts.&quot; </span><u>To overcome those towering obstacles to a new relationship, Washington has to abandon the triumphalist conceits primarily responsible for the revived cold war and its growing dangers. It means respecting Russia's sovereign right to determine its course at home</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (including disposal of its energy resources). As the record plainly shows, interfering in Moscow's internal affairs, whether on-site or from afar, only harms the chances for political liberties and economic prosperity that still exist in that tormented nation. </span><u>It also means acknowledging Russia's legitimate security interests, especially in its own &quot;near abroad.&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In particular, the planned third expansion of NATO, intended to include Ukraine, must not take place. Extending NATO to Russia's doorsteps has already brought relations near the breaking point (without actually benefiting any nation's security); absorbing Ukraine, which Moscow regards as essential to its Slavic identity and its military defense, may be the point of no return, as even pro-US Russians anxiously warn. Nor would it be democratic, since nearly two-thirds of Ukrainians are opposed. The explosive possibilities were adumbrated in late May and early June when local citizens in ethnic Russian Crimea blockaded a port and roads where a US naval ship and contingent of Marines suddenly appeared, provoking resolutions declaring the region &quot;anti-NATO territory&quot; and threats of &quot;a new Vietnam.&quot; </span><br />

<strong>Militarizing the SCO causes World War III</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Stakelbeck, 5</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – freelance writer and East Asia expert (Frederick, “Is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization a Military Confederacy?,” September 26, Global Politician, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalpolitician.com/21244-russia-china" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalpolitician.com/21244-russia-china</a>) </span><br />
<br />
<u>The most troubling development</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the past month </span><u>related to the SCO is the growing prospect of a nuclear-obsessed Iran joining the organization as a permanent member</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the newly elected conservative President of Iran, is a proven U.S. antagonist and a firm believer in spreading revolutionary Islamist ideology throughout the Muslim world. His recent comments at the U.N. concerning the U.S. show a preparation for confrontation with the U.S. Making matters worse; Iran is planning to build up its military forces. Iran had planned to double its military budget by 2010, but thanks to record oil revenues, that timetable has been adjusted to 2008. New Thinking Needed </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The </span>SCO is a menacing confederacy of powerful nations arising out of the shadows of the Cold War that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">could cause</span> tremendous <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">global instability and</span> even lead to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">world war</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Geopolitics aside, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the SCO has the potential to become the most powerful alliance on earth, combining Russia</span>’s energy, military and technology expertise; <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">China and India</span>’s economic and human capital; <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and Iran</span>’s enormous energy resources and growing military capabilities. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This</span> unique combination <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">makes the SCO a formidable adversary</span> for the U.S</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In February, Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) chief of staff General Liang Guanglie said the Peace Mission 2005 exercises would, “protect the peace and stability in our region and the world.” The world? The world has been led to believe that the SCO is a regional alliance designed to address issues of mutual concern such as terrorism, separatism and extremism -- whatever they may mean at the moment for the members of the SCO. With military operations scheduled for 2006 and an expanded list of participating nations, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the military threat</span> posed by the SCO <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is starting to take shape</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. At this time, what steps need to be taken by the U.S. to prepare for a possible SCO military threat? First, the U.S. Congress, Department of Defense and U.S. intelligence community must recognize that the continued </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">military modernization and integration</span> involving Russia, China, India, Pakistan and Iran <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">will directly threaten the U.S.</span> and its allies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> within the next several years. This is an uncomfortable reality, but one which is taking shape right before our eyes. Second, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">calls</span> by the SCO and others in the international community <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">for</span> an immediate <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">withdraw of U.S. troops</span> from the Middle East and Central Asia <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">should be disregarded, due to the horrific consequences that the inevitable power vacuum would cause</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Instead, strategic alliances should be strengthened with countries such as Georgia and the Ukraine to counter any regional threat. Third, recent calls by Iran for a Muslim seat on the UN Security Council should be viewed for what they are; an effort by Tehran to weaken U.S. legitimacy in the international community and diminish its influence in Central Asia and the Middle East. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s announcement that his country will sell “peaceful” nuclear technology to other Islamic countries is too chilling to contemplate. In short, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the SCO is</span> an <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">immature, but potentially dangerous</span> confederacy of countries with a mutual interest to dethrone the U.S. and if necessary, confront it militarily. Under the guise of economic partnership, regional alliances and friendship, China, Russia and the other members of the SCO are rapidly increasing their collective power</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Recent Pentagon reports identifying China as a growing threat are indeed accurate, but don’t go far enough.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Worrying as the events of last year have been, one </span><u>notable</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> benefit </span><u>has been the beginning of what appears to be a new spirit of resolve and cooperation between the United States and its core Asian allies.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Washington has long enjoyed close and effective relations with Seoul and Tokyo.

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon. I am delighted to have both Minister Maehara of Japan and Minister Kim of the Republic of Korea here for these consultations and </span><u>this historic <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">trilateral</span> meeting</u> <u>that underscores the strength of our shared commitment to advancing regional peace, prosperity, and stability<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. </span>These <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">discussions illustrate the importance of the deep bilateral relationships that the United States has with Japan and South Korea</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as well as the value of the partnership between Japan and South Korea. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Such strong relationships are the foundation for the unified position </span>that our countries are taking <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">with respect to North Korea</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">We all agree that </span><u>North Korea’s provocative and belligerent behavior jeopardizes peace and stability in Asia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We are deeply concerned by its unprovoked attack on the island of Yeonpyeong, resulting in the loss of South Korean lives. On behalf of the American people, I would like to convey our sympathies to the victims and their families. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. </span><u>We want the people of South Korea to know</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that we are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with you, and </span><u>we are deeply committed to your defense</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The minister and I share the view that the attack by the North Koreans violates the Armistice Agreement of 1953; that North Korea’s provocative and belligerent behavior threatens us all, and that it will be met with solidarity from all three countries. The attack is the latest in a series of North Korean provocations. It has disclosed a uranium enrichment program that violates UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, as well as North Korea’s commitments under the September 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks. And the sinking of the Cheonan, killing 46 South Korean sailors, deepened North Korea’s international isolation. From day one of the Obama Administration, we have made clear that North Korea needs to change. The international community has repeatedly presented North Korean leadership with a path toward greater engagement and integration, but thus far they have chosen the path of confrontation and isolation. The path to a better relationship and a secure and prosperous future is still open to North Korea if it makes the right choices. We remain committed to seeking opportunities for dialogue. But we will not reward North Korea for shattering the peace or defying the international community. This trilateral meeting reaffirmed the steps that North Korea must take in order for a resumption of Six-Party Talks to produce results. North Korea must improve relations with the Republic of Korea and cease its provocative behavior. North Korea must also comply with its international obligations and take concrete steps to implement its denuclearization commitments under the September 2005 Joint Statement. As part of our comprehensive strategy going forward, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen will lead a delegation to South Korea tonight to enhance coordination on strategic deterrence. He will then visit Tokyo. Next week, I will be sending a high-level team to Asia to follow up on today’s meeting. The ministers and I are also in close consultation with China and Russia. I have emphasized to my Chinese colleagues that China, as a vital partner in maintaining regional stability, a country with unique and strong ties with North Korea, and chair of the Six-Party Talks, has a special role to play in helping to shape North Korea’s behavior. We will continue to work closely with Beijing, Moscow, and the rest of the international community to fully implement UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874. Last night, President Obama spoke with Chinese President Hu. They reaffirmed the importance of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. And we appreciate Beijing’s initiative to propose an emergency Six-Party gathering. However, we first need an appropriate basis for the resumption of talks. Any effort, of course, must start with North Korea ceasing all provocative and belligerent behavior. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The U.S. treaty alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea have been the foundation for peace and stability in Asia for decades, and the Japan-South Korea partnership helps form a triangle of stability and cooperation</span>. The ministers and I reaffirmed our steadfast commitments under our respective defense treaties.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In addition, on Friday, the Republic of Korea and the United States, completed negotiations on a landmark Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement that will further strengthen the bonds between our two countries. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">These strong bilateral relationships are now enhancing our trilateral cooperation, as well as all of our countries’ relationships with China.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The United States is encouraged by steps that China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea have taken to deepen their bilateral ties, because we believe that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">strong relationships among all four countries are an essential element of peace and stability in Asia.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The ministers and I also <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">released </span></span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a joint trilateral statement</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">provides a framework to enhance regional cooperation and collaboration.
