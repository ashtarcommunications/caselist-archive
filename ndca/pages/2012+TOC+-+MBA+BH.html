 Obama on track to win 2012 by sticking solely to the message of job creation and economic recovery.<br />

Obama as the embattled incumbent can defy the odds of history that suggest high unemployment and low job approval predict defeat, his advisers believe. How? Team Obama said the president can pull it off by selling a compelling vision for the future; touting past policy achievements and experience to key constituencies (Axelrod mentioned the health reform law as a net plus among Hispanic voters); using the bully pulpit to engrave the president’s jobs and the economic message with the public; and sparring with an unpopular Congress (and during the primaries with the GOP challengers) to draw sharp contrasts and show some fight. The president, they said, will stick with themes of protecting middle-class values, as outlined during his speech last week in Kansas. “This is what we’re going to be hammering throughout this campaign,” Axelrod added. “It’s a very distinct vision from what the Republicans offered.” Despite recent polls that indicate the president is trailing in some swing states, Axelrod continued, “all the data and all the research I see suggests there’s a solid core for the president, and there is a significant group of voters who are up for grabs -- and those voters don’t have a very positive view of the Republican Party.”<br />

Public opposes increases in space programs – perceives that the plan costs exorbitant amounts of money.<br />

Public support for overall space funding has hovered around 80 percent in favor of the status quo since 1965, except for a major dip in support during the early 1970s. That may bode well for NASA's continued existence, but it also suggests that few people are clamoring to throw even more money at the space agency. Budget myths Still, polls also show a huge misconception regarding the cost of the U.S. space program. Public opinion has wrongly put NASA's budget at about 22 percent of the government's spending over the years, when in fact NASA's budget only reached 4.3 percent of the federal budget at its peak in 1965. Since the 1970s, the U.S. space agency's budget has hovered below 1 percent of government spending. &quot;My suggestion is that NASA is so visible and the space shuttle is such a powerful icon that people believe this stuff must cost an enormous amount of money,&quot; Launius said. As for 2010, NASA's budget came in at just six-tenths of 1 percent of all government spending. Neither side of the political aisle seems to have any real interest in boosting NASA's budget, according to Launius. NASA also seems unlikely to get a dramatic budget boost in the near future. While an October 2010 NASA authorization bill signed by the president called for a slight increase in the space agency's funding, that money has yet to be appropriated. Instead, NASA and all other non-military government agencies have been frozen at their 2010 funding levels by a Congressional continuing resolution (a stopgap until a full budget can be agreed upon) that holds until March 4. Finding a prime directive U.S. space agency funding in recent years has depended upon certain congressional interests in protecting NASA-related jobs, as well as a fuzzier &quot;feel-good&quot; sentiment toward keeping the space agency afloat. If NASA ever wants to get a bigger budget to send astronauts back to the moon or beyond, it will need to find compelling reasons – whether they're related to the search for life or a precious &quot;unobtanium&quot; resource worth going after and exploiting, some experts say. Launius also suggested that the lack of political support for returning astronauts to the moon is related to the bigger question hanging over the purpose of human spaceflight – or rather, the lack of clearly defined purpose. &quot;There's an inability of the aerospace community – and I include myself here – to articulate a clear, irrevocable, unassailable rationale for doing this,&quot; Launius said.<br />

<br />
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama cannot escape one giant vulnerability as he bids to keep his job: There are millions of voters who still don't have [jobs] one. Suddenly, the snapshot of the American economy is depressing again. Job creation is down. So is consumer confidence. And homes sales, auto sales, construction spending, manufacturing expansion. The brutal month of May was a reminder of the economy's fragility and the risks for an incumbent president. Nothing that Obama oversees, not even a success as dramatic as finding and killing Osama bin Laden, will matter as much as his handling of the economy. It is the dominant driver of voter behavior. People hold their president accountable if they can't find work in the richest country in the world. The weakening recovery is testing the entire foundation of Obama's optimistic economic message, that the nation is getting stronger all the time. As much as the White House says it never dwells on any single jobs report, and Obama never even mentioned the troubling one released Friday, the stakes get higher by the month. A finally forming field of Republican presidential competitors is maneuvering into the space for the public's attention with this message: Obama has failed. Election Day 2012 is 17 months away, and Obama's campaign knows incremental job growth won't do. The unemployment rate is 9.1 percent. If it stays anywhere near there, Obama will face re-election with a higher jobless rate than any other post-war president. In his favor, Obama still has the loudest voice to sell his message that the longer term trends, including job growth every month, are good. Nearly halfway through a year dominated by foreign events mostly outside his control, he plans to build his next few months around economic events. So what comes next will be a summer when both sides select the economic facts that best suit their case. It will play against a backdrop of trying to cut a massive deficit while letting the nation borrow more so it doesn't default. As Obama pushes his economic agenda, his re-election chances bank on more than job growth. They also depend on how well he can remind people that he inherited a recession and that compared with the early days of 2009, the country is in a better place. &quot;This economy took a big hit,&quot; Obama said Friday in Ohio, a pivotal 2012 state. &quot;You know, it's just like if you had a bad illness, if you got hit by a truck, it's going to take a while for you to mend. And that's what's happened to our economy. It's taking a while to mend.&quot;<br />

The Obama administration is reportedly considering major reductions in the size the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The administration has reportedly asked the Pentagon to evaluate three options for further cuts: to approximately 1100, 800, or 400 weapons. Any of these scenarios would take the United States well below the ceiling imposed by the New START treaty, which requires the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals to no more than 1,550 deployed weapons. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the strategic value of the U.S. nuclear stockpile has declined significantly in the 21st century. Nuclear weapons have been useless in all of the U.S.’s recent military campaigns — Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. And they offer no protection against terrorist groups and subnational actors, two of the most significant threats facing the United States today. In fact, the Pentagon’s own strategic thinkers have noted that the strategic landscape has changed and that the U.S.’s Cold War-sized arsenal may exceed the country’s current needs. The Defense Department’s strategic guidance document, released in early January, states that “it is possible that our deterrence goals can be achieved with a smaller nuclear force, which would reduce the number of nuclear weapons in our inventory as well as their role in U.S. national security strategy.” Moreover, according to strategists at the Air War College and the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies, the U.S. could draw down its arsenal to 311 survivable reliable weapons and still maintain a credible deterrent. For two reasons, President Obama is wise to reevaluate the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. First, our massive nuclear arsenal is tremendously expensive and diverts funds away from programs designed to bolster the U.S.’s long-term health of the U.S. economy and military. The budget for “nuclear weapons activities” is projected to grow by 6 percent to $18 billion next year in FY 2013. It will be 20 percent higher in real terms than President Reagan’s largest nuclear weapons budget. Further, unless the Pentagon reduces the number of deployed nuclear weapons significantly, it will have to modernize all three legs of the triad at a cost of over $100 billion. Protecting and modernizing our exponentially larger nuclear stockpile adds to the national debt and sucks up taxpayer dollars that could be used to bolster our economy, put people back to work, or invest in technologies that support our men and women serving around the globe. Adopting the Air War College recommendation would save the Pentagon at least $11 billion per year. Second, significant reductions in the U.S. nuclear arsenal would give the Obama administration the moral authority to push for stronger international commitments control the spread weapons-usable nuclear technology and material. President Obama has called nuclear terrorism the “single biggest threat to U.S. security, both short-term, medium-term and long-term.” Demonstrating that the United States is serious about controlling the size of its own nuclear stockpile would breathe life into the global nonproliferation regime, thereby decrease the chances of a terrorist group acquiring a nuclear warhead without undermining U.S. security. Given the fiscal problems facing our nation and historic highs in defense spending, the Obama administration has been right to downsize or eliminate out-dated weapons systems that do little to further American security, like the F-22 and EFV. Surplus nuclear weapons, which are expensive to maintain and protect, should be no exception. Last week, State department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland criticized the Iranian government, stating it “would rather spend money on a nuclear weapons program than on the welfare of its people.” Reducing the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal to more strategically reasonable levels will allow the Obama administration to practice what it preaches.<br />

A nuclear attack by terrorists will be much more critical than Hiroshima and Nagazaki, even if -- and this is far from certain -- the weapons used are less harmful than those used then, Japan, at the time, with no knowledge of nuclear technology, had no choice but to capitulate. Today, the technology is a secret for nobody. So far, except for the two bombs dropped on Japan, nuclear weapons have been used only to threaten. Now we are at a stage where they can be detonated. This completely changes the rules of the game. We have reached a point where anticipatory measures can determine the course of events. Allegations of a terrorist connection can be used to justify anticipatory measures, including the invasion of a sovereign state like Iraq. As it turned out, these allegations, as well as the allegation that Saddam was harbouring WMD, proved to be unfounded. What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? Even if it fails, it would further exacerbate the negative features of the new and frightening world in which we are now living. Societies would close in on themselves, police measures would be stepped up at the expense of human rights, tensions between civilisations and religions would rise and ethnic conflicts would proliferate. It would also speed up the arms race and develop the awareness that a different type of world order is imperative if humankind is to survive. But the still more critical scenario is if the attack succeeds. This could lead to a third world war, from which no one will emerge victorious. Unlike a conventional war which ends when one side triumphs over another, this war will be without winners and losers. When nuclear pollution infects the whole planet, we will all be losers.<br />

<br />
BEIJING — China’s top leaders are retaking the initiative after the country’s worst political crisis in a generation, showcasing a united front and moving forward with plans for a major leadership reshuffle later this year. But the ouster of Bo Xilai, the populist icon formerly in charge of the southwestern megacity of Chongqing, has spurred weeks of frenzied internal politicking and a rare dissenting vote within the Politburo Standing Committee, according to interviews with publishers, academics and analysts tied to the Communist Party’s upper echelons or its powerful families. They say that the outward calm is tenuous and was achieved only after China’s leadership team of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao appealed to party elders for support and yielded important posts in Chongqing to representatives of other influential political blocs. “They want everyone to believe that the top level has no problem — that there’s no split and no struggle,” said Jin Zhong, publisher of the influential China-watching magazine Open, in Hong Kong. “But this is a false impression.” According to people briefed by central party officials, Mr. Bo is being confined to his house in Beijing, watched by the Central Guard Bureau, a unit of the People’s Liberation Army under the control of the party’s General Office. He faces a disciplinary investigation over a range of allegations of corruption and abuse of power, these people say. His wife, a noted lawyer, is under more formal detention in connection with some of those allegations. Much is at stake because the party is undergoing its once-in-a-decade leadership reshuffle. Over the next year, the Communist Party will get a new leadership team and general secretary, who will pick a new premier and other top government positions. Until his fall, Mr. Bo was a contender for one of the leadership slots. But in early February, Mr. Bo’s police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to the United States Consulate in Chengdu with damning evidence about his boss. That precipitated a divisive meeting on March 7 of the party’s Standing Committee, the nine-person body that effectively rules China, according to two people close to ruling circles. Eight of the nine top leaders, including the current party boss, Hu Jintao; the country’s premier, Wen Jiabao; the incoming party boss, Xi Jinping; and the incoming premier, Li Keqiang, are said to have supported or gone along with the decision to remove and investigate Mr. Bo. But, crucially, the head of the country’s ubiquitous security services, Zhou Yongkang, resisted, these people said. Mr. Bo was seen as Mr. Zhou’s possible successor and Mr. Zhou had previously endorsed Mr. Bo’s zealous crackdown on organized crime. The position of Mr. Bo’s onetime patron, the former leader Jiang Zemin, was unclear, although he appears not to have intervened in the decision. Mr. Bo failed to attend a Parliament meeting the next day, but at a news conference on March 9, he denied any wrongdoing and predicted that Mr. Hu would eventually visit Chongqing. But on March 15, official media issued a terse statement saying Mr. Bo had been removed from his main post. That was not the end of the effort to forge broader consensus, party insiders say. Instead, top leaders like Mr. Hu and Mr. Wen have met with ministers, provincial leaders and party elders to marshal approval for Mr. Bo’s ouster and solicit views on handling the case. Some of those approached include the former premiers Zhu Rongji and Li Peng, as well as the former top leaders Li Ruihuan and Qiao Shi, people familiar with the matter say. Party officials have also floated trial-balloon versions of the investigation. At closed-door briefings, selected top officials have been read documents from central offices enumerating a range of initial charges against Mr. Bo, they said. Mr. Wang has been branded a “traitor.” Reflecting the uncertainty at the top, some analysts say, online censors have allowed some damaging rumors and details about Mr. Bo and Mr. Zhou to circulate widely, but also tolerated some support for Mr. Bo. But outwardly, top leaders are pushing unity. After failing to appear in person at a national legal conference last week, Mr. Zhou has now been in the Chinese press regularly urging legal and police officials to toe the party line. Mr. Hu has embarked on a trip abroad. On Tuesday, the main army newspaper ordered military officers to ignore “social noise” and “hostile forces,” and to unite under the party. The party congress is also thought to be going ahead largely as planned. Key decisions will not be made until the summer, but a line-up for the nine-person Standing Committee is slowly jelling, with Mr. Bo given almost no chance of assuming a position on it. Instead, he appears to be fighting to retain some kind of ceremonial post and to avoid prison.<br />

Lack of US diplomatic engagement is a prerequisite for Chinese engagement- key to political legitimacy<br />

<br />
China has new goals as it has become more engaged in the world. First, it desperately needs access to resources. It has a high level of industrial development, but is a vast consumer of resources. If China was to develop at the same pace as the US and consume the same amount of resources, it would be on a scale unprecedented in the world. As a result, the Chinese government worries desperately where it is going to get oil and gas. The government doesn't have the kind of legitimacy that comes from elections; its legitimacy comes from delivering economic growth. Every time that growth declines or if there's an electricity blackout or the like, the government worries. The Chinese also have been overly dependent on too few oil and gas suppliers in the world. They now look to places they can get oil and gas where they won't be in direct competition with the US or Japan, places like Sudan and other countries where Western nations either can't go because of sanctions or fear to go because the environment is dangerous. Also, as Chinese companies start to become internationally active, they want to have places they can sell their goods. Again, they often want to go to places where there's less immediate competition with the US - places where the environment is difficult for business. As they get more influential, the Chinese want more partners in international organizations such as the UN, the WTO, etc. Isolating Taiwan has been a Chinese goal since the US and the rest of the world recognized China, and in the past few years, as China has become more proactive and internationally engaged, they have sought more to isolate Taiwan, which has informal links with many other parts of the world. China's strategy since the late 1990s shows recognition that in the US its image will likely be mixed. Therefore, if it could change its perception in other parts of the world and reduce fears of its economic and military power in other parts of the world, it could play a much greater role on the global stage. This is actually quite sophisticated thinking.<br />

Mr. Bo’s continuing influence helps explain why the party has not issued a fuller explanation. He is still, formally, a member of the 25-member Politburo, and commands support among some generals, descendants of revolutionaries and others in the Communist Party’s left wing who are uneasy about the loss of traditional Communist ideology. Ultimately, even if Mr. Bo is found to have had corrupt dealings, those who have supported him within the party hierarchy are likely to insist on concessions for his removal from power. Already, horse-trading appears to have begun. Mr. Bo’s temporary replacement in Chongqing, Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang, is like Mr. Bo a protégé of Mr. Jiang and a contender for promotion to the Standing Committee. A veteran of Mr. Hu’s political power base was positioned to replace Mr. Wang atop Chongqing’s police force, only to be transferred in recent days in favor of another man closer to Mr. Zhou’s camp.<br />

Failure of reform causes multiple nuclear wars<br />

<br />
The fourth factor contributing to the perception of a China threat is the fear of political and economic collapse in the PRC, resulting in territorial fragmentation, civil war and waves of refugees pouring into neighboring countries. Naturally, any or all of the scenarios would have a profoundly negative impact on regional stability. Today the Chinese leadership faces a raft of internal problems, including the increasing political demands of its citizens, a growing population, a shortage of natural resources and a deterioration in the natural environment caused by rapid industrialization and pollution. These problems are putting a strain on the central government’s ability to govern effectively. Political disintegration or a Chinese civil war might result in millions of Chinese refugees seeking asylum in neighboring countries. Such an unprecedented exodus of refugees from a collapsed PRC would no doubt put a severe strain on the limited resources of China’s neighbors. A fragmented China could also result in another nightmare scenario- nuclear weapons falling into the hands of irresponsible local provincial leaders or warlords. From this perspective, a disintegrating China would also pose a threat to its neighbors and the world.<br />

<br />
Although some believe that any arms race resulting from missile defense conflicts would be stabilizing or purely defensive in nature, such issues detract from the larger question at stake: why do these two countries still conduct and plan their nuclear policy as if they are still intense adversaries? While relations are clearly better than they were at the height of the Cold War, conflicts over missile defense continue to abound, hampering bilateral cooperation on a host of other important issues. According to Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Endowment, missile defense could be “the ‘silver bullet’ to replace the remaining aftershocks of the Cold War with a non-adversarial strategic relationship”, but only if it is a cooperative, joint system rather than one which exacerbates Russian threat perceptions of U.S. nuclear first strike capabilities. Many other experts, such as Vladmir Dvorkin of the Carnegie Moscow Center, argue that eliminating the damage limitation mission against Russia’s nuclear forces, and thus “the impact of continuing mutual nuclear deterrence” on the overall bilateral relationship, could be a useful step in building the trust necessary for “genuine cooperation” over future joint missile defense systems, enhancing the capability’s effectiveness at “intercepting all types of ballistic missiles” and reducing tensions in other political arenas.<br />

As we can see, the Russian early-warning network is indeed in a serious decline and cannot provide the Russian strategic forces with the support necessary to exercise the launch-on-warning option. In fact, there is virtually no chance that the system will ever recover to be of any use for launch-on-warning. What is important to note that the system has been constantly losing its capabilities for quite some time now and the Russian military are very well aware of this fact. Given that the Soviet and Russian military have never relied on the early warning system to begin with, it should not have been difficult for them to adjust operations of the strategic forces to completely exclude the deteriorating system from the decision-making process. Further degradation of the early-warning system will only diminish its role and is very unlikely to increase the danger of inadvertent launch.<br />

Alerts wont cause accidental launch<br />

Most of the experts define de-alerting as implementing some reversible physical changes in a weapon system that would significantly increase time between the decision to use the weapon and the actual moment of its launch. The proponents of this concept consider it as one of the ways to maintain strategic stability. They provide the following arguments in support of this concept. Radical changes have occurred in US-Russian relations. Russia and the United States are building strategic partnership relationship. In such situation the high alert readiness of strategic offensive forces targeted at each other does not correspond to the character of our relations. Strategic nuclear forces high alert readiness in combination with a concept of launch-on-warning strike increases the risk of “accidental” nuclear war (as a result of mistakes in the C3I system, inadequate situation analysis, mistaken decision-making, unauthorized action of personnel or even terrorists, provocation from the “third” states or non-state actors, etc.); False signals about missile attacks obtained from early warning system that may trigger an accidental launch. This assumption was very popular when the Russian early warning system was weakened as a result of collapse of the Soviet Union. Analysis of the above arguments shows, that they do not have solid grounds. Today Russian and U.S. ICBMs are not targeted at any state. High alert status of the Russian and U.S. strategic nuclear forces has not been an obstacle for building a strategic partnership. The issue of the possibility of an “accidental” nuclear war itself is hypothetical. Both states have developed and implemented constructive organizational and technical measures that practically exclude launches resulting from unauthorized action of personnel or terrorists. Nuclear weapons are maintained under very strict system of control that excludes any accidental or unauthorized use and guarantees that these weapons can only be used provided that there is an appropriate authorization by the national leadership. Besides that it should be mentioned that even the Soviet Union and the United States had taken important bilateral steps toward decreasing the risk of accidental nuclear conflict. Direct emergency telephone “red line” has been established between the White House and the Kremlin in 1963. In 1971 the USSR and USA signed the Agreement on Measures to Reduce the Nuclear War Threat. This Agreement established the actions of each side in case of even a hypothetical accidental missile launch and it contains the requirements for the owner of the launched missile to deactivate and eliminate the missile. Both the Soviet Union and the United States have developed proper measures to observe the agreed requirements.<br />

The United States and Russia have also worked for years to improve communications, reduce misunderstandings, and develop ways to lessen the risk of inadvertent launch or other errors in their strategic relationship. Most readers will be familiar with the Direct Communications Link (the famous “hotline”) established in 1963.27 In 1971, however, Washington and Moscow also signed an agreement establishing basic procedures to increase mutual consultation and notification regarding relatively innocent but potentially alarming activities – thereby reducing the risk of accidental nuclear war.28 Since 1987, the two parties have also operated securely- linked 24-hour communications centers – the U.S. node of which is the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center (NRRC) operated by the State Department29 – which specialize in transmitting such things as the notifications required under arms control treaties. Pursuant to a 1988 memorandum, NRRC transmittals, which go directly to the Russian Ministry of Defense, include ballistic missile launch notifications. This link also proved useful to help prevent strategic tensions after the terrorist assault of September 11, 2001 – at which point U.S. officials used the NRRC to reassure their Russian counterparts that the sudden American security alert in the wake of the Manhattan and Pentagon attacks was not in any way an indication of impending U.S. belligerence vis-à-vis Russia.<br />

Deterrence checks space weapon usage<br />

He formerly served as director of the Institute. He recently was a visiting scholar at the Virginia Military Institute in the United States. His research focuses on China-U.S. relations in the field of comparative security strategies and the application of deterrence theory. “Deterrence Revisited: Outer Space*,” pdf, KHaze<br />
<br />
It is a well-known phenomenon that the use of nuclear weapons is considered taboo. Along with the doctrine of mutual assured destruction, the use of nuclear weapons in war is almost unimaginable. The utilitization of nuclear weapons is therefore almost entirely limited to a role of deterrence. What about the taboo of space weapons? More and more specialists are looking at the impact of space debris that results from the use of space weapons.10 Large amounts of space debris caused by space weapons will invariably threaten space assets of all space-faring countries, not just intended target countries. Any attack by one country against another using space weapons will result in many losers. With so much of commercial, scientific and military activity increasingly reliant on space, there exists a considerable and growing taboo against using space weapons in a situation of conflict. Thus, under the conditions of American strategic dominance in space, reliable deterrents in space will decrease the possibility of the United States attacking Chinese space assets. At a fundamental level, space weapons – like nuclear weapons – will not alter the essential nature of war. Throughout history, there has been much ink spilled over new weapons that have the unique power and ability to change the underlying quality of war. For example, military theorists once exaggerated the tank’s role in deciding the war’s outcome during World War I.11 The atom bomb itself is probably the most salient example, as many analysts and politicians described the weapon as the unique ultimate weapon.12 But this was a fundamental misunderstanding of war and its implements. Nuclear weapons crossed a threshold in terms of their immense capacity for destruction. But deterrence, mutual assured destruction and the nuclear taboo evolved to consign the use of nuclear weapons to a near impossibility, negating its utility as a tool of war-fighting. Weapons to change the nature of war have not emerged in the past and will not emerge in the future. As such, space weapons will not be the ultimate weapon nor will they be able to decide the outcome of war, even if they are used as a first strike.<br />

US-Russian relations impossible- the US won’t genuinely engage Russia<br />

<br />
There is no question that, in today's Russia, official anti-Americanism serves a useful domestic purpose. It seeks to discredit not just a few Russian liberals but the much more numerous anti-government protesters by portraying them as America's fifth column. There is no doubt either that the view of the United States as Russia's adversary reflects the legacy of the Cold War and, perhaps even more than that, the disappointment that followed the end of the 40-year confrontation, when Russia, having withdrawn its forces from a score of countries and slashed its military equipment purchases by 68 times in just one year (1992), turned itself into an international supplicant, living from one International Monetary Fund tranche to another. But there is also the fact that, at the beginning of each post-Soviet Russian presidency, the Kremlin leader reached out to his counterpart at the White House in an effort to strike an alliance with the United States, only to be brushed off. Boris Yeltsin, in 1992, sought a formal alliance with Washington, only to be told, by George H.W. Bush, that with the Cold War over there was no need for new alliances anymore. When, however, the existing alliance, NATO, started to expand eastward, under Bill Clinton, Russia was only told not to worry. Rhetorically, the door was left open for Russia, but in reality Moscow's accession [to NATO] was never seriously considered. No wonder that Yeltsin's parting message to Clinton, in late 1999, was &quot;never to forget, not for a minute,&quot; that Russia was still a nuclear superpower. It is little mentioned these days that when Putin became president in 2000, he was determined to do what had eluded Yeltsin. Privately but very directly, he aspired to Russia's membership in NATO -- not to destroy it from the inside, as many readily suspected, but to cement the relationship with the United States, whose primacy Putin then was prepared to implicitly recognize. In the crucial first stage of the Afghanistan operation, Russia de facto became an ally of the United States. In an effort to build a strong security relationship with Washington, Putin chose not to respond to George W. Bush's unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that Moscow had always regarded as a bedrock of strategic stability, and he tolerated a U.S. military presence in the former Soviet Central Asia and Georgia. From mid-2002, however, the Bush White House became focused on Iraq, and Russia was left lying by the wayside. Putin gave vent to his pent-up frustration five years later in his famous Munich speech in which he denounced the United States, whose power refused to &quot;recognize any borders in this world.&quot; As he was picking up the pieces from the 2008 Georgia war, President Dmitry Medvedev, still overseen by Putin (now the prime minister), was positive, but initially cautious, in his response to Barack Obama's reset of the U.S. policy toward Russia. By the fall of 2009, however, he became very engaged, and by the time of the NATO-Russia summit in Lisbon a year later, Medvedev was positively enthusiastic about the U.S. relationship. The New START treaty was not enough. Medvedev started talking about missile defense cooperation in Europe as a means of placing the entire Euro-Atlantic area within a common security and defense perimeter. The Russian president's enthusiasm was short-lived. Following the failure in May 2011 to reach even a basic agreement on principles of cooperation, he issued a statement last November warning darkly about Russia's countermeasures against future U.S. missile defense deployments in Europe. True, each Russian attempt at engaging the United States has been awkward in its own way. In 1992, there was no common enemy around which to justify forming a U.S.-Russia alliance. Deng Xiaoping's China, busy with its four modernizations, did not replace the Soviet Union as a global challenger to the United States. In 2001, had Russia been admitted to NATO, the alliance would have turned into something like the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. A few years later, the United States and Russia narrowly escaped a head-on collision in the Georgia war. In 2011, a joint missile defense in Europe would have either de facto placed Russian assets under U.S./NATO authority or, more likely, made the system totally dysfunctional. But the issue here is not how the United States responded to specific Russian ideas, but rather that Washington wasn't really interested in engaging Moscow strategically at all. The reset, as the name itself suggests, is essentially a means to do away with policy glitches; it does not equal a policy, much less a long-term strategy. The U.S. rationale for having the reset in the first place had little or nothing to do with Russia. Instead, it allowed the United States to acquire Russia's logistical cooperation on the transit routes leading to Afghanistan, revive a modicum of nuclear arms control, and finalize Russia's 18-year quest to join the World Trade Organization. Beyond these relatively low-hanging fruits there was a void. Putin's formal return to the Kremlin is just days away. And with his tough campaign rhetoric and military modernization plans, on the one hand, and, on the other, the continuing protests in Russia against the existing political system, which challenge Putin's own legitimacy, the environment is even less propitious for an effort to improve strategic relations between Washington and Moscow. The more interesting issue is that, in the current U.S. foreign-policy debate, Russia has become a marginal quantity. A discussion of U.S. policy toward China can go on for hours without ever mentioning Russia; the Sturm und Drang over Iran's nuclear weapons program barely takes account of how U.S. moves might be perceived in Moscow; and though they loudly decry it with reference to Syria, hardly anyone in Washington loses sleep over the long-term implications of the ever-closer Sino-Russian alignment at the U.N. Security Council. The view of Russia as a power in permanent and unstoppable decline may be right, or it may not. If anything, Moscow should be even more interested in finding realistic ways to improve its relations with Washington. Russia's modernization agenda risks being scuttled in the event of a serious deterioration of its relations with the United States. What is striking, however, is that Washington, while focused intently on particular global issues -- from promoting the fledgling democracies of the Arab Spring to handing off Afghanistan to pivoting toward Asia -- thinks it can afford having no general strategic vision of relations with a country that, despite all its weaknesses and failings, can make a huge difference in the emerging global balance. Conventional wisdom in Washington declares that if there is no problem, there is no policy. This may have been just fine in the years of clear U.S. dominance in the world. It is hardly affordable now.<br />

In a surprising turn of events during a breakfast last Thursday, Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, told reporters that the US was not going to go along with the proposed European Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities. Citing the current draft of the Code as too restrictive, she said that it was clear from the beginning that the Obama Administration was not going along with the Code.1 This announcement is in stark contrast to the public stance taken by administration officials throughout 2011. As early as last February, the administration signaled that it was preparing to accept the EU’s draft Code with negligible changes to the instrument and that an interagency review concluded in January 2011 determined that the Code would not damage US national security interests in outer space or limit research and development of classified programs relating to outer space activities.2 Again in April, Ambassador Greg Schulte, US deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, portrayed the draft Code as a “positive approach” but emphasized that the US government had not decided whether to sign the document.<br />

<br />
The governmental nature of space law and outer space activities in general has created a paradigm where disputes that arise out of space activities are strictly the province of government agencies and diplomats. Disputes that arise in this arena are often dealt with through diplomatic channels and seldom use legal dispute resolution mechanisms to achieve a solution. However, as private commercial interests become more prevalent in outer space activities, space law, both domestic and international, has begun to merge with areas of traditional law including property, contract, and intellectual property.1 As that merger continues, international disputes between governmental entities and non-governmental commercial entities will likely grow as well. The downfall is that outside of dispute resolution mechanisms incorporated into contracts and diplomatic overtures made on their behalf, non-governmental entities involved in outer space activities have few choices in alternative forums to resolve their disputes. However, the legal community has taken notice of this deficiency and addressed it with the adoption of new rules for arbitration keyed specifically for issues arising from outer space activities, both in the context of resolving disputes pertaining to treaties in the diplomatic world and contracts in the private sector.<br />

MEANWHILE, in the developing world, emerging economies like India and China are now pursuing aggressive climate policies. “Two years ago the assumption was that the developed world would have to lead, but now China, India and Brazil have jumped in with enthusiasm, and are moving ahead,” said Nick Robins of HSBC Global Research. Buffeted by two years of treacherous weather that they are less able to handle than richer nations — from floods in India to water shortages in China — developing countries are feeling vulnerable. Scientists agree that extreme weather events will be more severe and frequent on a warming planet, and insurance companies have already documented an increase. So perhaps it is no surprise that regard for climate change as “a very serious problem” has risen significantly in many developing nations over the past two years. A 2010 Pew survey showed that more than 70 percent of people in China, India and South Korea were willing to pay more for energy in order to address climate change. The number in the United States was 38 percent. China’s 12th five-year plan, for 2011-2015, directs intensive investment to low carbon industries. In contrast, in the United States, there is “no prospect of moving ahead” at a national legislative level, Mr. Robins said, although some state governments are addressing the issue.<br />

The US role in international negotiation International discussions have great value; however, they need to be placed in context and seen for what they are. In the climate change arena, they have been successful as education tools, increasing awareness and bringing new items to the agenda. International climate conferences garner intense media attention. This interest peaked in 2009 at Copenhagen as President Obama joined the negotiation table but has since diminished, with far less interest domestically in the conferences at Cancun and the Durban meetings. And if these conferences serve as great climate change teaching moments, they have been less successful as venues for policy making. There have certainly been accomplishments, but nations are still at odds over fundamental issues, such as the point at which developing countries should be required to meet emission reductions. The United States has been heavily criticized for its approach to these international negotiations. Given the inability of Congress to craft and pass domestic climate legislation, however, a US decision to sign onto a binding international agreement remains a distant dream. The partisan standoff that prevents meaningful climate and energy policy at the national level will continue to hinder US negotiators’ ability to influence international negotiations and to join future agreements. In the short term, the real, substantive action in climate policy and management will involve regulation at the national and, increasingly, local levels as well as advances in technology.<br />

<span class="Underline">Moscow has longstanding trade and diplomatic connections with Iran and thus attempts to pose as the middleman in the six-party nuclear talks that include U.S., China, Russia, Great Britain, France, and Germany (known in the diplomatic lingo as P-5+1, after the Permanent Five members of the UNSC). However, as we wrote last year, the Kremlin was reluctant to make any compromises with the White House on Iran, even when Russia agreed to support the watered-down UNSC sanctions and cancelled the S-300 anti-aircraft missile sale to the ayatollahs. Today as before, Moscow is trying to fly diplomatic cover for Tehran, which is a Russian arms customer and a geopolitical battering ram to pound the U.S. and its allies in the Persian Gulf. Moscow’s efforts to protect Iran from international pressure actively undermine weapons of mass destruction (WMD) nonproliferation efforts, which used to be an area of active cooperation between Russia and the West. Even the USSR refrained from sharing or selling its nuclear “know-how”—with the exception of China in the 1950s—as a part of its nuclear deterrence strategy based on the UNSC P-5 monopoly. That has changed in the last 20 years. Even though last year Russia supported sanctions against Iran and cancelled the deal to sell the S-300 missile complex to Tehran, today the progress is being reversed, to the satisfaction of the Russian military-industrial complex. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Which naturally leads to relations with the U.S., the subject of the penultimate chapter of Shirk's book. Beijing has an incentive to maintain good relations with the U.S. – the PRC would suffer greatly from American economic sanctions let alone military hostility, and &quot;the best way for China to rise peacefully is to behave like a responsible power and accommodate to the current superpower, the United States.&quot; If only life was so simple. Warns Shirk: &quot;on the other hand, inside China, other leaders, the public, and the military expect Chinese leaders to stand up to the United States. Nationalist ardor runs high, fanned by government propaganda and the commercial media and Internet. The United States, as the dominant power in the world, is the natural target of suspicion and resentment in China, just as it is in many other countries, particularly after the American invasion of Iraq. A Chinese political leader who takes a principled stand against the United States always wins more points than one who gives in to it.&quot; Where does the U.S. go from here? As is so often the case in international relations, responsible statesmanship is necessary on both sides of the Pacific. Moreover, she adds, &quot;only by understanding the dangers of China's domestic fragility and incorporating this understanding into their policies can Chinese and American decision makers avoid a catastrophic war.&quot; She advocates a series of sensible steps – focusing on Chinese international behavior, downplaying American military power, demonstrating respect for China, working in Chinese-Taiwanese relations, and not overreacting to China's economic rise. But that's not enough. Shirk wants to maintain &quot;a strong military presence&quot; in the region and opposes building up Japan as a military power. As she notes, &quot;Preventing war with a rising China is one of the most difficult foreign policy challenges our country faces.&quot; That being the case, Washington should emphasize conflict avoidance, stepping back militarily while shifting defense responsibilities onto allied and friendly states. Perhaps the most important duty for U.S. policymakers today is to distinguish between vital interests, such as defending America, and peripheral interests, such as attempting to dictate events in East Asia in the face of a rising China. The world in which America can micro-manage international events is disappearing. Washington, too, must learn to accommodate. And America's interest will best be served by stepping back from confrontation where its vital interests are not involved. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Small conflicts with China could escalate into a nuclear conflict – err on the side of caution</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Fisher 11 (Max, Associate Editor at the Atlantic, Editor of the International Channel, “5 Most Likely Ways the US and China Could Spark Accidental Nuclear War”) </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">There's a near-infinite number of small-scale conflicts that could come up between the U.S. and China, and though none of them should escalate any higher than a few tough words between diplomats, it's the unpredictable events that are the most dangerous. In 1983 alone, the U.S. and Soviet Union almost went to war twice over bizarre and unforeseeable events. In September, the Soviet Union shot down a Korean airliner it mistook for a spy plane; first Soviet officials feared the U.S. had manufactured the incident as an excuse to start a war, then they refused to admit their error, nearly pushing the U.S. to actually start war. Two months later, Soviet spies misread an elaborate U.S. wargame (which the U.S. had unwisely kept secret) as preparations for an unannounced nuclear hit on Moscow, nearly leading them to launch a preemptive strike. In both cases, one of the things that ultimately diverted disaster was the fact that both sides clearly nderstood the others' red lines -- as long as they didn't cross them, they could remain confident there would be no nuclear war. But the U.S. and China have not yet clarified their red lines for nuclear strikes. The kinds of bizarre, freak accidents that the U.S. and Soviet Union barely survived in 1983 might well bring today's two Pacific powers into conflict -- unless, of course, they can clarify their rules. Of the many ways that the U.S. and China could stumble into the nightmare scenario that neither wants, here are five of the most likely. Any one of these appears to be extremely unlikely in today's world. But that -- like the Soviet mishaps of the 1980s -- is exactly what makes them so dangerous.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">But what would that &quot;victory&quot; entail? An attack with these Chinese nuclear weapons would immediately slaughter at least 10 million Americans in a great storm of blast and fire, while leaving many more dying horribly of sickness and radiation poisoning. The Chinese death toll in a nuclear war would be far higher. Both nations would be reduced to smoldering, radioactive wastelands. Also, radioactive debris sent aloft by the nuclear explosions would blot out the sun and bring on a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; around the globe -- destroying agriculture, creating worldwide famine, and generating chaos and destruction. Moreover, in another decade the extent of this catastrophe would be far worse. The Chinese government is currently expanding its nuclear arsenal, and by the year 2020 it is expected to more than double its number of nuclear weapons that can hit the United States. The U.S. government, in turn, has plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars &quot;modernizing&quot; its nuclear weapons and nuclear production facilities over the next decade. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">China will boost international scientific exchanges and cooperation in space research as part of its five-year strategy to increase investment in space. &quot;China will strengthen the development of its space science research system, upgrade the quality of space science research and enhance popularisation of space science knowledge,&quot; according to a white paper on China's space activities published on 29 December by the state council, equivalent to the cabinet. It said the aim in the next five years was &quot;to actively build a space technology innovative system featuring integration of the space industry, academia and the research community, with space science and technology enterprises and research institutions as the main participants&quot;. The white paper outlines ambitious plans to launch space laboratories, manned space flights and space freighters, and says China will start research on a preliminary plan for a human landing on the moon. &quot;In the next five years, China will strengthen its basic capacities of the space industry, accelerate research on leading-edge technology, and continue to implement important space scientific and technological projects, including human space flight, lunar exploration, high-resolution Earth observation systems, satellite navigation and positioning systems, new generation launch vehicles and other priority projects in key fields,&quot; the white paper said. Cooperation will mainly be in the fields of astronomy, space physics, micro-gravity science, space life science, deep space exploration and space debris. Funding Official statements in the past put China's annual space budget at less than a tenth of NASA's. However, China appears to be willing to put substantial resources into space science in the near future. Although no figures have been mentioned so far, the white paper speaks of a guarantee of &quot;sustainable and steady financial investment for space activities&quot;. It said the government would gradually establish a space funding system &quot;from different sources&quot;, which would also provide larger amounts of money for important projects linked to space, satellite technologies and &quot;frontier technologies and basic researches&quot;. The aim, according to the government, is to &quot;strengthen innovation capability in space science and technology&quot; and to focus on &quot;leapfrog development in space science and technology by way of making new breakthroughs in core technologies and resource integration&quot;. Using spacecraft, China will study the properties of black holes and physical laws under extreme conditions, explore properties of dark matter particles, and test basic theories of quantum mechanics. It will also conduct scientific experiments on microgravity and space life science, and explore and forecast the space environment. Technologies will also be developed for monitoring space debris and collision warning systems. The country will experiment with digital simulation of space debris collisions, and build a system to protect spacecraft from space debris. Cooperation China already has a bilateral space cooperation programme with Brazil and bilateral agreements with Britain, France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine as well as the European Space Agency. International cooperation will be based on mutual benefit and peaceful utilisation of space, a foreign ministry spokesman emphasised during a regular briefing for the foreign media in Beijing on the same day the white paper was released. Peaceful uses include Earth observation and Earth science and research, disaster prevention and mitigation, deep-space exploration, space debris and other areas. For example, China has been providing free receiving stations for meteorological satellite broadcasting systems and meteorological information analysis and processing. A data-receiving station of the Sino-Brazilian Earth Resources Satellite Programme was established in South Africa with Chinese assistance, and another for receiving environmental and disaster data from Chinese satellites has been set up in Thailand. The latest white paper, the third on space since 2000, stressed regional space cooperation in the Asia Pacific in part through the Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organisation established in 2008. It also said China would support &quot;other regional space cooperation around the world, reinforcing space cooperation with developing countries and valuing space cooperation with developed countries&quot;. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The 2008—2010 global financial crisis further emboldened this line of thinking, as many argued that ‘‘state-monopoly capitalism’’ (guojia longduan zibenzhuyi) had finally brought the world economy to the brink of disaster, just as Lenin predicted in 1917. Fang Ning, Director of the CASS Institute of Political Science, argues that this phenomenon actually dates to the 2003 Iraq War, which marked the arrival of an era of ‘‘new imperialism.’’ For Fang and others, the war indicated that Deng Xiaoping’s era of ‘‘peace and development’’ was over.9 The foreign policy of George W. Bush’s administration gave rise to a revival of Marxist or more accurately neo-Leninist studies of international relations and a number of articles and books on ‘‘new imperialism.’’10 Although they regurgitated much of the analysis from the 1980s,11 the new scholarship went much further in dissecting both the new developments in ‘‘state-monopoly capitalism’’ and the international order. These authors also accuse China’s policy toward the United States of being far too soft, and categorize a Sino—U.S. ‘‘strategic partnership’’ as an illusion.

<span class="Underline">Outside of global economic issues, national security concerns are strongly tied to the health of the United States' relationship with China, which is adversely impacted by rising trade tensions. The two countries posing the greatest contemporary threats to the security of the United States are Iran and North Korea, 232 and China's cooperation in confronting these nations is of paramount importance. In August 2009, American officials carried a message concerning Iran to Chinese officials in Beijing: &quot;if Iran were to be kept from developing nuclear weapons, China would have to throw more diplomatic weight behind the cause.&quot; 233 Chinese ties with Iran have already worried members of the American government. 234 After China agreed with [*331] Iran on a series of billion dollar energy deals, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Howard L. Berman (D-CA28), called them &quot;'exactly the wrong message' to send to an Iran that seemed determined to flout international nuclear rules.&quot; 235 As one anonymous Chinese official stated, concerning China's non-cooperation with American sanctions against Iran, &quot;China is not anxious to jump on this American train.&quot; 236 This hesitancy is due to the difference between how the two countries each view the threat of a nuclear Iran. 237 America sees Iran as a major obstacle to energy agreements, as well as a threat to global stability and allies in the Middle East, most notably Israel. 238 China, meanwhile, is not directly threatened by Iran and may benefit if Iran forces America to commit even more military focus and energy to control the Middle East. 239 Chinese-Iranian economic and energy ties also continue to grow. China has committed $ 120 billion to Iranian energy projects, while Iran has been one of the biggest purchasers of heavy manufacturing equipment from China. 240 These growing political and economic ties have already caused China to prevent the United Nations from imposing even more serious sanctions against Iran. 241 As a permanent member of the Security Council, China has veto power over any proposal, 242 and so far has been hesitant to side with the United States in imposing stiff sanctions against Iran's nuclear program. 243 China has agreed to a few sanctions against Iran, but only after watering down the initial proposal and waiting for approval from Russia (Iran's other close ally on the Security Council). 244 The question becomes, if China is not eager to help America's quest to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons in the first place, what would happen with a souring U.S.-China relationship? The situation may be even more serious when one considers North Korea. China has been allied with North Korea since the Korean War in the early 1950s. 245 China has helped sustain Kim Jong-Il's regime since his ascendancy to power in 1994 by, among other things, opposing harsh international economic [*332] sanctions in the hope of keeping Kim Jong-Il in power. 246 China is also North Korea's biggest trading partner and its main source of food, military equipment, and fuel. 247 As North Korea's closest and most important ally, 248 China is in a unique position to curtail Jong-Il's nuclear ambitions. After North Korea tested nuclear weapons in October 2006 and May 2009, China began to rethink the nature of its relationship with North Korea. 249 After each nuclear test, China agreed to United Nations Security Council resolutions imposing tough sanctions aimed at inhibiting North Korea's nuclear program. 250 This does not mean, however, that China has completely severed ties with North Korea; in fact, quite the opposite is true. 251 Selig S. Harrison, Asia Program Director at the Center for International Policy, has said that the Chinese are &quot;'doing just what they have to do and no more' in terms of punishing North Korea.&quot; 252 China's diplomatic priorities already weigh against helping the United States control North Korea's nuclear ambitions. For China, having a friendly country to its northeast is more important than aiding this American effort. 253 North Korea creates a &quot;buffer zone between China and democratic South Korea,&quot; home to a large garrison of U.S. troops. 254 In addition, this allows China to divert a large amount of military strength to dealing with Taiwan and its independence movement. 255 China is also largely interested in appeasing North Korea and preventing war from breaking out on the Korean peninsula. 256 If North Korea provokes a war, which it is certainly capable of doing independently, China would likely experience much damage from military operations, in addition to an extremely large flood of North Korean refugees moving over the border. 257 China's leverage over North Korea is also vital to the United States' goals in the region. First, North Korea relies heavily on China for food, goods, and fuel. 258 Some estimate that China provides North Korea with ninety percent of its energy imports, eighty percent of its consumer goods, and forty-five [*333] percent of its food. 259 Because of this, China is in a unique position to bring North Korea to any negotiating tables. The Six-Party Talks are a series of negotiations designed to end North Korea's nuclear program and involve the United States, China, North and South Korea, Japan, and Russia. 260 China has already brought North Korea to the Six-Party Talks on multiple occasions, 261 and it is hard to imagine North Korea willingly cooperating without at least some prompting from China. Second, China has an ambiguous defense pact with North Korea. 262 Under the 1961 Sino-North Korean Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, China is compelled to intervene for the defense of North Korea against unprovoked aggression. 263 China, however, is allowed to make an &quot;authoritative interpretation of the principle for intervention.&quot; 264 The likelihood that China does in fact intervene may be tied to China's relationships with the rest of the world at the time, as &quot;China now places more value on national interest, over alliances blinded by ideology.&quot; 265 Consequently, China may choose to remain neutral during any conflict between North Korea and the United States to preserve diplomatic relations, or, if current U.S.-China ties are weak, China may emerge as a strong voice of dissent against western interference in Asian politics. 266 It is very possible that China-not the United States-holds the key to preventing both Iran and North Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons, and therefore, it is in America's best interest to ensure China's cooperation on all fronts. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">However, the announcement suggests the US will not now sell Taiwan a newer generation of F-16, as Taipei had hoped. US officials said the F-16 A/B fighters will undergo a retrofit which will bring them up to the same standards as the more advanced C/D models. &quot;After the upgrade, the air force's combat capability will be advanced hugely,&quot; Taiwanese Defence Minister Kao Hua-chu said at a late-night press conference in Taipei. Despite improved relations between Taiwan and China, Beijing continues to build up its military strength. And that build-up is widely seen as targeted at Taiwan, to warn the island it still claims as its province against becoming formally independent. Analysts say Washington has become reluctant to sell Taiwan big-ticket items in recent years, for fear of angering Beijing. The US needs China's co-operation on many issues - from trade, to North Korea and buying US bonds to deal with its debt. Washington faces a tough balancing act trying to juggle its relationship with China and its commitment to help its longtime ally Taiwan defend itself. The defence ministry said Taiwan remained under threat from China's military expansion. &quot;Improving our defence capability is a crucial and only measure to sustain regional security and stable development across the strait,&quot; it said in a statement. But Taiwan also said it would continue its attempts to purchase more than 60 of the C/D planes, which are considered more of a match for China's latest war planes. Taipei said that decision was still pending in the US and urged officials to agree to it. Washington's decision will now pass to Congress for approval. Some analysts say the move is designed to appease Beijing, which had warned that relations would suffer if the sale went ahead. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Although simulating a Chinese D-Day on Taiwan might be a tidy demonstration of the PLA's core mission, the armed forces today are developing capabilities and doctrine that will eventually enable them to protect China's expanding global interests. The PLA's Second Artillery Corps and science-and-technology units are increasingly capable in space and cyberspace operations, and they have honed the ability to launch and operate satellites to improve communications and intelligence collection. New air and naval platforms and capabilities, such as aerial refueling and new classes of ships, also increase the PLA's ability to deploy abroad. Official Chinese military writings now pay increasing attention to a greater range of military missions, focusing not only on China's territorial integrity, but on its global interests. From oil rigs in Nigeria to a crude-oil pipeline under construction that will connect Yunnan's capital city to Burma's port of Sittwe on the Bay of Bengal, Beijing thinks it must be able to defend its people, infrastructure, and investments in some of the world's most volatile places -- much as the British did in the 1800s. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The two dozen senior politicians who walk the halls of Zhongnanhai, the compound of the Chinese Communist Party’s leadership in Beijing, are worried. What was inconceivable a year ago now threatens their rule: an economy in freefall. Exports, critical to China’s searing economic growth, have plunged. Thousands of factories and businesses, especially those in the prosperous coastal regions, have closed. In the last six months of 2008, 10 million workers, plus 1 million new college graduates, joined the already gigantic ranks of the country’s unemployed. During the same period, the Chinese stock market lost 65 percent of its value, equivalent to $3 trillion. The crisis, President Hu Jintao said recently, “is a test of our ability to control a complex situation, and also a test of our party’s governing ability.”With this rapid downturn, the Chinese Communist Party suddenly looks vulnerable. Since Deng Xiaoping initiated economic reforms three decades ago, the party’s legitimacy has relied upon its ability to keep the economy running at breakneck pace. If China is no longer able to maintain a high growth rate or provide jobs for its ever growing labor force, massive public dissatisfaction and social unrest could erupt. No one realizes this possibility more than the handful of people who steer China’s massive economy. Double-digit growth has sheltered them through a SARS epidemic, massive earthquakes, and contamination scandals. Now, the crucial question is whether they are equipped to handle an economic crisis of this magnitude—and survive the political challenges it will bring. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the People’s Republic, and the ruling party is no longer led by one strongman, like Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping. Instead, the Politburo and its Standing Committee, China’s most powerful body, are run by two informal coalitions that compete against each other for power, influence, and control over policy. Competition in the Communist Party is, of course, nothing new. But the jockeying today is no longer a zero-sum game in which a winner takes all. It is worth remembering that when Jiang Zemin handed the reins to his successor, Hu Jintao, in 2002, it marked the first time in the republic’s history that the transfer of power didn’t involve bloodshed or purges. What’s more, Hu was not a protégé of Jiang’s; they belonged to competing factions. To borrow a phrase popular in Washington these days, post-Deng China has been run by a team of rivals. This internal competition was enshrined as party practice a little more than a year ago. In October 2007, President Hu surprised many China watchers by abandoning the party’s normally straightforward succession procedure and designating not one but two heirs apparent. The Central Committee named Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang—two very different leaders in their early 50s—to the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee, where the rulers of China are groomed. The future roles of these two men, who will essentially share power after the next party congress meets in 2012, have since been refined: Xi will be the candidate to succeed the president, and Li will succeed Premier Wen Jiabao. The two rising stars share little in terms of family background, political association, leadership skills, and policy orientation. But they are each heavily involved in shaping economic policy—and they are expected to lead the two competing coalitions that will be relied upon to craft China’s political and economic trajectory in the next decade and beyond. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Since the Party’s life is “above all else,” it would not be surprising if the CCP resorts to the use of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons in its attempt to postpone its life. The CCP, that disregards human life, would not hesitate to kill two hundred million Americans, coupled with seven or eight hundred million Chinese, to achieve its ends. The “speech,” free of all disguises, lets the public see the CCP for what it really is: with evil filling its every cell, the CCP intends to fight all of mankind in its desperate attempt to cling to life. And that is the theme of the “speech.” The theme is murderous and utterly evil. We did witness in China beggars who demanded money from people by threatening to stab themselves with knives or prick their throats on long nails. But we have never, until now, seen a rogue who blackmails the world to die with it by wielding biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. Anyhow, the bloody confession affirmed the CCP’s bloodiness: a monstrous murderer, who has killed 80 million Chinese people, now plans to hold one billion people hostage and gamble with their lives.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">A similar argument may be made with respect to China. China is a country that has had its share of upheavals in the past. While there is no expectation today of renewed internal turmoil, it is important to remember that closed authoritarian societies are subject to deep crisis in moments of sudden change. The breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the turmoil that has ravaged many members of the former communist bloc are examples of what could happen to China. A severe economic crisis, rebellions in Tibet and Xinjiang, a reborn democracy movement and a party torn by factions could be the ingredients of an unstable situation. A vulnerable Chinese leadership determined to bolster its shaky position by an aggressive policy toward India or the United States or both might become involved in a major crisis with India, perhaps engage in nuclear saber-rattling. That would encourage India to adopt a stronger nuclear posture, possibly with American assistance. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Few if any experts think China and Taiwan, North Korea and South Korea, or India and Pakistan are spoiling to fight. But even a minor miscalculation by any of them could destabilize Asia, jolt the global economy and even start a nuclear war. India, Pakistan and China all have nuclear weapons, and North Korea may have a few, too. Asia lacks the kinds of organizations, negotiations and diplomatic relationships that helped keep an uneasy peace for five decades in Cold War Europe. “Nowhere else on Earth are the stakes as high and relationships so fragile,” said Bates Gill, director of northeast Asian policy studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. “We see the convergence of great power interest overlaid with lingering confrontations with no institutionalized security mechanism in place. There are elements for potential disaster.” In an effort to cool the region’s tempers, President Clinton, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger all will hopscotch Asia’s capitals this month. For America, the stakes could hardly be higher. There are 100,000 U.S. troops in Asia committed to defending Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, and the United States would instantly become embroiled if Beijing moved against Taiwan or North Korea attacked South Korea. While Washington has no defense commitments to either India or Pakistan, a conflict between the two could end the global taboo against using nuclear weapons and demolish the already shaky international nonproliferation regime. In addition, globalization has made a stable Asia _ with its massive markets, cheap labor, exports and resources _ indispensable to the U.S. economy. Numerous U.S. firms and millions of American jobs depend on trade with Asia that totaled $600 billion last year, according to the Commerce Department.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Chinese leaders believe domestic foes, their foreign backers and Western governments are scheming to undermine and ultimately topple the Communist Party. Recent speeches and articles from security officials echo with warnings of subversive plots backed by Western &quot;anti-China&quot; forces. Shortly before China's clampdown ramped up in February, a senior domestic security official, Chen Jiping, warned that &quot;hostile Western forces&quot; -- alarmed by the country's rise -- were marshalling human rights issues to attack Party control. Many of those that police interrogators quizzed Liu about were already detained in the crackdown that gained momentum in February. They included the detained artist Ai Teng Biao, a well-known rights lawyer, and Wen Tao, a reporter who is a friend and helper to Ai, said Liu. &quot;They also asked a little about Ai Weiwei and showed me a picture of him from a party,&quot; he said. &quot;I told them I didn't know anything about any of them.&quot; Officials have said Ai faces investigation for &quot;suspected economic crimes.&quot; But his sister, Gao Ge, dismissed that as a ruse and said Ai was detained for his political advocacy. &quot;The police officer who led the searches of his workshop was from state security. That says a lot,&quot; said Gao. &quot;If this is just an ordinary investigation, why haven't we heard from Ai Weiwei?&quot; HISTORY LESSONS China's government does indeed confront discontented citizens and groups who want to end one-party rule, and the United States and its allies make no secret that they want China to evolve into a liberal democracy. But what outsiders may see as a loose, disparate group of dissidents, bloggers, lawyers, and grassroots agitators, China's security police treat as a subversive, Western-backed coalition with the potential to erupt into outright opposition. &quot;(In China) there's a tendency to look for the 'black hand' and to look for an organization,&quot; said Joshua Rosenzweig, a Hong Kong-based researcher for the Dui Hua Foundation, a U.S. group that works for better treatment and the release of Chinese political prisoners. &quot;Their mentality is still based on the conspiracy of the revolutionary cell,&quot; Rosenzweig said in a telephone interview. &quot;The idea of a counter-revolutionary clique has never really gone away in China.&quot; The Party's alarm about domestic threats inspired by the anti-authoritarian uprisings across the Middle East and north Africa grew after an overseas Chinese website, Boxun.com, publicized calls for peaceful protests across China emulating the &quot;Jasmine Revolution.&quot; That fear has deep historical roots. In official eyes, the pro-democracy protests against the Party in 1989 were the doing of counter-revolutionary agitators backed by the United States and other Western powers. More recently, said two sources in Beijing, officials circulated documents claiming to show a Western conspiracy was behind the award of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, a veteran of the 1989 protests. Those sources spoke on condition on anonymity. &quot;It's not just a general sense that the Western governments supported the Nobel decision; it's a real belief that it was dreamed up in Washington as a way to attack China,&quot; said one of those sources, a researcher. INTERNET POWER Official Chinese fears of Western-backed subversion have been reinforced by the view that &quot;color revolutions&quot; that swept Central Asia several years ago were Western-promoted rehearsals for a similar subversive assault on China. Chen, the security official, was a senior producer of a documentary shown to officials several years ago to stress the threat of Western-backed &quot;color revolution&quot; subversion. The call for a &quot;Jasmine Revolution&quot; in particular brings together two of the Communist Party's great fears: Western-backed opposition and the power of the Internet to influence and possibly mobilize China's 453 million users. &quot;What's been going on in north Africa and the Middle East is a prime example in some people's eyes of the color revolution,&quot; said Rosenzweig, the Hong Kong-based rights researcher. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Climate negotiators might also worry too much when major powers stall or sit on the sidelines, as the United States currently does. The history of arms negotiations shows that even if major powers remain aloof, they will often follow the rules set in agreements they once shunned, even as they avoid the formalities. Although the 1998 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has yet to enter into force legally, for example, only the three new nuclear weapon states have conducted nuclear tests since the treaty was signed; the six older nuclear powers have not tested a nuclear weapon for more than fifteen years. Finally, climate change talks, which involve a problem with the potential to disrupt the life of every human on earth, must graduate into the elite arena. They should be directly guided by powerful ministries, which can make commitments and sell them at home in ways most environmental authorities cannot. As with nuclear arms reductions, controlling greenhouse gas emissions is a messy real-world challenge that will probably require an evolving progression of messy real-world solutions. But if the climate establishment can acknowledge more variation of approaches and entry points, it increases its chances of realizing its most important goals, even if it does not tie a nice, neat bow on them. </span><br />

If the survival of nuclear weapons requires their dispersal and concealment, do not problems of command and control become harder to solve? Americans think so because we think in terms of large nuclear arsenals. Small nuclear powers will neither have them nor need them. Lesser nuclear states might deploy, say, ten real weapons and ten dummies, while permitting other countries to infer that the numbers are larger. The adversary need only believe that some warheads may survive his attack and be visited on him. That belief should not be hard to create without making command and control unreliable. All nuclear countries must live through a time when their forces are crudely designed. All countries have so far been able to control them. Relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. and later among the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, were at their bitterest just when their nuclear forces were in early stages of development, were unbalanced, were crude and presumably hard to control. Why should we expect new nuclear states to experience greater difficulties than the old ones were able to cope with? Moreover, although some of the new nuclear states may be economically and technically backward, they will either have an expert and highly trained group of scientists and engineers or they will not produce nuclear weapons. Even if they buy the weapons, they will have to hire technicians to maintain and control them. We do not have to wonder whether they will take good care of their weapons. They have every incentive to do so. They will not want to risk retaliation because one or more of their warheads accidentally strikes another country.<br />

No accidental launch and no retaliation- failsafe systems<br />
Slocombe, 2009 (Walter B., Former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, “De-Altering: Diagnoses, Prescriptions, and Side Effects”, Discussion Paper Presented at the Seminar on Reframing De-Alert: Decreasing the Operational Readiness of Nuclear Weapon Systems in the U.S.-Russia Context, East-West Institute, June,<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1250:http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Slocombe.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Slocombe.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Slocombe.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1250 -->)<br />
<br />
Let’s start with Technical Failure – the focus of a great deal of the advocacy, or at least of stress on past incidents of failures of safety and control mechanisms.Much of the “de-alerting” literature points to a succession of failures to follow proper procedures and draw from that history the inference that a relatively simple procedural failure could produce a nuclear detonation. The argument is essentially that nuclear weapons systems are sufficiently susceptible of pure accident (including human error or failure at operational/field level) that it is essential to take measures that have the effect of making it necessary to undertake a prolonged reconfiguration of the elements of the nuclear weapons force for a launch or detonation to be physically possible. Specific measures said to serve this objective include separating the weapons from their launchers, burying silo doors, removal of fuzing or launching mechanisms, deliberate avoidance of maintenance measures need to permit rapid firing, and the like. . My view is that this line of action is unnecessary in its own terms and highly problematic from the point of view of other aspects of the problem and that there is a far better option that is largely already in place, at least in the US force – the requirement of external information – a code not held by the operators -- to arm the weapons. Advocates of other, more “physical,” measures often describe the current arrangement as nuclear weapons being on a “hair trigger.” That is – at least with respect to US weapons – a highly misleading characterization. The “hair trigger” figure of speech confuses “alert” status – readiness to act quickly on orders -- with susceptibility to inadvertent action. The “hair trigger” image implies that a minor mistake – akin to jostling a gun – will fire the weapon. The US StratCom commander had a more accurate metaphor when he recently said that US nuclear weapons are less a pistol with a hair trigger than like a pistol in a holster with the safety turned on – and he might have added that in the case of nuclear weapons the “safety” is locked in place by a combination lock that can only be opened and firing made possible if the soldier carrying the pistol receives a message from his chain of command giving him the combination. Whatever other problems the current nuclear posture of the US nuclear force may present, it cannot reasonably be said to be on a “hair trigger.” Since the 1960s the US has taken a series of measures to insure that US nuclear weapons cannot be detonated without the receipt of both external information and properly authenticated authorization to use that information. These devices – generically Permissive Action Links or “PALs” – are in effect combination locks that keep the weapons locked and incapable of detonation unless and until the weapons’ firing mechanisms have been unlocked following receipt of a series of numbers communicated to the operators from higher authority. Equally important in the context of a military organization, launch of nuclear weapons (including insertion of the combinations) is permitted only where properly authorized by an authenticated order. This combination of reliance on discipline and procedure and on receipt of an unlocking code not held by the military personnel in charge of the launch operation is designed to insure that the system is “fail safe,” i.e., that whatever mistakes occur, the result will not be a nuclear explosion. Moreover, in recent years, both the US and Russia, as well as Britain and China, have modified their procedures so that even if a nuclear-armed missile were launched, it would go not to a “real” target in another country but – at least in the US 5case - to empty ocean. In addition to the basic advantage of insuring against a nuclear detonation in a populated area, the fact that a missile launched in error would be on flight path that diverged from a plausible attacking trajectory should be detectable by either the US or the Russian warning systems, reducing the possibility of the accident being perceived as a deliberate attack. De-targeting, therefore, provides a significant protection against technical error.5 These arrangements – PALs and their equivalents coupled with continued observance of the agreement made in the mid-90s on “de-targeting” – do not eliminate the possibility of technical or operator-level failures, but they come very close to providing absolute assurance that such errors cannot lead to a nuclear explosion or be interpreted as the start of a deliberate nuclear attack.6 The advantage of such requirements for external information to activate weapons is of course that the weapons remain available for authorized use but not susceptible of appropriation or mistaken use. The drawback from a deterrence and operational point of view is, of course, that the system for transmitting the information must not be susceptible of interruption – that is, there must be assurance that an authorized decision maker will be able to act and have the decision – and the accompanying authenticated orders and unlock combinations – communicated to and received by the operators of the weapon systems. Accordingly, a system of combination-locked safeties requires a highly survivable network for decision and communication with the operators. Otherwise there would be pressures for early transmission of the codes, with their insertion subject to a later execute order or even more dangerous, pre-delegation of authority to issue the execute orders. In this, as in other aspects of measures to meet the “never” requirement, a highly capable and highly survivable command and control system is essential.<br />

Leaders would disbelieve reports of attack- solves launch<br />

<br />
There is an offsetting factor of crucial significance, however. While the risk of false warning has increased, the danger that Russia or the United States would actually launch on that false warning has declined dramatically. The reason is that the leaders of these two countries would presumably heavily discount if not entirely dismiss reports of an attack, simply because the reports would be so incredible. Russia and the United States are no longer enemies. That either country would deliberately attack the other is so utterly implausible that a neutral observer would rightly suppose that their top leaders would rise above the noise, emotion and time pressure of a reported incoming nuclear strike. These leaders cannot mechanically tie their actions to any warning and intelligence network, however highly touted it may be. At their lofty pay grade, what they think of the warning information would be inevitably and properly weighed by the background information they bring to it. Their prior opinion about the other side’s good or ill intentions must be brought to bear on the situation, and that prior opinion today surely would cause them to disbelieve the warning and delay the fateful decision long enough to discover that the alarm was indeed false. On the other hand, a continuing stream of attack indications from multiple reliable warning sensors would compel a rationally calculating leader to believe that in all likelihood an attack actually is underway. The stream of data would compel a dramatic revision of the initial disbelief until the harsh reality sank in. In other words, the effect of prior beliefs and psychology on the process of nuclear decisionmaking is very great in the context of launching nuclear missiles on warning that an attack is underway with missiles in the air. That was true during the Cold War, and it is true today.<br />

The cheers from Moscow to America reached their highest level in mid-November 2001, during the meetings between President Bush and President Putin in Washington, D.C., and Texas. Then, step-by-step in December 2001–January 2002, the tone of the Moscow media and Moscow officials lost its sweetness and became a little harsher. In the last two weeks of January, it reminded one of a viper’s hissing. Moscow went crazy at that time for the following reasons (each item confirmable from numerous &quot;angry” articles in the Moscow newspapers, as well as reports from international agencies, for the period Jan. 11–25): America and the West don’t want to write off Russian debts. Moscow is angry: Oh, the New Russian impunity! Moscow should be happy that it is not being punished (at least for the time being) for its role in preparations for the &quot;9-11” attacks. Still, Moscow requires compensation. What for? Perhaps for not downing U.S. military aircraft flying through the Trans-Caucasian corridor? America withdrew from the ABM Treaty and accelerated development of a National Missile Defense (NMD) system. Moscow is very angry. Moreover, Moscow’s anger has in effect &quot;boiled up” in the Beijing officials too. Official and semi-official protests from the two capitals – including tough statements in the government-controlled media – could be counted in the dozens. Russia, despite all its efforts and expectations, didn’t get a decisive voice in NATO and is incapable of stopping NATO's eastward expansion. Again, Moscow is very angry. America and the West don’t want to shut their eyes toward Russian genocidal activity in Chechnya. Moreover, U.S. and U.K. officials are meeting the representatives of Chechen President Maskhadov. Moscow is enraged. America is reluctant to issue a written obligation on the irreversible destruction of most of its nuclear warheads. By the way, is it necessary to issue obligations to a country – such as Russia – that uses any opportunity available for not fulfilling its own obligations? Still, Moscow demonstrates its anger once more. American and NATO troops entered Central Asia and don’t intend to leave it. Now Moscow becomes really mad. It would be enough to mention the Jan. 15 statements of Konstantin Totsky, director of the Federal Border Service, in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, and of the Speaker of the Russian Duma (parliament) Gennady Seleznev.<br />

Strategic relations between the United States and the Russian Federation are of paramount impor tance for the Russian leadership, just as they were for Soviet leaders.[17] From Moscow's perspective, they symbolize the equivalence of the geostrategic potentials of the two powers that have the largest nuclear arsenals. As former Russian President and current Prime Minister Putin has noted: Russia and the United States are the biggest nuclear powers. Our economy might be smaller, but Russia's nuclear potential is still comparable to that of the United States.… It is also important that we have the years of experience, the technology and the production potential, the technological chains and the specialists. Russia is a great nuclear power. No one disputes or doubts this. And the United States and Russia definitely have a shared interest in ensuring security on this planet.[18] After the loss of the former Soviet Union's super power status, Russia has worked diligently to rees­tablish its influence in Eurasia, the Middle East, and even Latin America. While this lost status hurts the Russian pride, it also allows Moscow to blame the U.S. for any problems in international relations. On behalf of Russia, Putin officially asserted that &quot;the stagnation in disarmament…has not come about through any fault of ours.&quot;[19] At the same time, Rus sian leaders have never missed an opportunity to praise the virtue of and their adherence to the remaining regimes and treaties. This is not because of some abstract devotion to so-called international legality[20] or infinite trust in treaty obligations, but because these treaties were usually seen as an effec tive way of preventing the U.S. and other powers from gaining superiority over Russia in advanced weapon systems. In fact, Moscow has demonstrated its readiness to abandon treaty obligations that fail to serve Russian interests.[21]<br />

US-Russian relations don’t solve accidental war – high alert status, economic difficulties, and military supremacy fears<br />

<br />
The past decade has brought significant improvements in the relations between Russia and the United States. At the political level, the changes have been demonstrated most noticeably by Russia’s active assistance in the war on terrorism, even helping the United States to establish basing rights in Central Asia. Changes at the nuclear level have also been notable, particularly the May 2002 signing of the Moscow Treaty in which Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin each agreed to reduce their long-range nuclear warheads to 1,700-2,200 by the year 2012. That will be down from about 6,000 in each country in 2002 and more than 10,000 each in 1990. Despite these positive steps, the grave risk of accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons persists for three reasons. First, both the United States and Russia retain their Cold War postures of keeping their nuclear forces on high alert — ready to launch within a few minutes. Inherent in these postures, which promise the rapid delivery of a massive nuclear retaliatory strike, is the distinct risk of an accidental or unauthorized launch. Second, Russia’s economic difficulties have exacerbated the problem. The country’s mobile nuclear forces — from truck-based and rail-based intercontinental ballistic missiles to submarine-based ballistic missiles — have been decimated in both size and readiness. Far from enhancing U.S. security, these vulnerabilities could push Russia toward a strategy of quickly launching its remaining forces at the first sign of an attack, to ensure their utility. The economic difficulties have also left the early-warning system in tatters and the military with morale and discipline problems. An eroded command-and-control system has increased the risk that nuclear forces could be launched by terrorists or rogue commanders. Third, U.S. strengths intensify Russian weaknesses. The U.S. Trident submarine force, with its accurate missiles and powerful warheads, continued to expand in the 1990s, making a significant portion of Russia’s silo-based missiles vulnerable. As long as Russia could deploy survivable mobile missiles and submarines — which it could in the 1980s — the country ensured that enough of its forces would survive to retaliate against a U.S. strike. But now, with only a few of Russia’s forces able to leave their silos and with sometimes not even one submarine at sea, the United States could deliver not just a retaliatory strike against Russia but also a devastating first strike. This imbalance could further heighten Russia’s feelings of vulnerability and its incentive to launch its forces preemptively. There are three principal scenarios for accidental or unauthorized nuclear use. The first scenario is an intentional unauthorized launch brought about by terrorists or a rogue military commander. The breakdown of order in Russia, the economic difficulties and low morale of its military personnel, and the rise in organized crime and separatist violence have heightened this danger. The second scenario is a missile launched by mistake. Such a mistake could result from a malfunctioning weapon system or a training accident. To date, Russia and the United States have made great efforts to guard against such accidents. Nevertheless, the probability of a mistaken launch has never been zero, and the economic and social problems in Russia have elevated concerns in the West about this problem. The third scenario is a nuclear weapon launched intentionally but based on incorrect or incomplete information. If early-warning systems malfunction, they could signal that an attack is imminent when in fact it is not. Or a nonthreatening event might be misconstrued as an attack. Without a clear, accurate picture of what is happening around the globe, Russia might confuse a benign event (such as a space launch) for a nuclear attack. During the Cold War, Russia and the United States each developed a two-tiered early-warning system (using radar on land and infrared sensors in space) to guard against such events. But Russia’s space-based system is now essentially out of order, leaving the country with only a flawed radar system and greatly increasing the chance that an erroneous indication of attack could be mistaken as real. Thankfully, this concern is mitigated somewhat by the improved state of U.S.-Russian relations. U.S. and Russian political leaders today are less likely to believe they are under deliberate nuclear attack than they were during the tense periods of the Cold War. Despite the end of the Cold War and real improvements in relations, both countries continue to view each other in nuclear terms. The risk of accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons remains unacceptably high. Limiting these dangers will require not merely operational changes in the U.S. and Russian nuclear postures but higher levels of trust and cooperation.<br />

<br />
With the New START treaty ratified, the Obama administration can turn its attention to the real source of nuclear instability among the great powers: China's buildup of conventional ballistic missiles. The latest destabilizing system is China's anti-ship ballistic missile, the &quot;carrier killer&quot; that the head of the U.S. Pacific Command, Adm. Robert Willard, deemed operational last week. During the many upcoming Sino-American summits, including a state visit by President Hu Jintao, the Obama administration should begin pressing China to join the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and stop its missile buildup. Why are China's missiles the greatest source of unease? Because there are no defensive answers that do not risk an immediate escalation of tensions - and Beijing's missile force is soon likely to have the ability to ground Pacific-based U.S. air forces and sink surface ships in Asian waters. China has the world's most ambitious missile modernization program. The anti-ship ballistic missile program that Willard identified is one of many Chinese advances; others include mobile multiple independently targetable (MIRV) intercontinental ballistic missiles, hypersonic post-boost vehicles that remain in the atmosphere and preclude intercept in flight, and a new generation of extended-range, ground-launched land attack cruise missiles. No missile defense program on the horizon is capable of intercepting these systems. Over the past decade China has claimed that it needed to expand its missile force because of ongoing tensions with Taiwan. Relations with Taiwan have warmed, yet Beijing's missile buildup continues. While there is little doubt that Chinese nationalists want to force Taipei into a settlement, it now appears that the Taiwan issue also served as a justification for a massive missile modernization program. For China, a missile-centric military strategy makes sense: Defending against sophisticated ballistic and ground-launched cruise missiles is extremely difficult, and, unlike the United States and Russia, China is not a signatory to the 1987 INF treaty, which precludes only Washington and Moscow from deploying short and intermediate range land-based ballistic and cruise missiles. By building a missile force second to none, China is increasing its capability to coerce its neighbors into resolving political disputes on its terms and the costs of a U.S. response. But the expansion of China's missile force both undermines regional security and exacerbates a classic regional arms race. The only real defense against these weapons is offense, so countries threatened by China's missiles will seek the ability to target the infrastructure supporting missile launches within nuclear-armed China. India and Taiwan are investing in precision strike systems heavily reliant on missiles. Over time, Japan may feel compelled to deploy its own ballistic and cruise missiles. More ominous still is that China's missile buildup could result in the INF's demise. Moscow has already threatened to pull out if China does not sign the treaty. And, with its tactical fighter bases and surface ships increasingly vulnerable, the United States also may have no choice but to abrogate the treaty and deploy mobile land-based missiles - a capability much more difficult for China to attack - to places such as Japan; this could become the only way to deter Chinese aggression. The end of the INF would mean a missile arms race involving four great nuclear powers - India, China, Russia and the United States. Without sustained attention to China's missile force this frightening scenario is becoming more plausible. Even absent a ballistic missile competition among the great powers, strategic stability in Asia is increasingly uncertain. If Washington remains bound by the INF, its response options in a conflict with China are highly escalatory. If U.S. tactical fighter bases and surface ships were hit by Chinese missiles, Washington would have to consider responding by targeting missile assets inside China with intercontinental ballistic missiles. To d1o so, Washington will need to further develop its Prompt Global Strike system, a means of accurately launching long-range missiles from the continental United States. Because such missiles could also be used to carry nuclear weapons, Chinese defenders would have no way of knowing whether the munitions flying toward them were carrying nuclear or conventional warheads. This uncertainty raises the risk of a Chinese nuclear response. China's unrelenting deployment of missiles will soon force Washington to choose between pulling out of the INF or developing longer-range, strategically unstable military responses that are consistent with the agreement. If Washington is serious about reducing the risk of nuclear conflict, it should pursue a third option - pressing China to join the treaty. Failure to do so will quickly make New START irrelevant to nuclear stability.<br />

Proliferation ensures extinction<br />

<br />
Thus, both history and human nature suggest that nuclear deterrence can be expected to fail from time to time, and we are fortunate it has not happened yet. But the threat of nuclear war is not just a matter of a few weapons being used. It could get much worse. Once a conflict reaches the point where nuclear weapons are employed, the stresses felt by the leaderships would rise enormously. These stresses can be expected to further degrade their decision-making. The pressures to force the enemy to stop fighting or to surrender could argue for more forceful and decisive military action, which might be the right thing to do in the circumstances, but maybe not. And the horrors of the carnage already suffered may be seen as justification for visiting the most devastating punishment possible on the enemy.7 Again, history demonstrates how intense conflict can lead the combatants to escalate violence to the maximum possible levels. In the Second World War, early promises not to bomb cities soon gave way to essentially indiscriminate bombing of civilians. The war between Iran and Iraq during the 1980s led to the use of chemical weapons on both sides and exchanges of missiles against each other’s cities. And more recently, violence in the Middle East escalated in a few months from rocks and small arms to heavy weapons on one side, and from police actions to air strikes and armoured attacks on the other. Escalation of violence is also basic human nature. Once the violence starts, retaliatory exchanges of violent acts can escalate to levels unimagined by the participants beforehand.8 Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse. And such anger can lead us to impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible.In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possible with the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild West of the late 1800s. With most, if not all, nations wearing nuclear ‘six-shooters’ on their hips, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations.<br />

Speed difference between proliferating states ensures miscalc, causes war before and after nukes are ready, and leads to bio-weapons<br />

<br />
Many readers are probably willing to accept that nuclear proliferation is such a grave threat to world peace that every effort should be made to avoid it. However, every effort has not been made in the past, and we are talking about much more substantial efforts now. For new and substantially more burdensome efforts to be made to slow or stop nuclear proliferation, it needs to be established that the highly proliferated nuclear world that would sooner or later evolve without such efforts is not going to be acceptable. And, for many reasons, it is not. First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous. Proliferating states will feel great pressures to obtain nuclear weapons and delivery systems before any potential opponent does. Those who succeed in outracing an opponent may consider preemptive nuclear war before the opponent becomes capable of nuclear retaliation. Those who lag behind might try to preempt their opponent’s nuclear programme or defeat the opponent using conventional forces. And those who feel threatened but are incapable of building nuclear weapons may still be able to join in this arms race by building other types of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological weapons. Second, as the world approaches complete<br />
, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the proliferation, the hazards posed by nuclear weapons today will be magnified many times over. Fifty or more nations capable of launching nuclear weapons means that the risk of nuclear accidents that could cause serious damage not only to their own populations and environments, but those of others, is hugely increased. The chances of such weapons falling into the hands of renegade military units or terrorists is far greater, as is the number of nations carrying out hazardous manufacturing and storage activities. Increased prospects for the occasional nuclear shootout Worse still, in a highly proliferated world there would be more frequent opportunities for the use of nuclear weapons. And more frequent opportunities means shorter expected times between conflicts in which nuclear weapons get used, unless the probability of use at any opportunity is actually zero.<br />

Of all the weapons of mass destructioncontinued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. Potentially worse than that, bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation. AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE. Ironically, the Bush administration has just changed the U.S. nuclear doctrine to allow nuclear retaliation against threats upon allies by conventional weapons. The past doctrine allowed such use only as a last resort when our nation’s survival was at stake. Will the new policy also allow easier use of US bioweapons? How slippery is this slope?<br />

The threats are equally apocalyptic. Nuclear war with the Soviet Union was the gravest danger we ever faced, and we came perilously close to it in 1962. Nuclear war with Iran or North Korea would be almost equally dangerous, especially after they have acquired longer-range ballistic missiles capable of hitting U.S. allies and even the U.S. homeland. (Yes, the Soviet Union had thousands of warheads, but you only need a few nukes to cause more damage to us than all the wars we have fought in history, combined, and only a few dozen to effectively wipe out the United States. And if I were a new nuclear power, I wouldn't announce my capability until I already had a few dozen to make sure I could withstand an attack on my arsenal. Which means that North Korea and Iran (when it announces) will almost certainly be existential threats). The difference is that war with them or their proxies may be more likely to actually happen. The latter two countries may be less deterrable, less predictable, and more prone to transfer nuclear technology to proxies and non-state groups, given their history of erratic behavior, sponsoring terrorism, and proliferation. All told, the chances of a nuclear detonation in New York City are higher, not lower, today than twenty years ago. Unfortunately, we do not have a team of patriotic mutant superheroes to avert disaster this time.<br />

Several potential adversaries have the capability to attack the United States with a highaltitude nuclear weapon-generated electromagnetic pulse, and others appear to be pursuing efforts to obtain that capability. A determined adversary can achieve an EMP attack capability without having a high level of sophistication. For example, an adversary would not have to have long-range ballistic missiles to conduct an EMP attack against the United States. Such an attack could be launched from a freighter off the U.S. coast using a short- or medium-range missile to loft a nuclear warhead to high-altitude. Terrorists sponsored by a rogue state could attempt to execute such an attack without revealing the identity of the perpetrators. Iran, the world’s leading sponsor of international terrorism, has practiced launching a mobile ballistic missile from a vessel in the Caspian Sea. Iran has also tested high-altitude explosions of the Shahab-III, a test mode consistent with EMP attack, and described the tests as successful. Iranian military writings explicitly discuss a nuclear EMP attack that would gravely harm the United States. While the Commission does not know the intention of Iran in conducting these activities, we are disturbed by the capability that emerges when we connect the dots. Certain types of relatively low-yield nuclear weapons can be employed to generate potentially catastrophic EMP effects over wide geographic areas, and designs for variants of such weapons may have been illicitly trafficked for a quarter-century. Recently, as reported in the press, United Nations investigators found that the design for an advanced nuclear weapon, miniaturized to fit on ballistic missiles currently in the inventory of Iran, North Korea, and other potentially hostile states, was in the possession of Swiss criminals affiliated with the A.Q. Khan nuclear smuggling network. This fact suggests that other advanced nuclear weapon designs may already be in the possession of hostile states and of states that sponsor terrorism. This fact also suggests that it would be a mistake to judge the status and sophistication of rogue nuclear weapon programs based solely on their indigenous national capabilities, since outside assistance may well have been provided. Depending on the specific characteristics of the EMP attacks, unprecedented cascading failures of major infrastructures could result. In that event, a regional or national recovery would be long and difficult, and would seriously degrade the safety and overall viability of our Nation. The primary avenues for catastrophic damage to the Nation are through our electric power infrastructure and thence into our telecommunications, energy, transportation, and other infrastructures. These, in turn, can seriously impact other important aspects of our Nation’s life, including the financial system; means of getting food, water, and medical care to the citizenry; trade and production of goods and services. The recovery of any one of the key national infrastructures is dependent upon the recovery of others. The longer the outage, the more problematic and uncertain the recovery will be. It is possible for the functional outages to become mutually reinforcing until at some point the degradation of infrastructure could have irreversible effects on the country’s ability to support its population. Given our armed forces’ reliance on critical national infrastructures (e.g., electric power, telecommunications, food and water, etc.), a cascading failure of these infrastructures could seriously jeopardize our military’s ability to execute its missions in support of our national security Projection of military power from air bases and seaports requires electricity, fuel, food and water, and the coordination of military operations depends upon telecommunications and information systems, that are also indispensable to society as a whole. Within the U.S., these assets are in most cases obtained by the military from our critical national infrastructures EMP effects from nuclear bursts are not new threats to our nation. What is different now is that some potential sources of EMP threats are difficult to deter—they can be terrorist groups that have no state identity, have only one or a few weapons, and are motivated to attack the U.S. without regard for their own safety. Potentially hostile states, such as North Korea and Iran, may also be developing the capability to pose an EMP threat to the United States, and may also be unpredictable and difficult to deter.<br />

Those who opposed military preparedness before World Wars I and II used this same argument—that German aggression and world war was impossible because of the economic interdependence of European states and the world. Economic interdependence did not stop the world wars from happening. Nor did China’s economic partnership with the United States stop a Chinese general, during the 1996 Taiwan Straits Crisis, from threatening a nuclear strike against Los Angeles.15 While the United States no longer views Russia and China as enemies, the reverse is not also true. Russia and China in public statements and military writings continue to portray the US as a potential enemy, often as a reckless aggressor seeking to impose a New World Order dominated by the United States.16 Russian and Chinese military writings are replete with scenarios and references to making EMP attacks against the United States.17 Indeed, during the 1999 Balkans Crisis, leaders of the Russian Duma raised the specter of a Russian EMP attack that would paralyze the United States, in order to stop US bombing of Serbia.18 In 2009, shortly after the election of President Obama, Russian President Medvedev threatened to neutralize NATO’s deploying missile shield by targeting nuclear weapons on radars and interceptors in Poland and the Czech Republic, and by “radioelectronic means”—Russian parlance for EMP.19 The EMP Commission Report warns, “China and Russia have considered limited nuclear attack options that, unlike their Cold War plans, employ EMP as the primary or sole means of attack.”20 America cannot afford to bet its security on the perpetual good will of Russia and China. Deterrence of an EMP attack on the United States by Russia or China only has to fail once for the American people to suffer catastrophic consequences.<br />

US-China relations key to solve Iran, North Korea prolif<br />

Outside of global economic issues, national security concerns are strongly tied to the health of the United States' relationship with China, which is adversely impacted by rising trade tensions. The two countries posing the greatest contemporary threats to the security of the United States are Iran and North Korea, 232 and China's cooperation in confronting these nations is of paramount importance. In August 2009, American officials carried a message concerning Iran to Chinese officials in Beijing: &quot;if Iran were to be kept from developing nuclear weapons, China would have to throw more diplomatic weight behind the cause.&quot; 233 Chinese ties with Iran have already worried members of the American government. 234 After China agreed with [*331] Iran on a series of billion dollar energy deals, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Howard L. Berman (D-CA28), called them &quot;'exactly the wrong message' to send to an Iran that seemed determined to flout international nuclear rules.&quot; 235 As one anonymous Chinese official stated, concerning China's non-cooperation with American sanctions against Iran, &quot;China is not anxious to jump on this American train.&quot; 236 This hesitancy is due to the difference between how the two countries each view the threat of a nuclear Iran. 237 America sees Iran as a major obstacle to energy agreements, as well as a threat to global stability and allies in the Middle East, most notably Israel. 238 China, meanwhile, is not directly threatened by Iran and may benefit if Iran forces America to commit even more military focus and energy to control the Middle East. 239 Chinese-Iranian economic and energy ties also continue to grow. China has committed $ 120 billion to Iranian energy projects, while Iran has been one of the biggest purchasers of heavy manufacturing equipment from China. 240 These growing political and economic ties have already caused China to prevent the United Nations from imposing even more serious sanctions against Iran. 241 As a permanent member of the Security Council, China has veto power over any proposal, 242 and so far has been hesitant to side with the United States in imposing stiff sanctions against Iran's nuclear program. 243 China has agreed to a few sanctions against Iran, but only after watering down the initial proposal and waiting for approval from Russia (Iran's other close ally on the Security Council). 244 The question becomes, if China is not eager to help America's quest to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons in the first place, what would happen with a souring U.S.-China relationship? The situation may be even more serious when one considers North Korea. China has been allied with North Korea since the Korean War in the early 1950s. 245 China has helped sustain Kim Jong-Il's regime since his ascendancy to power in 1994 by, among other things, opposing harsh international economic [*332] sanctions in the hope of keeping Kim Jong-Il in power. 246 China is also North Korea's biggest trading partner and its main source of food, military equipment, and fuel. 247 As North Korea's closest and most important ally, 248 China is in a unique position to curtail Jong-Il's nuclear ambitions. After North Korea tested nuclear weapons in October 2006 and May 2009, China began to rethink the nature of its relationship with North Korea. 249 After each nuclear test, China agreed to United Nations Security Council resolutions imposing tough sanctions aimed at inhibiting North Korea's nuclear program. 250 This does not mean, however, that China has completely severed ties with North Korea; in fact, quite the opposite is true. 251 Selig S. Harrison, Asia Program Director at the Center for International Policy, has said that the Chinese are &quot;'doing just what they have to do and no more' in terms of punishing North Korea.&quot; 252 China's diplomatic priorities already weigh against helping the United States control North Korea's nuclear ambitions. For China, having a friendly country to its northeast is more important than aiding this American effort. 253 North Korea creates a &quot;buffer zone between China and democratic South Korea,&quot; home to a large garrison of U.S. troops. 254 In addition, this allows China to divert a large amount of military strength to dealing with Taiwan and its independence movement. 255 China is also largely interested in appeasing North Korea and preventing war from breaking out on the Korean peninsula. 256 If North Korea provokes a war, which it is certainly capable of doing independently, China would likely experience much damage from military operations, in addition to an extremely large flood of North Korean refugees moving over the border. 257 China's leverage over North Korea is also vital to the United States' goals in the region. First, North Korea relies heavily on China for food, goods, and fuel. 258 Some estimate that China provides North Korea with ninety percent of its energy imports, eighty percent of its consumer goods, and forty-five [*333] percent of its food. 259 Because of this, China is in a unique position to bring North Korea to any negotiating tables. The Six-Party Talks are a series of negotiations designed to end North Korea's nuclear program and involve the United States, China, North and South Korea, Japan, and Russia. 260 China has already brought North Korea to the Six-Party Talks on multiple occasions, 261 and it is hard to imagine North Korea willingly cooperating without at least some prompting from China. Second, China has an ambiguous defense pact with North Korea. 262 Under the 1961 Sino-North Korean Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, China is compelled to intervene for the defense of North Korea against unprovoked aggression. 263 China, however, is allowed to make an &quot;authoritative interpretation of the principle for intervention.&quot; 264 The likelihood that China does in fact intervene may be tied to China's relationships with the rest of the world at the time, as &quot;China now places more value on national interest, over alliances blinded by ideology.&quot; 265 Consequently, China may choose to remain neutral during any conflict between North Korea and the United States to preserve diplomatic relations, or, if current U.S.-China ties are weak, China may emerge as a strong voice of dissent against western interference in Asian politics. 266 It is very possible that China-not the United States-holds the key to preventing both Iran and North Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons, and therefore, it is in America's best interest to ensure China's cooperation on all fronts.<br />

Space co-operation trades off with Chinese missile development<br />
Day, 2004, April, Dwayne A., The Space Review, DC based space policy analyst. “The benefits of a new space race,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1260:http://www.thespacereview.com/article/137/1 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/137/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/137/1</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1260 -->, KHaze<br />
<br />
Human spaceflight is enormously expensive, even in places where labor is cheap. Despite the slow and deliberate pace of the Chinese human spaceflight program so far, it is clear that China has spent a considerable amount of money to acquire this new capability—nearly $2 billion. In addition to developing a spacecraft and launching four previous unmanned missions, China has also built a new rocket, a new launch pad, and a large assembly building for integrating all of the equipment, as well as various other support facilities, such as a tracking station in Namibia and several tracking ships. Recovery forces such as helicopters and aircraft cost additional money. The only demonstrated payoff of human spaceflight is prestige. There is nothing that a human can do in low Earth orbit, other than the study of other humans, that a robot cannot do better. China may also demonstrate the value of spaceflight at diverting domestic attention from government oppression and corruption. But the Chinese government is going to do this anyway with other events, such as the 2008 Olympics. As for China’s industrial policy, the United States long ago learned that the spin-off argument is a weak one; although developing spacecraft does produce some useful technologies, it is generally inefficient. If you want a faster computer chip, then develop one; there is no need to go to the Moon to do so. Ultimately, the expensive Shenzhou program is not buying the Chinese much other than newspaper headlines. In the meantime, all of that money has to come from somewhere, and it is most likely coming out of their ballistic missile budget. The more money China spends on human spaceflight, the less money it has to spend on missiles pointed at the United States or Taiwan. In fact, the military aspects of the Shenzhou program demonstrate this point. The Chinese president wanted a human spacecraft for prestige purposes, but in order to get it he had to compromise with the military and allow it to be used for missions such as photoreconnaissance and signals intelligence. The military seems to have learned a lesson from the United States and Soviet Union, who discovered decades ago that humans have no military utility in space, so the taikonaut deploys the orbital module with its military payloads in orbit and then departs, leaving the other spacecraft to operate on its own. However, this is not only a bureaucratic compromise, but a mission compromise for the military as well. Due to requirements to bring the manned capsule back to China, Shenzhou does not fly in an orbit that swings very far north or south, so the amount of territory it can photograph or snoop electronically is limited. An ideal military spacecraft would also take advantage of all the extra mass and volume that is currently devoted to keeping the human passenger alive. Linking their military space program to their human space program is simply an expensive kludge that wastes money. It is in America’s interest to encourage such Chinese wastefulness and have them spend more money in non-military space operations. The last thing the United States wants is for China to close down its human space program and put that money back into armaments. So a logical move is for the United States to engage and encourage the Chinese in this new realm. The docking port on the Shenzhou spacecraft is perfectly suited to hooking up to the International Space Station if China is willing to launch the vehicle into a different orbit. President Bush could propose allowing China to visit the ISS in perhaps five years, after they have demonstrated a significant amount of flight experience. The genius of such a proposal is that it would require the Chinese to build new facilities, such as a tracking station to cover the ISS orbit, and work hard at gaining experience necessary for such a rendezvous. In addition, China would have to open up its program to Western experts to demonstrate its safety. From a Chinese perspective such a mission would have benefits as well. It would symbolize that China has achieved a certain level of parity with the other space powers and is being taken seriously. The United States could certainly live with this, if the result is to siphon money out of China’s missile and military space programs. There is an opportunity for a first step in a related area. China is planning on launching a robotic lunar spacecraft in 2006. The United States is also planning on launching a lunar spacecraft a few years later. So far there has been no effort by either nation to link these two projects. In fact, a Chinese scientist who wanted to travel to a conference in Hawaii to discuss their work was restricted from entry due to visa problems. But instead of ignoring or shunning the Chinese scientific effort, the U.S. could propose closer cooperation with the Chinese to share data from their mission in return for the United States doing the same. Once again, encouraging China to spend its money on non-military space serves American interests. In the past, many in Congress felt that allowing China to launch American commercial satellites resulted in China gaining access to important American technology. While some of these concerns were overblown, there is a legitimate American interest in not helping Chinese missile programs. But there is no reason that cooperation with China, carefully structured, would result in technology transfer. Furthermore, this is a subject that the U.S. has dealt with before. In the mid-1970s when America and the Soviet Union cooperated on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, a detailed review determined that there was no significant technology transfer from the United States to the USSR. Sharing lunar probe data, or asking China to fly a manned mission to the International Space Station, will not compromise any sensitive technology. Beyond these cooperative efforts, there may be an opportunity to spur healthy competition with China in human spaceflight. When President Bush unveiled his new space vision in January he was careful to note that this is a “journey, not a race” to the Moon and elsewhere. But it may actually be in America’s interest to encourage the Chinese to think they are in a race to the Moon—and to spend accordingly. So far most of China’s human spaceflight ambitions are focused on developing low earth orbit capabilities such as rendezvous. They achieved the Shenzhou feat through incremental advances in existing technology. But the next step, to a manned lunar flyby or orbit, is a much bigger leap than China has taken before. The Chinese will have to build a new large rocket in the Ariane 5 class, and the extensive ground infrastructure to support it and further manned spacecraft ambitions. All of this requires large amounts of money and will not be easy. If the United States can encourage China to spend this money on peaceful competition rather than sabers to rattle at Taiwan and Los Angeles, then a new space race could have positive results for world stability and American self-interest.<br />

Space communication solves tense relations<br />

Manber’s third point is a good one: communication between the U.S. and China is poor concerning strategic space issues. There is some evidence that the Chinese leadership was surprised at the world reaction to their January 2007 ASAT test. Creating ties in civil space cooperation will allow the two countries to engage each other better. American history is filled with examples where back channel communications proved vital during periods of strained relations (witness the Cuban Missile Crisis). It is to the United States’ benefit to have the phone numbers of a few people in the Chinese space establishment to call up the next time relations grow tense.<br />

Yet there is a strong view around the world and in American politics on all parts of the political spectrum that views a future Cold War between the United States and China as inevitable. The people who hold this view reason that China is in rapid economic and military ascendancy, the United States is in relative decline (i.e. inflation, the falling dollar, the slide toward recession, perpetual military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a deeply unpopular president), and sometime in the next few decades China and the United States will be bipolar rivals. They view the two countries as lines on a graph, with the U.S. heading down and China heading up. At some point they will cross and there will be Cold War. Some liberals naively welcome such a development, believing that it will place a check on what they view as American unilateralist, even imperialist, actions around the world. Some conservatives equally naively believe that the United States must start building up its arsenal right now and prepare for inevitable conflict. But of course, a Cold War between China and the United States is not inevitable, just as perpetual hostility between the United States and China beyond 1969 was not inevitable. Things can change, both as a result of powers beyond the control of governments, and as the results of the actions of leaders. There has been a lot of discussion in the United States about American decline. It has been the topic of many books such as Charles Kupchan’s The End of the American Era, Chalmers Johnson’s Nemesis: The Last Days of the American Republic, and the most well known, Cullen Murphy’s Are We Rome?: The Fall of an Empire and the Fate of America. But the American decline—assuming that it is real and not a temporary cyclical event—could still reverse, and it is important to consider that much of this discussion of decline is ideologically driven and exaggerated, either by people who wish it to happen, or those who want to avert it. Consider that the United States has experienced numerous periods where many people considered it in decline: the Sputnik crisis, the “multipolar reality” of the late 1960s, the Oil Crisis of 1973, Jimmy Carter’s malaise era, and Paul Kennedy’s “imperial overstretch” theory and fears of Japanese ascendancy in the 1980s. Some of these perceived declines were nonexistent (Sputnik), and others badly conceived (imperial overstretch), and others reversed when the “threat” fell apart (OPEC, Japan). And of course the Soviet Union fell apart, leaving the United States in the role of unrivaled world leader for nearly two decades, despite most theorists’ predictions. The Prophets of Doom have some explaining to do. Similarly, the Chinese ascendancy could also reverse. Severe structural weaknesses underlie China’s economic growth. Furthermore, many aspects of China’s political, economic, and military growth have been exaggerated. China’s foreign interests also are mostly confined to trading around the world and maintaining control of those territories that it considers traditionally Chinese, like Tibet and Taiwan. China has not demonstrated an interest in fomenting revolution around the world for decades. China has been modernizing its military, but it has not demonstrated an interest in substantially increasing its strategic capabilities, such as rapidly developing a blue water navy or changing its strategic nuclear posture. Taiwan can always flash up, but for the most part China has a greater commercial interest in the rest of the globe than it does an ideological interest, a situation that did not exist during the Cold War. Finally, the Chinese, unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War, have an interest in a healthy United States, which can purchase its products and borrow its money (at interest)—China does not want to bury the Americans, they want to buy the Americans, and that can only happen if the Americans are selling (or borrowing). But most importantly, it is possible for the two countries to deliberately avoid a hostile superpower rivalry by maneuvering themselves out of one. They could mutually agree that military confrontation on a strategic basis is simply unwise, and unprofitable. They could take steps to improve communications and relations. And space exploration could serve as one tool for navigating the two powers away from a future adversarial relationship.<br />

Chinese Vice President Xi[’s] Jinping's visit next week is an opportunity for the man who is likely to lead China from late 2012 to late 2022 to begin to develop the agenda for that decade with a president who may well serve until January 2017. Yet this visit comes at a time of growing strategic distrust between China and the United States. China, despite some problems, remains on a roll. Its economy has rapidly expanded to second largest in the world, with GDP continuing to advance in the high single digits. Its military budget has grown 10-plus percent annually for more than a decade, growth that is likely to continue for years. Meanwhile, U.S. economic confidence and outcomes remain afflicted by the 2008-09 financial crisis, and our military is wrestling with budget cuts as we address our fiscal deficit. The United States is far stronger and wealthier than China and will remain so for years. But the balance of resources and capabilities is shifting. And nowhere is that more acutely felt than in Asia, where visions of the future cast a long shadow over current perceptions around the region. As President Obama has stressed, Asia is the most vital region for sustained American prosperity. Beijing sees itself again becoming the central player in Asia and as strong enough to expect that Washington will no longer treat its core concerns with what it views as a bullying, dismissive attitude. China increasingly wants to control military activities in the waters off its coast. Dependent on imports for vital energy resources, China is pressing its territorial claims in potentially energy-rich maritime areas in the East and South China Seas.China, arguably the world's second most powerful country, is rankled by U.S. diplomacy that it sees as emboldening people in Taiwan, Tibet and the huge northwestern region of Xinjiang to defy Beijing. The United States has long been a Pacific power with formal alliances and strategic ties throughout the region. Tradition and vital interests come together in America's determination to protect its leadership role in Asia, backed up by extensive economic ties and a military that can operate freely in international waters there. Obama vowed during a trip to Asia last November to maintain America's leadership role and to protect defense capabilities there from budgetary pressures on overall military expenditures. While both Washington and Beijing consider good bilateral relations vital, the potential is clear for their growing strategic rivalry to evolve into mutual antagonism. With a U.S. presidential election and a major leadership succession in China happening in 2012, both sides are looking primarily to prevent a souring in relations this year. That is understandable, but insufficient. Neither country will be able to lessen strategic mistrust unless it addresses a central question: What array of military deployments and normal operations would permit China to defend its core security interests while allowing America to continue to fully meet its obligations to allies in the region? The answer will not be completely comfortable for either side: China's military is developing capabilities to force changes in U.S. platforms and plans, and Beijing cannot realistically hope to achieve the capacity to dominate the surrounding seas out to the first island chain against determined American efforts to prevent that domination. So far, each side is developing doctrines that are little understood by the other: China has adopted a strategy of being able to defend its interests in &quot;nearby seas,&quot; while the Pentagon has articulated a goal of maintaining the capability to overcome any &quot;anti-access/area denial.&quot; Threat perceptions on both sides are assuming a life of their own. The specifics and operational assumptions behind each doctrine are opaque, but each is increasingly couched in terms that can justify escalating military expenditures as both militaries attempt to achieve levels of certainty that are, so far, unattainable. This trend cries out for top political leaders to step in and, along with their militaries, discuss principles and accommodations that give each side reasonable certainty about its core security interests. They should try to reach a set of understandings that include steps embodying mutual restraint on development and deployments of particularly destabilizing weapons systems. To improve trust, such discussions need to probe each side's goals and expectations on such sensitive issues as the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan. Xi[‘s] Jinping's visit will not immediately produce major steps toward such mutual understanding. But it is not too early to begin addressing the core issue of mutually agreed overall security postures in Asia. The forces driving the trend toward escalation of tensions and costs, with the likely result of diminished real security for all, are in play. The topic will take years to work out. Efforts to bring this under greater control by both leaderships should begin next week.<br />

China can cooperate and will ask for inclusion<br />

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — A top Chinese government space official on April 14 appealed to the U.S. government to lift its decade-long ban on most forms of U.S.-Chinese space cooperation, saying both nations would benefit from closer government and commercial space interaction. He specifically called for cooperation on manned spaceflight, in which China has made massive investment in recent years. Lei Fanpei, vice president of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC), which oversees much of China’s launch vehicle and satellite manufacturing industry, said China purchased more than $1 billion in U.S.-built satellites in the 1990s before the de facto ban went into effect in 1999. Since then, the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) have made it impossible to export most satellite components, or full satellites, to China for launch on China’s now successful line of Long March rockets. The ITAR regulations that tightened the U.S. technology export regime were put into place to punish China for its missile exports, and to slow development of China’s rocket industry by reducing its customer base. Most commercial telecommunications satellites carry at least some U.S. parts, which is why ITAR has all but locked China out of the global commercial launch market. The U.S. government is reviewing the current ITAR regime, which U.S. industry says has had the unintended effect of making it difficult to sell satellites and satellite components just about anywhere in the world. At the same time, China’s domestic demand for launches of its own telecommunications, navigation, Earth observation and science satellites — and its manned space program — has given the Long March vehicle sufficient business to earn it a record of reliability. The global insurance underwriting community now ranks the Long March vehicle alongside Russian and European rockets for reliability when it sets insurance premiums. Addressing the National Space Symposium here, Lei said Chinese vehicles launched more than 20 U.S.-built satellites in the 1990s. While cooperation with the United States has been shut down, he said, China has maintained relations with the 18-nation European Space Agency, Brazil, France, Russia and others. China also has developed a telecommunications satellite product line that has been bundled with a Chinese Long March vehicle to offer in-orbit delivery of telecommunications spacecraft to a half-dozen nations that in many cases can offer China access to their crude oil reserves. Lei said he sees three areas in which U.S.-Chinese cooperation would be in both nations’ interests. The first, he said, is an open commercial access of each nation to the other’s capabilities in satellites and launch vehicles. The second, he said, is manned spaceflight and space science, particularly in deep space exploration. The third is in satellite applications including disaster monitoring and management.<br />

The timetable for the second decade includes more lunar probes, including one with landing and patrol equipment to collect rock samples, and probes to explore Mars and Venus (Song 2010; Richburg 2011). Beijing’s ambition is to send a taikonaut to Mars after the Moon mission, with projections that this 80-million-km journey could occur by 2030 (Huei 2011). China is not alone in the quest for landing humans on the Moon and Mars. The European Union, Russia, Japan and India are planning manned missions to one or both. As for the US, it has turned to the commercial sector for taking astronauts into space. The private company, SpaceX, plans to land an astronaut on Mars by 2030–the same timeframe as China. It is one of two space companies that have been awarded $75 million from NASA to assist in developing a replacement for the space shuttle, which ended three decades of service in 2011. Still, the Moon is more approachable than Mars. The US had landed the first man on the Moon in 1969; no one has landed on Mars. The survival record for probes to Mars is poor (only one-third) and the cost exorbitant. This suggests a multilateral mission is more likely, though a Chinese may yet be the first human to land on Mars. Meanwhile, in low Earth orbit, China is constructing a manned space station as a staging base for deep-space exploration. The PRC was not invited to join the International Space Station (ISS), so it decided to build its own. Given that the United States, through NASA, is the leading member of ISS, 3 China’s exclusion is not surprising. The US fears China’s application of dual-use space technology for nefarious purposes and even banned American companies from transferring satellite technology to China. By contrast, China says that in keeping with its policy of opening up to the outside world, its space station would welcome scientists from all countries (David 2011). Provisionally named Tiangong (“Heavenly Palace”), the space station will comprise a central module with two laboratory modules for experiments. A cargo spaceship is also being developed for regular re-supply missions. Chinese citizens were asked to participate in finding a permanent name for the new station and cargo ship, thereby involving them directly in the prestige of space endeavors. The space station’s construction began in 2011 and is expected to be complete by 2020, with problems being solved along the way. These included improving technology for cargo supply and for taikonauts to stay in orbit for mid-term missions of 20 days. These were identified as tasks to be completed by 2015, as part of China’s the 12 th five-year plan (Xinhua 2011b). China is also building its own global navigational satellite system, Beidou (“Compass”). Beidou has already begun serving China and neighboring countries. The second generation, Beidou-2, will consist of 35 satellites that will provide global services. In April 2011, when China launched its eighth satellite of the system, its officials pointed out that Beidou, unlike the American GPS, provides a text message service. As Beidou’s chief designer, Sun Jiadong, explained: “The main feature of Beidou is that it can deliver messages. In other words, if I pick up a cell phone and communicate with Beidou, it can give me my position” (Xinhua 2011c; for details of the Baidou system see Barbosa 2011). Like the US GPS and Russia GLONASS systems, Beidou also has a military function making it a typically dual-use space technology. In view of US exclusion of China from ISS and China developing its own space infrastructure for both deep-space and terrestrial projects, a new space race could be deemed to be underway. This time the strategic adversaries would be the United States and the PRC, with China as the rising superpower and the US as the declining one. However, Beijing has been careful to maintain the mantra of its peaceful intentions and the cooperative nature of its space activities. As stated in the PRC’s 2010 defense white paper: In accordance with the principle of peaceful use of outer space, China has conducted bilateral cooperation and exchanges with Russia, France, Brazil, Ukraine, the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA) in the fields of space technology, space exploration and space science. It supports the work of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) and Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO), and plays an active role in making use of outer space technologies to conduct multilateral cooperation in Earth science research, disaster prevention and reduction, deep space exploration, and space debris mitigation and protection (State Council Information Office 2011) Beijing believes that the best way to “prevent any weaponization of or arms race in outer space is to negotiate and conclude a relevant international legally-binding instrument” (ibid.). To this end, it has jointly submitted with Russia a draft Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects (for discussion, see Listner 2011). Indeed, Russia has been its closest collaborator in joint space projects, including the 2010-2012 China-Russia Space Cooperation Outline (Cheng 2009). Both countries have much to gain from countering any emergent hegemonic practices in space as the last frontier. They share an interest in fostering a multipolar world and opposing the US missile defense program. Moscow’s initial, if short-lived, cooperation goes back to the 1950s when in the role of communist ally it provided assistance to China’s rocket and satellite program. The SinoSoviet split of the early 1960s put an end to this, but China’s space program was not reliant wholly on Moscow. Expert leadership came through an American-trained Chinese, Qian Xuesen. He returned to China in 1955 after being suspected of being a spy for ‘Red China’. This was during the anti-communist hysteria of the McCarthy era in the United States. China had its own political witch-hunt in the 1960s under the Great Proletariat Cultural Revolution when intellectuals were persecuted for not belonging to the ideologically condoned class of workers and peasants. Though there were some delays caused by the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, China still managed to launch its first satellite, the Dong Fang Hong (DFH-1). It transmitted the revolutionary song of its namesake, ‘The East is Red’, for the 26 days in orbit. This made China the fifth nation with independent launch capability. Over the next four decades, China successfully launched well over 100 satellites for commercial, scientific and military use. In 2010 alone, it purportedly launched as many satellites as the United States: 15. Even so, China had only 67 satellites in orbit (civilian and military) compared to the USA’s known 441 in total and Russia’s 99 (Axe 2010). China’s “peaceful rise” to space has not displaced either of the former Cold War warriors. However both the American and Russian space programs have seen their heyday whereas China is still looking forward to its apogee. China’s expanding space activities and newer infrastructure is reflected in the construction of a fourth space launch centre in Wenchang in the southern island of Hainan. 4 Hainan’s proximity to the equator takes advantage of the effects of the Earth's rotation in increasing rocket thrust and thus the launch of heavier payloads. These are necessary for the new Chinese space station and deep space exploration. The Wenchang Satellite Launch Center was approved by State Council and the Central Military Commission in 2008, “for launching new-generation rocket-carriers and space vehicles like geosynchronous (GEO) satellites, polar-orbiting satellites, space stations and deep-space exploration satellites” (Xinhua 2009). As a country the size of China becomes even more developed, its reliance on space will increase. Space has become so intrinsic to China’s future in promoting its comprehensive national strength that cosmic diplomacy is set to become the “high politics” of the next generation. In this respect, China project manager for the US Union of Concerned Scientists, Gregory Kulacki, made a pertinent remark. Reflecting on opposition in the US to space cooperation with China, lest it acquires knowledge at the US’s expense, Kulacki said that China had experienced such a growth in capabilities that the incentive for space cooperation with the US may diminish. He pointedly added: “We need to get past the idea that the Chinese need us more than we need them” (in Foust 2011).<br />

Perception of US aggression undermines control over the PLA- the plan’s concession removes their ability to paint the US as aggressive<br />
Thompson, 1-17-11, Drew, director of China studies and Starr senior fellow at the Nixon Center. “Hu's Really in Control in China?” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1266:http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/17/hu_s_really_in_control_in_china --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/17/hu_s_really_in_control_in_china" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/17/hu_s_really_in_control_in_china</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1266 -->, KHaze<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Hu's upcoming visit to Washington this week will symbolize the cooperative nature of a bilateral relationship. Billions of dollars in two-way trade, investment, and planeloads full of students, tourists, business people, and officials flying between the two countries on a daily basis reminds us that we are clearly not facing a new Cold War with China. However, China's assertive tone and confrontational approach toward neighbors and the United States over the past year raises questions about China's intent. Shortly after the J-20 took its first test flight in front of spectators lining the periphery of the airfield, Gates reportedly asked Hu about the fighter plane, only to be met with blank stares and confusion from both civilian and military officials in the room. Immediately after the meeting, speculation ran rampant that Hu had been unaware of the test flight. Before jumping to conclusions, however, let's remember that China's national security decision-making process is opaque, and so this worrisome disconnect -- who knew what when -- is difficult to ascertain with certainty. It is highly improbable that Hu was unaware of the development of this major military advancement. His role as chairman of the Central Military Commission ensures that he is well briefed about major programs, and he doubtlessly approves their large budgets. What is not known is how much oversight and control the central government leadership in Beijing had over the PLA's decision-making process that lead to highly visible tests at the Chengdu air base just as Gates was visiting China. Similar questions have arisen in the past: On Jan. 11, 2007, China launched an anti-satellite weapon, destroying an aging Chinese satellite in low Earth orbit, but the Foreign Ministry did not publicly acknowledge the test for 12 days. In March 2009, according to the Pentagon, five Chinese civilian vessels &quot;aggressively maneuvered in dangerously close proximity&quot; to the USNS Impeccable, blocking its path and closing to within 25 feet while crew members tried to grapple electronic gear towed behind the U.S. ship. There are many more examples. In each instance, the question arose: Were these provocative confrontations ordered from the highest echelons in Beijing, or were they the result of overzealous local commanders or even the plane and boat drivers themselves? Do these incidents reflect an intentional pattern of growing Chinese assertiveness and a long-term strategy to ultimately confront the U.S. military? Or are these Chinese overreactions to U.S. technological dominance and what the Chinese perceive to be American provocations -- such as air and sea surveillance in international waters close to China's shores and the well-publicized deployments of the United States' most advanced submarines, ships, and jet fighters to bases in the western Pacific? No matter how you look at it, the possible explanations for the apparent civil-military disconnect revealed in the meeting between Hu and Gates are troubling. Whether Hu was snubbed by his own military, or whether he had indeed endorsed the stealth-fighter flight tests the same day he met with Gates to signal China's intent to challenge the United States -- both possibilities are equally disturbing for the bilateral relationship. If Hu's presumed successor, Vice President Xi Jinping, played a role -- even observing the tests at the Chengdu base as some amateur Chinese army enthusiasts have claimed -- then it might indicate a difficult transition of power between the two in the run-up to the 18th Community Party Congress in 2012. Should Hu and Xi become embroiled in a direct power struggle (in truth, an unlikely possibility), each would undoubtedly seek to garner support from &quot;patriotic&quot; conservatives at home by painting themselves as defenders of China from the American hegemon; but this would limit their ability to engage and compromise with the United States. Regardless, the pattern of China confronting the United States and its allies in Asia is increasingly well established. It stands in stark contrast to the close working relationship between U.S. and Chinese civilian officials and businesses, but it is increasingly apparent that there are two very different faces of modern China. Clearly, the Chinese government is eager for Hu's visit to the United States to be a success. It is an integral part of its succession process, a last &quot;face-giving&quot; trip to establish his role as a great world leader -- cementing his legacy and enabling him to retire to the pantheon populated by Mao, Deng, and Jiang. But the PLA's reluctance to engage the United States mocks the rest of the bilateral relationship. Gates's visit to Beijing was squeezed into the calendar ahead of Hu's visit to Washington, ostensibly to help ensure the success of Hu's state visit. Although the PLA carried out its orders and received Gates, the Chinese military's lack of enthusiasm was apparent in the lack of progress in restarting the relationship. Gates had invited various PLA generals to visit the United States and proposed establishing a &quot;2+2&quot; dialogue mechanism -- pairing civil and military counterparts at the same meeting -- replicating a model that has proved effective with Japan and South Korea. The PLA, unfortunately, received these proposals tepidly, only agreeing to consider them, rather than accepting them outright. In this complex environment, Hu's visit to Washington is an opportunity to reinforce the importance of dialogue and engagement, made all the more important following Gates's uncomfortable meetings in Beijing. But President Barack Obama should be cautious that, when it comes to Beijing, he may no longer be dealing with an executive in full control of all sectors of his government. Indeed, the Chinese have many ways -- and perhaps now many stakeholders who know how -- to say &quot;no&quot; without using the term.<br />

Plan resolves perceptions of US aggression in space- containment promotes fast-paced modernization while inaction causes China to see US vagueness as a signal for outracing us to defend themselves<br />

<br />
NEWPORT, USA: Over three millennia ago, the Chinese invented Wei Qi (pronounced way chee), a type of chess game with 361 pieces that allows for immense strategic complexity. Generations of Chinese leaders have studied the game in order to hone their decision-making skills. Today China views long-term geostrategic politics as having a similar number of possible permutations as a Wei Qi board, and Beijing is posturing accordingly. When Yang Liwei completed China's first manned space flight last October, China made a significant geostrategic Wei Qi move. The next move goes to the United States, and President Bush appears ready to make it. While a space race is not a foregone conclusion, it is a possibility. The United States is considering a new space initiative. Whether the Moon, Mars or something in-between or beyond, that's the what. Equally important is the how, as the devil is always in the details. In this geostrategic game of Chinese chess, the United States has three basic options. It can do nothing, which equates to sending congratulations and then continuing a status quo policy excluding China from cooperative space efforts. Alternatively, the US can explicitly commence with a new manned space race reminiscent of the US-Soviet competition during the Cold War. Or, the US can initiate an incremental program of cooperation between China, the US, and other international space partners. In deciding between these options, it is important to remember that while Wei Qi involves two players, here other players are simultaneously involved. This complication both influences maneuvering alternatives and increases the significance of the Washington's next move on the larger geostrategic gameboard. All things considered, cooperation is the best long-term choice for the United States. Doing nothing is likely not a viable long-term option. Though the US public was initially apathetic about Yang Liwei's flight, that could change. As the Chinese continue their ambitious manned space plans while the US Shuttle is grounded, the US will likely be perceived as having been overtaken by the Chinese in manned space activity. Chinese technology will not really have outpaced US technology, but Beijing's sustained political commitment will have. Additionally, while the US ignores China, the Chinese are seeking out and increasingly finding other countries favorably disposed toward working with them. The Chinese are already participating in the European Galileo navigation satellite program that could challenge the Global Positioning System developed and still completely controlled by the US. In sum, public perception-cum-prestige considerations and “control” issues make maintaining the status quo unacceptable. Alternatively, the United States can declare a space race, unilaterally announcing a long-awaited manned program to return to the Moon and/or a manned Mars mission. However, the International Space Station (ISS) partners, especially Russia and Europe, are unlikely to support a program developed without their input or one that excludes the Chinese. Further, the continuing financial and technical problems with the still-incomplete ISS make it unlikely that they would be anxious to commit, even if invited, to an expanded manned program. So if the US were to start another space race, it would likely be going it alone. Domestically, a competitive approach would accrue benefits to the US like those enjoyed during the Apollo program, including prestige, technology development, and jobs. Strategically, at the risk of otherwise losing face and allowing the technology gap to grow, China would be pushed toward increased spending on its manned program and at a faster pace than they would otherwise choose. That would divert funds from Chinese military programs and potentially cause China substantial economic hardship, similar to what happened when the Soviet Union felt compelled to spend money countering Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) technology. But there are three critical uncertainties that would make initiating a space race an unwise move - whether the US can afford an independent program and maintain the requisite political will to fund it through completion; whether it is really the best long-term strategy for long-term US-China relations; and whether the US can afford to reinforce further the view that it prefers unilateralism to multilateralism - in any realm of international relations. It can be argued the United States does not really need to stay the course and bring a new space race to a conclusion, as the unfinished SDI program still significantly impacted the Soviet Union. But to start with anything less than a full commitment sets a new program up for failure. US history is replete with space visions and programs set forth from podiums and later forgotten. Although wrapping a manned space program within a larger strategic vision is important and useful, political competition has far more short-term motivational impetus then long-term staying power. Additionally, Americans' desire and ability to carry the economic burden alone must be considered. Public support for paying the entire bill for a new manned space program is doubtful. Manned space exploration has been consistently viewed by the public as a good thing to do, but low on its list of funding priorities. Equally important is whether a competitive race with China is in the best interests of the United States. While spending the Soviets into bankruptcy unquestionably played a role in the eventual fall of communism in the Soviet Union, dealing with Russia as a near failed state in the subsequent years is not a model to deliberately set up in China. The third alternative focuses on cooperation. The US has a long and successful tradition of international cooperation in space. Especially in the areas of space science and environmental monitoring, the US has historically viewed space as an opportunity to build bridges with countries while simultaneously co-opting them into working on areas of our choice, rather than areas not to our liking. Cooperation is clearly the better option with China, too. The US could start slowly, rewarding Beijing for reciprocity and transparency by granting China an increasingly larger role in a joint program of manned exploration and development. Specifically, a US proposal to multilaterally review and expand the future of manned space exploration - from the ISS to another lunar voyage or even a Mars mission - on an incremental, inclusive basis would allow Washington to revitalize American space leadership. Crucially, it would also give the US a means to influence the future direction of the Chinese space program. This option would counter the prevailing view of the US as a unilateralist hegemon and allow for a focus on infrastructure development that does not require unrealistic budget burdens. While there is the risk of international politics intruding into the process over time, that is counterbalanced by the vested interest such a program would give participants in system stability. To be sure, there would be resistance to working with China. Washington is replete with individuals adamantly objecting to cooperation with China on grounds from human rights to its status as the largest remaining communist country. Isolating China, however, is increasingly a stance counterproductive to US interests, as a world without China is simply not possible. US and Chinese interests frequently overlap, on North Korea and the Global War on Terror, for example, not to mention economics. The United States has a window of opportunity to step in and use space cooperation to its advantage. Because space is considered so critical to the futures of both the US and China, any activity by one has been considered zero-sum by the other, triggering an action-reaction cycle and threatening escalation into an arms race of technology and countermeasure development. That direction can be changed. A inclusive vision will give the US an opportunity to assume the mantle of leadership on a mission that could inspire the world and shift Chinese activities into areas more compatible with US interests. On the geostrategic Wei Qi board, cooperation is the best &quot;next move&quot; for the US.<br />

 Butt’s calculations are biased and inaccurate<br />
Radasky, 2010, July, Dr. William Radasky served on the EMP Commission staff and was awarded the Lord Kelvin Medal by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) for his contributions to developing standards for the protection of electronic equipment from high power electromagnetic threats, including HEMP. He is also an EMP Fellow, an IEEE Fellow, and has published over 400 reports, papers and articles dealing with high power EM transients. Dr. Peter Vincent Pry served on the staffs of the EMP Commission, the House Armed Services Committee, the Central Intelligence Agency, and currently is Director of the United States Nuclear Strategy Forum and President of EMPact America. “Rebuttal to “The EMP threat: fact, fiction, and response,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1268:http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1656/1 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1656/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1656/1</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1268 -->, KHaze<br />

Dr. Butt’s calculations are deliberately biased to limit the EMP effects by first selecting a threat yield of 1-kiloton, and then claiming effects “only” in one state. He argues that terrorists or rogue states using a 1-kiloton weapon would want to optimize the EMP field strength by detonating at the lowest possible altitude, trading a gain in increased EMP field strength for a greatly reduced area of effect, limited to a radius on the ground of 725 kilometers. Dr. Butt: …the “sweet spot” for maximizing the EMP lethality of such weapons would be a detonation altitude of about 40 kilometers--significantly higher, or lower, and the peak fields at ground level will decrease....For 40 kilometers altitude, the maximum extent of the induced EMP E1-fields is within a 725-kilometer radius. However, contrary to Dr. Butt, terrorists or rogue states may prefer to trade reduced EMP field strength for a gain in area coverage, detonating their low-yield nuclear weapon at a higher altitude, covering the eastern part of the United States with an EMP field. Dr. Butt is mistaken that only the maximum region of the E1 HEMP field is important. That is completely wrong, as the peak electric field is not the only important parameter for coupling to cables and equipment. Extensive research has found that more horizontal angles of incidence of the E1 HEMP are much more efficient in coupling to lines, despite their lower field strengths. The many errors in Dr. Butt’s understanding of HEMP phenomenology appear to result from a lack of familiarity with some of the most basic texts on EMP, such as E.F. Vance’s Coupling to Shielded Cables and MIL-STD-188-125, which provides a method of hardening and testing ground-based C4I facilities to HEMP. The MIL-STD-464 cited by Dr. Butt as a source is recognized among specialists as having little value for EMP aspects.<br />

China gets high-tech space device The U.S. government recently sold the Chinese a highly sophisticated imaging device used on space telescopes that can be used by China's military for high-tech spying, according to a report in a Chinese newspaper. The STA1600 high-resolution space telescope could be used by the Chinese military to track and lock onto enemy satellites and missiles, according to military analysts. The sale of the equipment was disclosed in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post Jan. 3 and came as a surprise to many, including the Chinese themselves. Liu Qiang, a Chinese government researcher, told the newspaper that “the U.S. government’s attitude [on this sale] is very uncertain, so when the shipment arrived in a box of equipment, we were very pleased.” Resolution for high-end civilian imaging devices, such as digital cameras, is no more than 12 megapixels. The STA1600 imaging instrument obtained by the Chinese boasts 100 megapixels and was designed specifically for the U.S. Navy. The Obama administration has been reforming U.S. export controls and seeking to loosen them on certain dual-use civilian-military products while saying it wants to tighten controls on exports of the most sensitive dual-use products. China’s space program has taken big steps recently in the nation’s relentless quest for dominance in outer space. But one of the few areas where China lags behind the U.S. is in its inability to manufacture imaging devices that have the highest resolution. Exports of dual-use materials and products are subject to strict U.S. government restrictions. Such devices naturally fall into that category. In the end, trade and election-year politics seem to have trumped national security concerns on the imaging gear. The Commerce and State departments jointly issued an export license to a California manufacturer, Semiconductor Technology Associates, that allowed the sale of the imaging device to China. Because China’s space program is run by the military, it appears almost certain that the device will be used by the Chinese military, which is increasing its space-intelligence capabilities.<br />

Third, why is this rule so awful? Well, if Obama’s folks followed it, not only would it mean yet another embarrassing bilateral misstep, but it’s extremely shortsighted. The impetus for this is a fear that bilateral exchanges with OSTP and NASA will lead to dangerous, unintended technology transfer to China. This is rather condescending to the professionals at NASA and OSTP, who have decades of experience in how to handle sensitive technology when it comes to foreign governments and are perfectly aware of intellectual property infringement, government-backed espionage, and other dangers. These guys are the experts; they know more than Frank Wolf about technology transfer and how to compartmentalize information. I also wonder if Wolf realizes that if current trends continue, perhaps 50 years from now, it might be the U.S. that is desperate to open up these sorts of channels with China, which is spending a lot more on R&amp;D and is moving forward rapidly with its own space program. You’d think that this week’s events, which included an orbital docking between the Shenzhou spacecraft and the Tiangong lab module, would be a wake-up call to U.S. lawmakers, but apparently they are busy with other priorities.<br />

Counter interp- increase means removing a legal barrier to an increase<br />
Ripple, 87 (Circuit Judge, Emmlee K. Cameron, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. Frances Slocum Bank &amp; Trust Company, State Automobile Insurance Association, and Glassley Agency of Whitley, Indiana, Defendants-Appellees, 824 F.2d 570; 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 9816, 9/24, lexis)<br />
<br />
Also related to the waiver issue is appellees' defense relying on a provision of the insurance policy that suspends coverage where the risk is increased by any means within the knowledge or control of the insured. However, the term &quot;increase&quot; connotes change. To show change, appellees would have been required to present evidence of the condition of the building at the time the policy was issued. See 5 J. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 2941 at 4-5 (1970). Because no such evidence was presented, this court cannot determine, on this record, whether the risk has, in fact, been increased. Indeed, the answer to this question may depend on Mr. Glassley's knowledge of the condition of the building at the time the policy was issued, see 17 J. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 9602 at 515-16 (1981), since the fundamental issue is whether the appellees contemplated insuring the risk which incurred the loss.<br />

Predictability outweighs their impact- key to education and fair ground<br />
Bradley Shannon, 2002, law at University of Idaho, January (Washington Law Review, 77 Wash. L. Rev. 65)<br />
<br />
The first answer to this question is, why should we not care? If proper terminology (of whatever type) is readily available and comprehendible, why should one not want to use it? Does one really need a reason for not misusing any word, technical or otherwise? In other words, though many misuses of Rules terminology might not seem to cause serious problems, surely that is not an argument in favor of a disregard of proper Rules terminology, particularly where the cost of using proper terminology is negligible. 79 The second answer to the question why we should care about the use of proper Rules terminology goes to the cost of using improper terminology even in seemingly trivial contexts. Understanding legal concepts is difficult enough without the confusion created when an inappropriate term is used to represent those concepts. And this is true regardless of how minor the misuse. In some sense, every misuse of legal language impedes the understanding - and, consequently, the progress - of the law.<br />

The political situation in the United States, unfortunately, suggests that there may be significant obstacles to implementing a more extensive bilateral cooperative approach. In particular, there was little optimism among attendees to the various workshops that ITAR would be changed anytime soon—although there was broad agreement that the ITAR system needed significant overhauling and revamping. Similarly, longstanding restrictions on technology transfer to the PRC (for reasons of not only national security but also intellectual property rights and questions of competitiveness), as well as concerns about human rights and other aspects of the Chinese situation suggest that there would be significant political opposition to any effort to radically upgrade Sino-US bilateral cooperation in space. It remains to be seen how the incoming Obama administration might deal with these concerns. While the US has not engaged the PRC in negotiations over cooperating in space, it has engaged in a variety of other cooperative efforts, both commercial and political. From these past instances, it is clear that, should there be an effort to expand cooperation in space, there are certain essential preconditions that need to be met, if one is to be successful when working with the PRC.<br />

There is no question that, in today's Russia, official anti-Americanism serves a useful domestic purpose. It seeks to discredit not just a few Russian liberals but the much more numerous anti-government protesters by portraying them as America's fifth column. There is no doubt either that the view of the United States as Russia's adversary reflects the legacy of the Cold War and, perhaps even more than that, the disappointment that followed the end of the 40-year confrontation, when Russia, having withdrawn its forces from a score of countries and slashed its military equipment purchases by 68 times in just one year (1992), turned itself into an international supplicant, living from one International Monetary Fund tranche to another. But there is also the fact that, at the beginning of each post-Soviet Russian presidency, the Kremlin leader reached out to his counterpart at the White House in an effort to strike an alliance with the United States, only to be brushed off. Boris Yeltsin, in 1992, sought a formal alliance with Washington, only to be told, by George H.W. Bush, that with the Cold War over there was no need for new alliances anymore. When, however, the existing alliance, NATO, started to expand eastward, under Bill Clinton, Russia was only told not to worry. Rhetorically, the door was left open for Russia, but in reality Moscow's accession [to NATO] was never seriously considered. No wonder that Yeltsin's parting message to Clinton, in late 1999, was &quot;never to forget, not for a minute,&quot; that Russia was still a nuclear superpower. It is little mentioned these days that when Putin became president in 2000, he was determined to do what had eluded Yeltsin. Privately but very directly, he aspired to Russia's membership in NATO -- not to destroy it from the inside, as many readily suspected, but to cement the relationship with the United States, whose primacy Putin then was prepared to implicitly recognize. In the crucial first stage of the Afghanistan operation, Russia de facto became an ally of the United States. In an effort to build a strong security relationship with Washington, Putin chose not to respond to George W. Bush's unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that Moscow had always regarded as a bedrock of strategic stability, and he tolerated a U.S. military presence in the former Soviet Central Asia and Georgia. From mid-2002, however, the Bush White House became focused on Iraq, and Russia was left lying by the wayside. Putin gave vent to his pent-up frustration five years later in his famous Munich speech in which he denounced the United States, whose power refused to &quot;recognize any borders in this world.&quot; As he was picking up the pieces from the 2008 Georgia war, President Dmitry Medvedev, still overseen by Putin (now the prime minister), was positive, but initially cautious, in his response to Barack Obama's reset of the U.S. policy toward Russia. By the fall of 2009, however, he became very engaged, and by the time of the NATO-Russia summit in Lisbon a year later, Medvedev was positively enthusiastic about the U.S. relationship. The New START treaty was not enough. Medvedev started talking about missile defense cooperation in Europe as a means of placing the entire Euro-Atlantic area within a common security and defense perimeter. The Russian president's enthusiasm was short-lived. Following the failure in May 2011 to reach even a basic agreement on principles of cooperation, he issued a statement last November warning darkly about Russia's countermeasures against future U.S. missile defense deployments in Europe. True, each Russian attempt at engaging the United States has been awkward in its own way. In 1992, there was no common enemy around which to justify forming a U.S.-Russia alliance. Deng Xiaoping's China, busy with its four modernizations, did not replace the Soviet Union as a global challenger to the United States. In 2001, had Russia been admitted to NATO, the alliance would have turned into something like the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. A few years later, the United States and Russia narrowly escaped a head-on collision in the Georgia war. In 2011, a joint missile defense in Europe would have either de facto placed Russian assets under U.S./NATO authority or, more likely, made the system totally dysfunctional. But the issue here is not how the United States responded to specific Russian ideas, but rather that Washington wasn't really interested in engaging Moscow strategically at all. The reset, as the name itself suggests, is essentially a means to do away with policy glitches; it does not equal a policy, much less a long-term strategy. The U.S. rationale for having the reset in the first place had little or nothing to do with Russia. Instead, it allowed the United States to acquire Russia's logistical cooperation on the transit routes leading to Afghanistan, revive a modicum of nuclear arms control, and finalize Russia's 18-year quest to join the World Trade Organization. Beyond these relatively low-hanging fruits there was a void. Putin's formal return to the Kremlin is just days away. And with his tough campaign rhetoric and military modernization plans, on the one hand, and, on the other, the continuing protests in Russia against the existing political system, which challenge Putin's own legitimacy, the environment is even less propitious for an effort to improve strategic relations between Washington and Moscow. The more interesting issue is that, in the current U.S. foreign-policy debate, Russia has become a marginal quantity. A discussion of U.S. policy toward China can go on for hours without ever mentioning Russia; the Sturm und Drang over Iran's nuclear weapons program barely takes account of how U.S. moves might be perceived in Moscow; and though they loudly decry it with reference to Syria, hardly anyone in Washington loses sleep over the long-term implications of the ever-closer Sino-Russian alignment at the U.N. Security Council. The view of Russia as a power in permanent and unstoppable decline may be right, or it may not. If anything, Moscow should be even more interested in finding realistic ways to improve its relations with Washington. Russia's modernization agenda risks being scuttled in the event of a serious deterioration of its relations with the United States. What is striking, however, is that Washington, while focused intently on particular global issues -- from promoting the fledgling democracies of the Arab Spring to handing off Afghanistan to pivoting toward Asia -- thinks it can afford having no general strategic vision of relations with a country that, despite all its weaknesses and failings, can make a huge difference in the emerging global balance. Conventional wisdom in Washington declares that if there is no problem, there is no policy. This may have been just fine in the years of clear U.S. dominance in the world. It is hardly affordable now.<br />

Obama won’t push policies- Congressional deadlock benefits his re-election<br />

<br />
Starting with a fall campaign kickoff at an election rally with union workers in Detroit and a speech to Congress in which Obama demanded another round of stimulus spending, Obama spent the most of the fall and all of the winter so far dedicated to the proposition of proving to voters that he is brimming with solutions and energy while Congress are a bunch of partisan hacks and layabouts. While Bill Clinton used the similar moment of his 1996 State of the Union speech to capitalize on his post-midterm move to the middle and reaffirm his New Democrat roots – “the era of big government is over” – Obama is primarily interested in showing that he is an ideas guy and a large-scale reformer just brimming with solutions but that iniquitous Republicans and “this town” are keeping them all bottled up. Even Democrats seem hopelessly divided over basic issues like the Afghan war, tax rates, the need for more stimulus spending, etc., so this is, of course, a lot of hot air. But Congress is the most important prop for Obama in his re-election bid. As Vice President Joe Biden tells Democratic donors so often when he’s out picking up their checks: “Don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative.” The big advantage for Obama in divided government is that the quality of his ideas matter far less than in the first two years when his plans could be enacted. Recall the months of agony over crafting the first Obama stimulus, health law, bank regulations, global warming fees and other big-ticket items. Obama often found himself unable to corral his own party in Congress and the big ideas he had talked about as a candidate or in his first address to Congress in February 2009 ended up being political and policy disappointments. While Clinton used a divided government to enact welfare legislation that a Democratically controlled Washington would never have accepted, Obama has used divided government as a means by which to excuse a very long re-election campaign. Having spent much of his 12 years in public office prior to the presidency as a member of the minority party, first in Springfield and then in Washington, Obama is adept at political jujitsu. You obstruct me, I blame you for inaction. I obstruct you, I blame you for reckless partisanship. But since nothing happens except for a lot of palaver, the scorekeeping is all on making political points and messaging, areas at which Obama has excelled throughout his career. In this environment, policies are unimportant. What matters is the next election: “I would fix things if it weren’t for those guys.” This is the preferred position of both parties in Washington today. There is a good bit of truth to this since we have the most liberal president in 43 years and the most conservative House in more than 80 years. The number of places they might have agreed were very few, but in this case, the president seemed rather relieved to be able to give up trying. Even glimmers of hope on entitlement reform were quickly doused. The preferred narrative for the president’s re-election effort is that Obama came to office as an idealistic, post-partisan healer with a bold agenda to save the nation but that he underestimated the awfulness of Republicans, the dysfunction of Washington and the perfidy of some members of his own party. As a result he had to accept sub-par policy and engage in a great deal of hackery of his own. In this telling, Obama’s only real mistake was believing just a little too gosh-darned much in basic decency of people and the goodness of America. Tonight’s speech will be in service of that narrative. We will get to see the full unveiling of the Obama 2.0 he and his advisers have been offering sneak peeks of for weeks: tougher, wiser, disappointed but now ready to change Washington. There is little in his career that suggests Obama is much of a policy wonk, and even under the most favorable political circumstances he was unable to affect substantial reform in Washington. But tonight, you will get to meet Obama the battle-hardened, wonkish reformer. You will get to know him very well in the next 41 weeks.<br />

Commercial crew funding fights means the budget won’t happen till after November<br />

Although the rhetoric about commercial crew got heated early this year, it’s unlikely that in an election year the funding for the program, or NASA in general, will be quickly resolved. In brief comments at the CSF forum Thursday, Rep. Chaka Fattah (D-PA), ranking member of the House appropriations subcommittee whose jurisdiction includes NASA, said he expected that a final FY2013 appropriations bill won’t be completed after the November elections. At that time, he said, “it will be an opportunity for the country to think clearly about when it is that we want to have the capacity, an American capacity,” to send astronauts to the ISS. “The quickest way for us to get there is through commercial crew, and the worst way to proceed along that line is by undercutting the funding.” Fattah said that commercial crew “is a high priority for me, and a high priority for the administration.” However, he admitted that it will be “a challenging environment, given the overall fiscal circumstances relative to NASA” to secure full funding for the program. A lot may be riding on just how challenging that environment turns out to be for NASA, commercial crew companies, and their advocates.<br />

 China war is existential<br />
Wittner 11 (11/30/11 Dr. Lawrence, Prof of History Emeritus at SUNY Albany, “Is a Nuclear War with China Possible?”)<br />
<br />
But what would that &quot;victory&quot; entail? An attack with these Chinese nuclear weapons would immediately slaughter at least 10 million Americans in a great storm of blast and fire, while leaving many more dying horribly of sickness and radiation poisoning. The Chinese death toll in a nuclear war would be far higher. Both nations would be reduced to smoldering, radioactive wastelands. Also, radioactive debris sent aloft by the nuclear explosions would blot out the sun and bring on a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; around the globe -- destroying agriculture, creating worldwide famine, and generating chaos and destruction. Moreover, in another decade the extent of this catastrophe would be far worse. The Chinese government is currently expanding its nuclear arsenal, and by the year 2020 it is expected to more than double its number of nuclear weapons that can hit the United States. The U.S. government, in turn, has plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars &quot;modernizing&quot; its nuclear weapons and nuclear production facilities over the next decade.<br />

Economy resilient<br />

<br />
Wall Street economist David Malpass thinks that kind of fearmongering is filled with manipulated statistics that ignore long-term wealth creation in our country, as well as globally. Increasingly, people are investing &quot;for the long run - for capital gains (not counted in savings) rather than current income - in preparation for retirement,&quot; he told his clients last week. Instead of a coming recession, &quot;we think the U.S. is in gradual recovery after a sharp two-quarter slowdown, with consumer resilience more likely than the decades-old expectation of a consumer slump,&quot; Mr. Malpass said. &quot;Fed data shows clearly that household savings of all types - liquid, financial and tangible - are still close to the record levels set in September. IMF data shows U.S. households holding more net financial savings than the rest of the world combined. Consumption has repeatedly outperformed expectations in recent quarters and year,&quot; he said. The American economy has been pounded by a lot of factors, including the housing collapse (a needed correction to bring home prices down to earth), the mortgage scandal and the meteoric rise in oil and gas prices. But this $14 trillion economy, though slowing down, continues to grow by about 1 percent on an annualized basis, confounding the pessimists who said we were plunging into a recession, defined by negative growth over two quarters. That has not happened - yet. Call me a cockeyed optimist, but I do not think we are heading into a recession. On the contrary, I'm more bullish than ever on our economy's long-term prospects.<br />

Compared with much-hyped China, Russia's problems are well known. Its population is declining, and its health-care system is a disaster -- indeed the U.N. demographics division projects Russia's 15-59 age population to fall by one-fifth in the next three decades. With that projected labor-force decline, for Russia to sustain 5 percent annual economic growth would require that productivity per worker increase by almost 6 percent per year -- as opposed to the 2007 level of productivity growth, which was 1 percent. Russia's other drivers of growth also show considerable weakness. First, it is not a diversified economy. Although it is a leader in global arms exports and is making progress in software, its other products are not internationally competitive. Fully 25 percent of Russia's GDP comes from oil and gas revenues. The slowdown in global oil and gas consumption in 2008 and 2009 had a disastrous impact on the Russian economy, and worse consequences were only averted by Russia's wise provision of a stabilization fund accumulated between 2004 and 2007. Even Russia's oil output has been stagnant in recent years. Perhaps most worrisomely, Russia's dominant position in the European market for natural gas is now projected to have competition from large domestic reserves of shale gas found in Western Europe. Russia already has a well-educated labor force; improvements in productivity will have to come mainly from new technology and effective capital investments. Both, however, are lacking in Russia today. The IBM report on use of business technologies placed Russia as 59th out of 70 countries in e-business development, and 98th out of 134 countries in the use of the latest technologies by its companies -- again, like China, well below India and Brazil. Moreover, the lack of legal protections and a transparent justice system is an impediment to increased productivity down the line. Attracting foreign capital, and the efforts of domestic innovators and entrepreneurs, will require that investors be able to control their corporations and their profits, and operate under a state-enforced rule of law. Russia, however, is drifting toward a condition of endemic corruption and state predation. The recent trial and resentencing of former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky will likely reinforce the belief that Russia is not a nation of laws. This development is fatal for generating innovative entrepreneurship. Russia's government and economy will likely be kept afloat as long as oil and gas prices remain high. Yet that merely will turn Russia into Saudi Arabia with snow, not a center for future economic growth.<br />

Attached conditions to repeal ensure it doesn’t solve<br />
RIA Novosti, 4-12-12, “Russia Slams Attempts to Link Jackson-Vanik with Magnitsky Case,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1281:http://en.ria.ru/world/20120412/172768726.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.ria.ru/world/20120412/172768726.html" rel="nofollow">http://en.ria.ru/world/20120412/172768726.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1281 -->, KHaze<br />
<br />
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov strongly rejected on Thursday attempts by some U.S. lawmakers to link the repeal of the Soviet-era Jackson-Vanik amendment hampering Russian-U.S. trade with the adoption of new “anti-Russian laws” related to the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. “Attempts to replace an anti-Soviet amendment with anti-Russian laws are categorically unacceptable for us,” Lavrov said. The Magnitsky case is Russia’s domestic affair which is being dealt with at the highest level, he said, and “before the court makes a decision in this case, we should not interfere.” The U.S. authorities know Russia’s position on the issue “very well,” he added. A group of influential U.S. senators, including former Republican presidential candidate John McCain, proposed in mid-March introducing a blacklist of Russian officials allegedly linked to Hermitage Capital lawyer Magnitsky’s death in a Moscow pre-trial detention center in November 2009 in exchange for the cancellation of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. The amendment, passed in 1974, barred favorable trade relations with the Soviet Union because it wouldn’t let Jewish citizens emigrate. It has been defunct for the past two decades, and both the Kremlin and the Obama administration have warned that if not repealed, it would be an obstacle to productive U.S.-Russian trade relations when Russia enters the World Trade Organization (WTO). Magnitsky was arrested on tax evasion charges in November 2008, just days after accusing police investigators in a $230 million tax refund fraud, and died after almost a year in the Matrosskaya Tishina pre-trial detention center in Moscow. On Monday, Russian prosecutors said they had closed a criminal case on negligence charges against Larisa Litvinova, a doctor at the pre-trial detention facility where Magnitsky died, citing that the charges brought against her have been decriminalized. Hermitage Capital said Litvinova’s case was closed because the statute of limitations had expired. Another prison doctor, Dmitry Kratov, is the only official still facing charges over Magnitsky's death. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland criticized on Wednesday Russia’s investigation into the case as “inadequate.” The U.S. senators’ initiative stipulates U.S. entry bans and asset freeze for some 60 Russian officials allegedly linked to the Magnitsky case. Last year, the U.S. State Department admitted to imposing travel bans on several Russian officials in connection with the case, a move that triggered an angry diplomatic reaction from Moscow. The Cable foreign policy blog quoted U.S. envoy to Russia Michael McFaul as saying last month that the White House opposed linking the Jackson-Vanik amendment with any other legislation on human rights in Russia.<br />

Moscow has long opposed U.S. plans to deploy missile defense units in eastern Europe and has accused Washington of targeting Russia. Biden admitted Washington still could not provide Moscow with legally binding guarantees on the AMD, adding it would be very difficult to pass the judicial guarantees in the U.S. Congress. Biden's remarks implied the AMD has remained a stumbling block in U.S.-Russia and NATO-Russia relations, with both sides remaining suspicious of each other. Moreover, after the new START, the United States has been persuading Russia to negotiate on the reduction of tactical nuclear weapons. Russia has an absolute advantage in tactical nuclear weapons against NATO and believes its tactical nuclear weapons could overwhelm the advantages of NATO's conventional weapons. Dating back to the early 1990s, Russia and the United States have discussed the mutual reduction of tactical nuclear weaponry, but a premise set by Russia for the talks was that the United States should withdraw all its nuclear weapons from European countries. Zolotaryov said Gates had told Russia the strategic and tactical nuclear missiles of both countries must be reduced further, but Russian leader Medvedev reiterated the position he took in Lisbon last November. &quot;This demonstrated the parties did not hear each other,&quot; Zolotaryov said. &quot;Political declarations are the things which are easy come, easy go. This is why Moscow wants something firmer and more binding, like creation of a center for missile data exchange,&quot; Zolotaryov said. Gates's visit was overshadowed by the recent events in North Africa and issues about Libya were inevitably raised when meeting with Russian officials. Analysts said it was unfortunate for Gates that Western air attacks against Libya preceded his visit, irritating his Moscow hosts. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Monday criticized the role of the United States in the action against Libya, saying the use of force against other countries had become a steady trend in U.S. policy and this trend was &quot;disturbing.&quot;<br />

Obama as the embattled incumbent can defy the odds of history that suggest high unemployment and low job approval predict defeat, his advisers believe. How? Team Obama said the president can pull it off by selling a compelling vision for the future; touting past policy achievements and experience to key constituencies (Axelrod mentioned the health reform law as a net plus among Hispanic voters); using the bully pulpit to engrave the president’s jobs and the economic message with the public; and sparring with an unpopular Congress (and during the primaries with the GOP challengers) to draw sharp contrasts and show some fight. The president, they said, will stick with themes of protecting middle-class values, as outlined during his speech last week in Kansas. “This is what we’re going to be hammering throughout this campaign,” Axelrod added. “It’s a very distinct vision from what the Republicans offered.” Despite recent polls that indicate the president is trailing in some swing states, Axelrod continued, “all the data and all the research I see suggests there’s a solid core for the president, and there is a significant group of voters who are up for grabs -- and those voters don’t have a very positive view of the Republican Party.”<br />

Public support for overall space funding has hovered around 80 percent in favor of the status quo since 1965, except for a major dip in support during the early 1970s. That may bode well for NASA's continued existence, but it also suggests that few people are clamoring to throw even more money at the space agency. Budget myths Still, polls also show a huge misconception regarding the cost of the U.S. space program. Public opinion has wrongly put NASA's budget at about 22 percent of the government's spending over the years, when in fact NASA's budget only reached 4.3 percent of the federal budget at its peak in 1965. Since the 1970s, the U.S. space agency's budget has hovered below 1 percent of government spending. &quot;My suggestion is that NASA is so visible and the space shuttle is such a powerful icon that people believe this stuff must cost an enormous amount of money,&quot; Launius said. As for 2010, NASA's budget came in at just six-tenths of 1 percent of all government spending. Neither side of the political aisle seems to have any real interest in boosting NASA's budget, according to Launius. NASA also seems unlikely to get a dramatic budget boost in the near future. While an October 2010 NASA authorization bill signed by the president called for a slight increase in the space agency's funding, that money has yet to be appropriated. Instead, NASA and all other non-military government agencies have been frozen at their 2010 funding levels by a Congressional continuing resolution (a stopgap until a full budget can be agreed upon) that holds until March 4. Finding a prime directive U.S. space agency funding in recent years has depended upon certain congressional interests in protecting NASA-related jobs, as well as a fuzzier &quot;feel-good&quot; sentiment toward keeping the space agency afloat. If NASA ever wants to get a bigger budget to send astronauts back to the moon or beyond, it will need to find compelling reasons – whether they're related to the search for life or a precious &quot;unobtanium&quot; resource worth going after and exploiting, some experts say. Launius also suggested that the lack of political support for returning astronauts to the moon is related to the bigger question hanging over the purpose of human spaceflight – or rather, the lack of clearly defined purpose. &quot;There's an inability of the aerospace community – and I include myself here – to articulate a clear, irrevocable, unassailable rationale for doing this,&quot; Launius said.<br />

<br />
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama cannot escape one giant vulnerability as he bids to keep his job: There are millions of voters who still don't have [jobs] one. Suddenly, the snapshot of the American economy is depressing again. Job creation is down. So is consumer confidence. And homes sales, auto sales, construction spending, manufacturing expansion. The brutal month of May was a reminder of the economy's fragility and the risks for an incumbent president. Nothing that Obama oversees, not even a success as dramatic as finding and killing Osama bin Laden, will matter as much as his handling of the economy. It is the dominant driver of voter behavior. People hold their president accountable if they can't find work in the richest country in the world. The weakening recovery is testing the entire foundation of Obama's optimistic economic message, that the nation is getting stronger all the time. As much as the White House says it never dwells on any single jobs report, and Obama never even mentioned the troubling one released Friday, the stakes get higher by the month. A finally forming field of Republican presidential competitors is maneuvering into the space for the public's attention with this message: Obama has failed. Election Day 2012 is 17 months away, and Obama's campaign knows incremental job growth won't do. The unemployment rate is 9.1 percent. If it stays anywhere near there, Obama will face re-election with a higher jobless rate than any other post-war president. In his favor, Obama still has the loudest voice to sell his message that the longer term trends, including job growth every month, are good. Nearly halfway through a year dominated by foreign events mostly outside his control, he plans to build his next few months around economic events. So what comes next will be a summer when both sides select the economic facts that best suit their case. It will play against a backdrop of trying to cut a massive deficit while letting the nation borrow more so it doesn't default. As Obama pushes his economic agenda, his re-election chances bank on more than job growth. They also depend on how well he can remind people that he inherited a recession and that compared with the early days of 2009, the country is in a better place. &quot;This economy took a big hit,&quot; Obama said Friday in Ohio, a pivotal 2012 state. &quot;You know, it's just like if you had a bad illness, if you got hit by a truck, it's going to take a while for you to mend. And that's what's happened to our economy. It's taking a while to mend.&quot;<br />

<br />
The Obama administration is reportedly considering major reductions in the size the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The administration has reportedly asked the Pentagon to evaluate three options for further cuts: to approximately 1100, 800, or 400 weapons. Any of these scenarios would take the United States well below the ceiling imposed by the New START treaty, which requires the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals to no more than 1,550 deployed weapons. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the strategic value of the U.S. nuclear stockpile has declined significantly in the 21st century. Nuclear weapons have been useless in all of the U.S.’s recent military campaigns — Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. And they offer no protection against terrorist groups and subnational actors, two of the most significant threats facing the United States today. In fact, the Pentagon’s own strategic thinkers have noted that the strategic landscape has changed and that the U.S.’s Cold War-sized arsenal may exceed the country’s current needs. The Defense Department’s strategic guidance document, released in early January, states that “it is possible that our deterrence goals can be achieved with a smaller nuclear force, which would reduce the number of nuclear weapons in our inventory as well as their role in U.S. national security strategy.” Moreover, according to strategists at the Air War College and the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies, the U.S. could draw down its arsenal to 311 survivable reliable weapons and still maintain a credible deterrent. For two reasons, President Obama is wise to reevaluate the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. First, our massive nuclear arsenal is tremendously expensive and diverts funds away from programs designed to bolster the U.S.’s long-term health of the U.S. economy and military. The budget for “nuclear weapons activities” is projected to grow by 6 percent to $18 billion next year in FY 2013. It will be 20 percent higher in real terms than President Reagan’s largest nuclear weapons budget. Further, unless the Pentagon reduces the number of deployed nuclear weapons significantly, it will have to modernize all three legs of the triad at a cost of over $100 billion. Protecting and modernizing our exponentially larger nuclear stockpile adds to the national debt and sucks up taxpayer dollars that could be used to bolster our economy, put people back to work, or invest in technologies that support our men and women serving around the globe. Adopting the Air War College recommendation would save the Pentagon at least $11 billion per year. Second, significant reductions in the U.S. nuclear arsenal would give the Obama administration the moral authority to push for stronger international commitments control the spread weapons-usable nuclear technology and material. President Obama has called nuclear terrorism the “single biggest threat to U.S. security, both short-term, medium-term and long-term.” Demonstrating that the United States is serious about controlling the size of its own nuclear stockpile would breathe life into the global nonproliferation regime, thereby decrease the chances of a terrorist group acquiring a nuclear warhead without undermining U.S. security. Given the fiscal problems facing our nation and historic highs in defense spending, the Obama administration has been right to downsize or eliminate out-dated weapons systems that do little to further American security, like the F-22 and EFV. Surplus nuclear weapons, which are expensive to maintain and protect, should be no exception. Last week, State department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland criticized the Iranian government, stating it “would rather spend money on a nuclear weapons program than on the welfare of its people.” Reducing the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal to more strategically reasonable levels will allow the Obama administration to practice what it preaches.<br />

A nuclear attack by terrorists will be much more critical than Hiroshima and Nagazaki, even if -- and this is far from certain -- the weapons used are less harmful than those used then, Japan, at the time, with no knowledge of nuclear technology, had no choice but to capitulate. Today, the technology is a secret for nobody. So far, except for the two bombs dropped on Japan, nuclear weapons have been used only to threaten. Now we are at a stage where they can be detonated. This completely changes the rules of the game. We have reached a point where anticipatory measures can determine the course of events. Allegations of a terrorist connection can be used to justify anticipatory measures, including the invasion of a sovereign state like Iraq. As it turned out, these allegations, as well as the allegation that Saddam was harbouring WMD, proved to be unfounded. What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? Even if it fails, it would further exacerbate the negative features of the new and frightening world in which we are now living. Societies would close in on themselves, police measures would be stepped up at the expense of human rights, tensions between civilisations and religions would rise and ethnic conflicts would proliferate. It would also speed up the arms race and develop the awareness that a different type of world order is imperative if humankind is to survive. But the still more critical scenario is if the attack succeeds. This could lead to a third world war, from which no one will emerge victorious. Unlike a conventional war which ends when one side triumphs over another, this war will be without winners and losers. When nuclear pollution infects the whole planet, we will all be losers.<br />

BEIJING — China’s top leaders are retaking the initiative after the country’s worst political crisis in a generation, showcasing a united front and moving forward with plans for a major leadership reshuffle later this year. But the ouster of Bo Xilai, the populist icon formerly in charge of the southwestern megacity of Chongqing, has spurred weeks of frenzied internal politicking and a rare dissenting vote within the Politburo Standing Committee, according to interviews with publishers, academics and analysts tied to the Communist Party’s upper echelons or its powerful families. They say that the outward calm is tenuous and was achieved only after China’s leadership team of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao appealed to party elders for support and yielded important posts in Chongqing to representatives of other influential political blocs. “They want everyone to believe that the top level has no problem — that there’s no split and no struggle,” said Jin Zhong, publisher of the influential China-watching magazine Open, in Hong Kong. “But this is a false impression.” According to people briefed by central party officials, Mr. Bo is being confined to his house in Beijing, watched by the Central Guard Bureau, a unit of the People’s Liberation Army under the control of the party’s General Office. He faces a disciplinary investigation over a range of allegations of corruption and abuse of power, these people say. His wife, a noted lawyer, is under more formal detention in connection with some of those allegations. Much is at stake because the party is undergoing its once-in-a-decade leadership reshuffle. Over the next year, the Communist Party will get a new leadership team and general secretary, who will pick a new premier and other top government positions. Until his fall, Mr. Bo was a contender for one of the leadership slots. But in early February, Mr. Bo’s police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to the United States Consulate in Chengdu with damning evidence about his boss. That precipitated a divisive meeting on March 7 of the party’s Standing Committee, the nine-person body that effectively rules China, according to two people close to ruling circles. Eight of the nine top leaders, including the current party boss, Hu Jintao; the country’s premier, Wen Jiabao; the incoming party boss, Xi Jinping; and the incoming premier, Li Keqiang, are said to have supported or gone along with the decision to remove and investigate Mr. Bo. But, crucially, the head of the country’s ubiquitous security services, Zhou Yongkang, resisted, these people said. Mr. Bo was seen as Mr. Zhou’s possible successor and Mr. Zhou had previously endorsed Mr. Bo’s zealous crackdown on organized crime. The position of Mr. Bo’s onetime patron, the former leader Jiang Zemin, was unclear, although he appears not to have intervened in the decision. Mr. Bo failed to attend a Parliament meeting the next day, but at a news conference on March 9, he denied any wrongdoing and predicted that Mr. Hu would eventually visit Chongqing. But on March 15, official media issued a terse statement saying Mr. Bo had been removed from his main post. That was not the end of the effort to forge broader consensus, party insiders say. Instead, top leaders like Mr. Hu and Mr. Wen have met with ministers, provincial leaders and party elders to marshal approval for Mr. Bo’s ouster and solicit views on handling the case. Some of those approached include the former premiers Zhu Rongji and Li Peng, as well as the former top leaders Li Ruihuan and Qiao Shi, people familiar with the matter say. Party officials have also floated trial-balloon versions of the investigation. At closed-door briefings, selected top officials have been read documents from central offices enumerating a range of initial charges against Mr. Bo, they said. Mr. Wang has been branded a “traitor.” Reflecting the uncertainty at the top, some analysts say, online censors have allowed some damaging rumors and details about Mr. Bo and Mr. Zhou to circulate widely, but also tolerated some support for Mr. Bo. But outwardly, top leaders are pushing unity. After failing to appear in person at a national legal conference last week, Mr. Zhou has now been in the Chinese press regularly urging legal and police officials to toe the party line. Mr. Hu has embarked on a trip abroad. On Tuesday, the main army newspaper ordered military officers to ignore “social noise” and “hostile forces,” and to unite under the party. The party congress is also thought to be going ahead largely as planned. Key decisions will not be made until the summer, but a line-up for the nine-person Standing Committee is slowly jelling, with Mr. Bo given almost no chance of assuming a position on it. Instead, he appears to be fighting to retain some kind of ceremonial post and to avoid prison.<br />

In the context of space security, official multilateral treaty verification is necessary for three further reasons. The first is the hazardous nature of the space environment. There are natural and man-made threats to satellites and spacecraft that can cause temporary or permanent damage, including solar radiation and orbital debris. Without a verification system it is difficult to credibly distinguish between natural causes of satellite failure and the effects of weapons use. The second emerges from dual use problems of space verification technology: unilateral monitoring activities by individual states may be interpreted as offensive in nature and potentially provoke a protection-negation arms race. For example, a close-proximity flyby to inspect a satellite could easily be interpreted as an interception attempt or surveillance for military advantage. The only way to engage in such sensitive activities in a non-provocative manner is to do so multilaterally. Third, there are many dozens of state and commercial actors with space assets, yet current capabilities for knowing what is happening in space are limited to only a handful of states. This means that verification of any allegations of illicit space weapon deployment or use is at the moment dependent upon the national technical means (NTM) of a select few.<br />

Mr. Bo’s continuing influence helps explain why the party has not issued a fuller explanation. He is still, formally, a member of the 25-member Politburo, and commands support among some generals, descendants of revolutionaries and others in the Communist Party’s left wing who are uneasy about the loss of traditional Communist ideology. Ultimately, even if Mr. Bo is found to have had corrupt dealings, those who have supported him within the party hierarchy are likely to insist on concessions for his removal from power. Already, horse-trading appears to have begun. Mr. Bo’s temporary replacement in Chongqing, Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang, is like Mr. Bo a protégé of Mr. Jiang and a contender for promotion to the Standing Committee. A veteran of Mr. Hu’s political power base was positioned to replace Mr. Wang atop Chongqing’s police force, only to be transferred in recent days in favor of another man closer to Mr. Zhou’s camp.<br />

Failure of reform causes multiple nuclear wars<br />

<br />
The fourth factor contributing to the perception of a China threat is the fear of political and economic collapse in the PRC, resulting in territorial fragmentation, civil war and waves of refugees pouring into neighboring countries. Naturally, any or all of the scenarios would have a profoundly negative impact on regional stability. Today the Chinese leadership faces a raft of internal problems, including the increasing political demands of its citizens, a growing population, a shortage of natural resources and a deterioration in the natural environment caused by rapid industrialization and pollution. These problems are putting a strain on the central government’s ability to govern effectively. Political disintegration or a Chinese civil war might result in millions of Chinese refugees seeking asylum in neighboring countries. Such an unprecedented exodus of refugees from a collapsed PRC would no doubt put a severe strain on the limited resources of China’s neighbors. A fragmented China could also result in another nightmare scenario- nuclear weapons falling into the hands of irresponsible local provincial leaders or warlords. From this perspective, a disintegrating China would also pose a threat to its neighbors and the world.<br />

Finding 3.12. The NSWP has made relatively little effort to consider international partnering opportunities for collecting space weather data and distributing space weather information products. The worldwide space weather community would benefit by much more aggressive collection of space weather data by other countries. Recommendation 3.12.1. The NSWP should consider the benefits (and possible drawbacks) of establishing a formal international coordination mechanism for the promotion, collection, and distribution of space weather data, including all forms of space weather data from satellites and ground-based sensors. Such a program could be structured and operated along the lines of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), which was formed in 1984 to address similar concerns within the Earth observations community. CEOS operates with minimal institutional resources and no central office. Nevertheless, it has been highly effective as the organizational basis for an international system of Earth observation satellites, which service the international needs for such data. The NSWP might even explore the option of establishing a coordinated, international effort under the aegis of CEOS. This option would allow the NSWP to make use of the established CEOS organization and its many members to explore the value of improved provision of space weather data for the world. Additional opportunities for data and research coordination may be possible through the ICSU-chartered International Space Environment Service (ISES).<br />

Growing awareness of space debris threats has led to the development of a number of efforts to decrease the amount of new debris, beginning at the national level. NASA first issued guidelines on limiting orbital debris in the August 1995 NASA Safety Standard 1740. In December 2000 the US government issued formal orbital debris mitigation standards for space operators. These standards were developed by DOD and NASA. In 2004 the US Federal Communications Commission imposed requirements for satellite operators to move geostationary satellites at the end of their operating life into “graveyard orbits” some 200 to 300 km above GEO, and in 2005 new rules went into effect requiring satellite system operators to submit orbital debris mitigation plans.34 In 2008 NASA published the first edition of the Handbook for Limiting Orbital Debris, which presents the scientific background for debris mitigation procedures.35 The European Space Agency (ESA) initiated a space debris mitigation effort in 1998. The ESA Space Debris Mitigation Handbook was published in 1999 and revised in 2002.36 Also in 2002 ESA issued the European Space Debris Safety and Mitigation Standard37 and issued new debris mitigation guidelines in 2003. As well, the European Union’s Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities, expected to be open for subscription in 2010, calls on states to “refrain from intentional destruction of any on-orbit space object or other harmful activities which may generate long-lived space debris.”38 Japan and Russia also appear to strongly support the mitigation of space debris production. China, although a member of the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), has been slow to adopt debris mitigation measures.39 (The IADC includes representatives of the space agencies of China, Europe [ESA], France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, the UK, and the US.) At the 2003 annual meeting of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), China committed to “undertake the study and development of Chinese design norms to mitigate space debris, in conformity with the principles reflected in the space debris mitigation guidelines developed by the Coordination Committee.”40<br />

Weaponization of space will create conditions that will make space travel risky if not impossible. Having extended the illogic of opposing space weapons to the limit, opponents then take on the mechanics of war and the evils of the military. As for the first argument, orbital debris is the challenge, which the recent Chinese antisatellite (ASAT) test confirms. The destruction of its own dying satellite in 2007 created thousands of bits of debris that are now floating at orbital velocity, an expanding cloud that poses a lasting navigational hazard to legitimate space flight. True, the Chinese test was criminal, especially since it could have engaged with almost no debris remnants if it had altered its engagement path. In over a dozen antisatellite tests that the Soviet Union held in the 1970s and 1980s, only the first left appreciable debris. After that, the massive co-orbital ASAT engaged in a kinetic direction toward the Earth, down the gravity well, causing all of the detritus of the ASAT and target to burn up in the atmosphere. Indeed, in a scenario where the United States is controlling space, most engagements would occur in launch phase, before the weapons even reach orbit. Any debris that is not burned up or destroyed will fall onto the launching state. Because tested weapons systems have maximized destruction to validate capabilities does not mean that future engagements must create long-lasting debris fields. Satellites are very fragile, and a bump or a push in the wrong direction is all that is necessary to send them spinning off into a useless or uncontrollable orbit—if you get to space first. Space war does not have to be dirty war, and in fact spacefaring nations will go out of their way to ensure that it is not (an argument that nonspacefaring powers may wish to fight dirty, and the only reliable defense against them would be in space, occurs below).<br />

No Russian launch on warning<br />
Blair, 2006, Bruce G., President of the World Security Institute.

He is presently completing a new book on U.S. nuclear policy. Chen Yali is the editor in chief of Washington Observer.

<br />
Launch on warning quickly lost its viability in the Russian nuclear posture, however.10 The United States began in 1992 deploying accurate high-yield submarine missiles capable of destroying hardened targets, and thereby severely degraded Russia’s ability to launch its strategic missiles before they were destroyed on the ground. Russian forces within range of Trident D-5 missiles in the Atlantic and Pacific could no longer beat the clock to launch in time for them to survive. All targets in Russia could be struck by deadly submarine rockets with pinpoint accuracy in less time than it took for Russia to launch on warning, even if the Russian early warning network performed well and provided reliable timely reports of incoming Trident warheads. In addition, as the professors correctly note, the Russian early warning system of satellite infra-red and ground radar sensors has deteriorated sharply over the past decade.11 As a result, there are some gaping holes in Russian coverage of Trident submarine missile corridors, particularly in the Pacific region. This decline further eroded any Russian margin for reliable launch on warning, but as noted above that margin previously evaporated with the advent of Trident silo-busting missiles with flight times that are shorter than Russian nuclear decision cycles. This double-whammy – unreliable Russian warning and Trident missiles outracing Russian speed of response – all but ruled out launch on warning by Russia as a practical matter, even though it remains the cornerstone of Russian strategy to this day. The professors’ assumption in their model that Russia would be forced to absorb the brunt of a U.S. preemptive or preventive strike before it could retaliate is thus a reasonable one. It withstands the scrutiny and criticism of a leading Russian scholar based at Stanford who challenges the professors’ characterization of Russian early warning on the grounds that “…Russia would gain very little were its early warning system to be deployed to the fullest extent. Adding the capability to detect SLBM launches would not dramatically increase the time available to the Russian leadership for assessing attacks.”12 We would agree with these statements in that a full-scale U.S. first strike would doubtless entail so many launches by so many different delivery vehicles from so many directions that in all likelihood the Russian early warning system would sound the alarm early and loudly despite its hobbled condition. And Russia would gain little in any case inasmuch as its forces still could not launch in time to escape destruction on the ground. The Russian critic is right, but it does not invalidate the professors’ assumption of Russia’s inability to launch on warning.<br />

Constraints on the capacity of adversaries also needs to be taken into account. Russia under Putin has put pressure on its immediate neighbors and seeks to rebuild its armed forces, but Moscow’s ability to regain the superpower status of the former Soviet Union remains limited. The Russian armed forces are in woeful condition, the total population is half that of the USSR and declining by 700,000 per year, the economy is overwhelmingly dependent on revenues from oil and natural gas and thus vulnerable if world market prices soften, and the long term stability of its crony capitalism and increasingly authoritarian political system are uncertain. China, despite extraordinary economic growth and modernization, will continue to depend on rapid expansion of trade and the absorption of vast numbers of people moving from the countryside to the cities. It may well become a major military challenger of the United States, first regionally and even globally, but only over the long term.<br />

&lt;&lt;First, the present dispute lacks the Cold War’s system-forming element, that is, bipolarity. In addition to the global and transregional centers of economic and military force, such as the U.S., the EU, Japan, Russia and China, the world is witnessing the growth of regional leaders, among them India, Pacific ‘small tigers,’ member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Iran, Brazil, South Africa and Nigeria. Additionally, the mighty currents of globalization and the information revolution are eroding traditional forms of interstate relations. Nor can we discount the ubiquitous growth of nationalism, and the increased role of transnational economic, political and even military actors. Russian-U.S. relations no longer represent the central axis of global politics. It is just one of its many facets – and not the most important one in many issues. Apart from some contradictions, Russia and the West share major common interests. Finally, they have other competitors beside themselves. Thus, a zero-sum game is out of the question. Whatever disagreements may divide Russia and the West, they are on the same side of the barricades in the ongoing international conflicts. In Afghanistan, for example, they act jointly, seeking to prevent a resurgence of Taliban and al-Qaeda activities. On other issues, such as the nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran, and the situations involving Palestine and Nagorno-Karabakh, they are attempting to solve these problems through multilateral negotiations. The once irreconcilable ideological rivalry between the two parties is now relegated to the past. The real ideological divide now lies between liberal-democratic values and Islamic radicalism, between the North and the South, and between the forces of globalization and anti-globalization. Russia may not be fertile ground for liberal values, but it will certainly never embrace radical Islam. Over the last 20 years, Russia has sustained the greatest losses in the struggle against Islamic extremism (the war in Afghanistan, and the wars and conflicts in Chechnya, Dagestan and Tajikistan).<br />

Sagan's critique is a healthy antidote to Waltz's optimism. In his view, there are two principal arguments that suggest pessimism about any future with a greater number of nuclear-armed adversaries. From his study of militaries, Sagan finds that their organizational behavior inclines them towards deterrence failure. It is not that militaries want war but that, of all groups in a society, they are the most likely to believe war is probable and are most inclined to adopt preventive or preemptive strategies. Military officers are more skeptical of nonmilitary solutions to conflicts than are their civilian counterparts, according to Sagan. It also makes sense, in classical military terms, to adopt preventive or preemptive strategies, since no military prefers to fight on its adversary's terms. Taking the offensive alleviates some of these problems. Secondly, Sagan argues that newly armed nuclear states will lack the positive mechanisms of civilian control. Here, Sagan's critique is very strong. By examining the history of the U.S. nuclear safety record he is able to document many near accidents and bureaucratic snafus that could have led to catastrophic accidents, and in this way he points out the weakness in Waltz's arguments. Sagan comments: Waltz asked why should we expect new nuclear states to experience greater difficulties than did the old ones? The evidence of the number of near-accidents with U.S. nuclear weapons during the Cold War suggests that there would be reason enough to worry about nuclear accidents in new nuclear states even if their safety difficulties were &quot;only&quot; as great as those experienced by old nuclear powers (p. 80). He adds six reasons why new nuclear powers are unlikely to compile the safety record of the United States. But if the problem is acute for newly emergent nuclear powers that develop their programs indigenously, it will be doubly so for those that inherit or buy their programs. They will lack even the discipline that a new nuclear nation will accrue by investing enormous amounts of time, talent, and treasure into developing its nuclear program.<br />

Ignore low-probability impacts like short term asteroids- key to decisionmaking<br />

<br />
Now, it makes sense for the appropriate agencies to make plans for the evacuation of cities in the event of a levee breaking or a power plant disaster. These “incidents” are plausible, or at least thinkable. Better safe than sorry. A collision with an asteroid or comet, on the other hand, is so highly implausible, so exceedingly unlikely, that “planning” for it is a potent blend of the useless and the expensive. Boosting the DHS’s National Response Plan was Evan R. Seamone, writing in 2004 in the Georgetown International Environmental Law Review. Seamone bemoaned that “Current legal and policy efforts to enable adequate defense against potential asteroid or comet collisions with the earth are insufficient because they are indirectly premised upon theories that require verification of a clear and imminent threat before governmental agencies can act.” In other words, the antediluvian theories that underlay our system and the systems of most other governments of the world require that there be an actual threat before the state is mobilized to meet that threat. Obviously the philosophers who spin such theories never saw Armageddon on DVD. As an alternative for the 21st century, Seamone proposed a “precautionary principle” as the cornerstone of a governmental asteroid defense program. This tenet — which might also be known as the fling-open-the-doors-to-the-Treasury principle — “requires governments to take action to prevent harm even when it is uncertain if, when, or where the harm will occur.”<br />

Asteroid strike won’t cause extinction—even if they did we have 40 million years to prepare<br />

It should be noted that the Alvarez et al. hypothesis was not universally accepted. As Peter M. Sheehan and Dale A. Russell wrote in their paper “Faunal Change Following the Cretaceous–Tertiary Impact: Using Paleontological Data to Assess the Hazards of Impacts,” published in Hazards Due to Comets &amp; Asteroids (1994), edited by Tom Gehrels, “many paleontologists resist accepting a cause and effect relationship” between the iridum evidence, the Chicxulub crater, and the mass extinction of 65 million years ago.15 For instance, Dennis V. Kent of the Lamont–Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University, writing in Science, disputed that a high concentration of iridium is necessarily “associated with an extraordinary extraterrestrial event” and that, moreover, “a large asteroid… is not likely to have had the dire consequences to life on the earth that they propose.”16 Briefly, Kent argues that the Alvarez team mistakenly chose the 1883 Krakatoa eruption as the standard from it extrapolated the effects of stratospheric material upon sunlight. Yet Krakatoa was too small a volcanic eruption from which to draw any such conclusions; better, says Kent, is the Toba caldera in Sumatra, remnant of an enormous eruption 75,000 years ago. (A caldera is the imprint left upon the earth from a volcanic eruption.) The volume of the Toba caldera is 400 times as great as that of Krakatoa – considerably closer to the effect that an asteroid impact might have. Yet the sunlight “attenuation factor [for Toba] is not nearly as large as the one postulated by Alvarez et al. for the asteroid impact.” Indeed, the Toba eruption is not associated with any mass extinctions, leading Kent to believe that “the cause of the massive extinctions is not closely related to a drastic reduction in sunlight alone.”17 Reporting in Science, Richard A. Kerr wrote that “Many geologists, paleontologists, astronomers, and statisticians… find the geological evidence merely suggestive or even nonexistent and the supposed underlying mechanisms improbable at best.” Even the iridium anomalies have been challenged: Bruce Corliss of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute argues that the major extinctions associated with the K–T event were not immediate and catastrophic but “gradual and apparently linked to progressive climate change.”18 Others argue that a massive volcanic event predating the Alvarezian killer asteroid created an overwhelming greenhouse effect and set the dinosaurs up for the knockout punch. A considerable number of scientists believe that gradually changing sea levels were the primary cause of the K–T Extinction. If either of these hypotheses is true – and a substantial number of geologists hold these positions — then the “killer asteroid” is getting credit that it does not deserve. Even if the K–T Extinction was the work of a rock from space, the Alvarez team credits a “probable interval of 100 million years between collisions with 10-km-diameter objects.”19 The next rendezvous with annihilation won’t be overdue for about 40 million years.

Asteroids have never killed anyone- reject there evidence as alarmism fabricated for funding<br />

We should here acknowledge, without necessarily casting aspersions on any of the papers discussed in this chapter, the tendency of scientific journals to publish sexy articles. (Sexy, at least, by the decidedly unsexy standards of scientific journals.) Writing in the Public Library of Science, Neal S. Young of the National Institutes of Health, John P.A. Ioannidis of the Biomedical Research Institute in Greece, and Omar Al-Ubaydli of George Mason University applied what economists call the “winner’s curse” of auction theory to scientific publishing. Just as the winner in, say, an auction of oil drilling rights is the firm that has made the highest estimation — often overestimation — of a reserve’s size and capacity, so those papers that are selected for publication in the elite journals of science are often those with the most “extreme, spectacular results.”63 These papers may make headlines in the mainstream press, which leads to greater political pressure to fund projects and programs congruent with these extreme findings. As The Economist put it in an article presenting the argument of Young, Ioannidis, and Al-Ubaydli, “Hundreds of thousands of scientific researchers are hired, promoted and funded according not only to how much work they produce, but also where it gets published.” Column inches in journals such as Nature and Science are coveted; authors understand full well that studies with spectacular results are more likely to be published than are those that will not lead to a wire story. The problem, though, is that these flashy papers with dramatic results often “turn out to be false.”64 In a 2005 paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Ioannidis found that “of the 49 most-cited papers on the effectiveness of medical interventions, published in highly visible journals in 1990–2004… a quarter of the randomised trials and five of six nonrandomised studies had already been contradicted or found to have been exaggerated by 2005.” Thus, those who pay the price of the winner’s curse in scientific research are those, whether sick patients or beggared taxpayers, who are forced to either submit to or fund specious science, medical or otherwise. The trio of authors call the implications of this finding “dire,” pointing to a 2008 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that “almost all trials” of anti-depressant medicines that had had positive results had been published, while almost all trials of anti-depressants that had come up with negative results “remained either unpublished or were published with the results presented so that they would appear ‘positive.’” Young, Ioannidis, and Al-Ubaydli conclude that “science is hard work with limited rewards and only occasional successes. Its interest and importance should speak for themselves, without hyperbole.” Elite journals, conscious of the need to attract attention and stay relevant, cutting edge, and avoid the curse of stodginess, are prone to publish gross exaggeration and findings of dubious merit. When lawmakers and grant-givers take their cues from these journals, as they do, those tax dollars ostensibly devoted to the pursuit of pure science and the application of scientific research are diverted down unprofitable, even impossible channels. The charlatans make names for themselves, projects of questionable merit grow fat on the public purse, and the disconnect between what is real and what subsidy-seekers tell us is real gets ever wider.65 The matter, or manipulation, of odds in regards to a collision between a space rock and Earth would do Jimmy the Greek proud. As Michael B. Gerrard writes in Risk Analysis in an article assessing the relative allocation of public funds to hazardous waste site cleanup and protection against killer comets and asteroids, “Asteroids and comets are… the ultimate example of a low-probability/high-consequence event: no one in recorded human history is confirmed to have ever died from one.” Gerrard writes that “several billion people” will die as the result of an impact “at some time in the coming half million years,” although that half-million year time-frame is considerably shorter than the generally accepted extinction-event period.66 The expected deaths from a collision with an asteroid of, say, one kilometer or more in diameter are so huge that by jacking up the tiny possibility of such an event even a little bit the annual death rate of this never-beforeexperienced disaster exceeds deaths in plane crashes, earthquakes, and other actual real live dangers. Death rates from outlandish or unusual causes are fairly steady across the years. About 120 Americans die in airplane crashes annually, and about 90 more die of lightning strikes. Perhaps five might die in garage-door opener accidents. The total number of deaths in any given year by asteroid or meteor impact is zero — holding constant since the dawn of recorded time.<br />

<br />
Cooler heads intervened. Donald Yeomans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said, “The comet will pass no closer to the Earth than 60 lunar distances [14 million miles] on August 5, 2126. There is no evidence for a threat from Swift-Tuttle in 2126 nor from any other known comet or asteroid in the next 200 years.”96 Even Brian Marsden concurred. He retracted his prediction, though he held out the possibility that in the year 3034 the comet could come within a million miles of Earth. Surveying this very false and very loud alarm, Sally Stephens, writing in the journal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, observed, “Marsden’s prediction, and later retraction, of a possible collision between the Earth and the comet highlight the fact that we will most likely have century-long warnings of any potential collision, based on calculations of orbits of known and newly discovered asteroids and comets. Plenty of time to decide what to do.”97<br />

<br />
Absent a panic, the lack of any popular support for “Earth defense” vexes the Earth-savers. One lesson of human history, say Robert L. Park of the American Physical Society, Lori B. Garver of the National Space Society, and Terry Dawson of the U.S. House of Representatives, is that “societies will not sustain indefinitely a defense against an infrequent and unpredictable threat.” There is almost no popular constituency for asteroid defense, and it is sheer hubris to believe that any defense we are capable of designing today will be of anything more than “historical interest” to our descendants a century or a millennium hence.57 We are not the alpha and the omega. Our most sophisticated weapons will be to our distant descendants as spears are to us. As for defense against comets, the lesser-discussed threat from the skies, they are “astonishingly intractable,” write Clark R. Chapman, Daniel D. Durda, and Robert E. Gold.58 Hard to find, their motions difficult to predict, their structure and consistency questionable, comets are the wild card in the deck of Earth-killers, though since one hasn’t hit us in at least many tens of millions of years, only the most hopeless superlunary hypochondriac is going to lose much sleep over them.<br />

<span class="Underline">Which naturally leads to relations with the U.S., the subject of the penultimate chapter of Shirk's book. Beijing has an incentive to maintain good relations with the U.S. – the PRC would suffer greatly from American economic sanctions let alone military hostility, and &quot;the best way for China to rise peacefully is to behave like a responsible power and accommodate to the current superpower, the United States.&quot; If only life was so simple. Warns Shirk: &quot;on the other hand, inside China, other leaders, the public, and the military expect Chinese leaders to stand up to the United States. Nationalist ardor runs high, fanned by government propaganda and the commercial media and Internet. The United States, as the dominant power in the world, is the natural target of suspicion and resentment in China, just as it is in many other countries, particularly after the American invasion of Iraq. A Chinese political leader who takes a principled stand against the United States always wins more points than one who gives in to it.&quot; Where does the U.S. go from here? As is so often the case in international relations, responsible statesmanship is necessary on both sides of the Pacific. Moreover, she adds, &quot;only by understanding the dangers of China's domestic fragility and incorporating this understanding into their policies can Chinese and American decision makers avoid a catastrophic war.&quot; She advocates a series of sensible steps – focusing on Chinese international behavior, downplaying American military power, demonstrating respect for China, working in Chinese-Taiwanese relations, and not overreacting to China's economic rise. But that's not enough. Shirk wants to maintain &quot;a strong military presence&quot; in the region and opposes building up Japan as a military power. As she notes, &quot;Preventing war with a rising China is one of the most difficult foreign policy challenges our country faces.&quot; That being the case, Washington should emphasize conflict avoidance, stepping back militarily while shifting defense responsibilities onto allied and friendly states. Perhaps the most important duty for U.S. policymakers today is to distinguish between vital interests, such as defending America, and peripheral interests, such as attempting to dictate events in East Asia in the face of a rising China. The world in which America can micro-manage international events is disappearing. Washington, too, must learn to accommodate. And America's interest will best be served by stepping back from confrontation where its vital interests are not involved. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Small conflicts with China could escalate into a nuclear conflict – err on the side of caution</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Fisher 11 (Max, Associate Editor at the Atlantic, Editor of the International Channel, “5 Most Likely Ways the US and China Could Spark Accidental Nuclear War”) </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">There's a near-infinite number of small-scale conflicts that could come up between the U.S. and China, and though none of them should escalate any higher than a few tough words between diplomats, it's the unpredictable events that are the most dangerous. In 1983 alone, the U.S. and Soviet Union almost went to war twice over bizarre and unforeseeable events. In September, the Soviet Union shot down a Korean airliner it mistook for a spy plane; first Soviet officials feared the U.S. had manufactured the incident as an excuse to start a war, then they refused to admit their error, nearly pushing the U.S. to actually start war. Two months later, Soviet spies misread an elaborate U.S. wargame (which the U.S. had unwisely kept secret) as preparations for an unannounced nuclear hit on Moscow, nearly leading them to launch a preemptive strike. In both cases, one of the things that ultimately diverted disaster was the fact that both sides clearly nderstood the others' red lines -- as long as they didn't cross them, they could remain confident there would be no nuclear war. But the U.S. and China have not yet clarified their red lines for nuclear strikes. The kinds of bizarre, freak accidents that the U.S. and Soviet Union barely survived in 1983 might well bring today's two Pacific powers into conflict -- unless, of course, they can clarify their rules. Of the many ways that the U.S. and China could stumble into the nightmare scenario that neither wants, here are five of the most likely. Any one of these appears to be extremely unlikely in today's world. But that -- like the Soviet mishaps of the 1980s -- is exactly what makes them so dangerous.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">But what would that &quot;victory&quot; entail? An attack with these Chinese nuclear weapons would immediately slaughter at least 10 million Americans in a great storm of blast and fire, while leaving many more dying horribly of sickness and radiation poisoning. The Chinese death toll in a nuclear war would be far higher. Both nations would be reduced to smoldering, radioactive wastelands. Also, radioactive debris sent aloft by the nuclear explosions would blot out the sun and bring on a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; around the globe -- destroying agriculture, creating worldwide famine, and generating chaos and destruction. Moreover, in another decade the extent of this catastrophe would be far worse. The Chinese government is currently expanding its nuclear arsenal, and by the year 2020 it is expected to more than double its number of nuclear weapons that can hit the United States. The U.S. government, in turn, has plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars &quot;modernizing&quot; its nuclear weapons and nuclear production facilities over the next decade. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Extinction risks constitute an especially severe subset of what could go badly wrong for humanity. There are many possible global catastrophes that would cause immense worldwide damage, maybe even the collapse of modern civilization, yet fall short of terminating the human species. An all-out nuclear war between Russia and the United States might be an example of a global catastrophe that would be unlikely to result in extinction. A terrible pandemic with high virulence and 100% mortality rate among infected individuals might be another example: if some groups of humans could successfully quarantine themselves before being exposed, human extinction could be avoided even if, say, 95% or more of the world's population succumbed. What distinguishes extinction and other existential catastrophes is that a comeback is impossible. A non-existential disaster causing the breakdown of global civilization is, from the perspective of humanity as a whole, a potentially recoverable setback: a giant massacre for man, a small misstep for mankind.</span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">Given that there “is no known incident of a major crater-forming impact in recorded human history,” argues P.R. Weissman of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and since “the credibility of the impact hazard” is justifiably low with the public and governmental decision-makers, we ought to defer the development of a defensive system until such time as technological advances permit us to do so at a reasonable cost.55 There is also, he points out — at the risk of being called chauvinist, no doubt, by the more feverish Earth-savers — the “pragmatic and/or parochial” fact that the United States accounts for 6.4 percent of the total land mass of the Earth, and only 1.9 percent of the total area, including water.56 Thus anything short of a civilization-ending asteroid would be exceedingly unlikely to hit the U.S. By contrast, such threats as infectious diseases and nuclear war present a more real and immediate danger to Americans, and to earthlings in general. Perhaps money would be better spent addressing those matters? </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">For a near-impossible scenario, an awful lot of laser ink has gone into studies of the consequences of an impact. Let’s face it: The topic is sexy. The effects of an Earth-space rock collision with energies below 10 Megatons would be “negligible,” write Owen B. Toon, Kevin Zahnle, and David Morrison of the NASA Ames Research Center, Richard P. Turco of UCLA, and Curt Covey of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in Reviews of Geophysics. Impacts measuring between 10 Megatons and 10 to the 4th power Megatons — say, comets and asteroids with diameters of less than 400 meters and 650 meters, respectively — would be equivalent “to many natural disasters of recent history.” In other words, death-dealing but manageable in a global sense. Those with an energy range in the 10 to the 5th–6th power Megatons are “transitional” — the fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis would unleash devastation, though the authors do not believe a “global catastrophe” would occur at less than an energy level of 10 to the 6th power Megatons. They do admit to “considerable uncertainty,” noting that previous estimates may have overstated the damage at certain levels of impact, though they say, with great wisdom, that “it is to be hoped that no large-scale terrestrial experiments occur to shed light on our theoretical oversights.”59 They can say that again. The impact upon the Earth of an object of more than 400 meters in diameter crashing into an ocean would be a tsunami, an enormous wave created by the impact of the asteroid or comet upon the ocean floor, which could cause massive numbers of deaths due to drowning, though it would be highly unlikely to cause extinction of the human species. A wall of water — a wave over 60 meters high — would sweep over the impacted ocean’s coasts. The huge and widespread fires would claim uncounted lives, too, and the “opacity of the smoke generated by the fires” would contribute to the sharply reduced level of sunlight upon the Earth. The consequences of an impact with an energy of 10 to the 7th power Megatons could be K–T like, as 100-meters-high tsunamis swamp coastal zones, fires rage around the world, and “Light levels may drop so low from the smoke, dust, and sulfate as to make vision impossible.”60 Photosynthesis, too, becomes impossible, and food supplies disappear. Dwellers in sea and on land perish of fire, starvation, or flood. In the aftermath, survivors would compete with rodents for the available food. (As paleontologists Peter M. Sheehan and Dale A. Russell note, “In the short term domestic cats might play a useful role in protecting food supplies.”61 Humans, they believe, would survive such a catastrophe, though in greatly reduced numbers and for millennia they would be vegetarians practicing subsistence agriculture. No doubt, that sounds appealing to some of the greener readers.) If an impact with a smaller body is sometimes compared to the aftermath of a nuclear war, the fact that in a war the civilian infrastructure is specifically targeted means that it is “much more likely that society could cope with the problems following a small impact better than it could adjust to the problems following a nuclear war,” according to Toon, Zahnle, et al.62 Interestingly, the authors say that acid rain — very much a fashionable environmental cause in the 1980s, though it has since receded before global warming — would not be a widespread problem, although the rain may well be acidified due to the nitric oxide resulting from impact-induced shock waves.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">After apparently engineering the contretemps that have hit Chongqing Party Secretary Bo Xilai, President Hu Jintao is putting additional pressure on other members of the Gang of Princelings—the political faction composed of senior cadres’ offspring. The political fortunes of Bo, the high-profile son of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) elder Bo Yibo, have nosedived following the recent detention of his key protégé, Wang Lijun, on alleged “economic crimes.” Regardless of the veracity about the speculation that the 62-year-old princeling offered to resign from the Politburo, Bo’s chances for making the Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC) at the 18th Party Congress later this year seem over. Last week, Bo reportedly wrote a “letter of self-criticism” to the PBSC in which he blamed himself for failing to detect the alleged corruption and other misdemeanors of former Chongqing Vice-Mayor Wang, who reportedly tried to seek political asylum in the United States Consulate in Chengdu earlier this month (Ming Pao [Hong Kong], February 22; China Digital Times, February 21; Reuters, February 15). Political observers in Beijing are closely watching two related developments. The first is which senior cadre will likely acquire the PBSC seat which Bo seemed to have a high chance of filling. The second and perhaps more significant issue is the fate of the so-called “Chongqing Model” associated with Bo, particularly the large-scale resuscitation of Maoist values and culture that is symbolized by the popular “singing red songs” (changhong) campaign. Since the Wang Lijun saga, however, the mainstream media has been replete with commentaries advocating ideological and political liberalization. Particularly given that other pedigreed cadres such as Vice President Xi Jinping also have taken part in the changhong movement, are these pro-reformist articles yet another weapon used by President Hu and his associates to lay into the Gang of Princelings (Apple Daily [Hong Kong] February 27; Associated Press, February 15)? Are there also possibilities that the recent outburst of reformist sentiments will persist beyond the 18th CCP Congress? </span><br />

<span class="Underline">But effective energy sanctions don’t have to raise oil prices; they can actually do the opposite. Washington just has to learn how to leverage greed. We should bar from operating in the United States any European and most Asian energy companies that deal in Iranian oil and work with the Iranian central bank, Revolutionary Guards or National Oil Company. At the same time, however, we should allow companies from countries that have little interest in Iran’s nuclear program, or its pro-democracy Green Movement, and that are willing to risk their access to American markets — mainly Chinese companies — to continue buying Iranian crude in whatever quantity they desire. This would reduce the number of buyers of Iranian petroleum, without reducing the quantity of oil on the market. With fewer buyers to compete with, the Chinese companies would have significant negotiating leverage with which to extract discounts from Tehran. The government could lose out on tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue, loosening its hold on power. This approach may seem distasteful to some, because it does, in a sense, reward bad Chinese behavior. But the objective of sanctions is to cause real economic pain in Tehran, not to make Americans feel moral. It would also, admittedly, be a hassle for many of our allies, but the short-term diplomatic trauma would not overwhelm Washington. And most important, markets would react in a rational way. The Obama administration is obviously worried that more robust sanctions could shut down the export of oil and spook the markets. But support for such measures is rising in Congress. A powerful bipartisan coalition has developed in the House demanding an investigation of the Iranian central bank to “expeditiously determine” whether it’s been involved in aiding terrorist activities or the development and proliferation of unconventional weapons. Severe sanctions against the bank would immediately follow. But such sanctions need to be targeted correctly. If we selectively prohibited oil transactions among those companies we could influence, while not enforcing sanctions against Chinese energy firms, energy traders would quickly sense that only the number of purchasers had changed, while the quantity of oil on the market remained the same. And the Obama administration just might ride into the 2012 elections with the Islamic Republic in turmoil. Iran hawks should not view sanctions as a pusillanimous cop-out. Like President Obama’s failed attempt at diplomatic engagement, sanctions are an unavoidable and necessary prelude to any more forceful action to stop Ayatollah Khamenei’s nuclear ambitions. America may be in for a long cold-war struggle in which sanctions will play a critical role in weakening Tehran. And the Islamic Republic hardly has the resources of the Soviet Union. This time, sanctions might actually, sooner rather than later, put our enemy on his knees. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">November 11, 2011: China has complained to Japan about increasing Japanese air reconnaissance missions off the Chinese coast. Although these electronic recon missions are in international waters, China considers the Japanese aircraft too close and a threat. This sort of thing is a growing problem with China. That's because the waters 360 kilometers from land are considered the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), of the nation controlling the nearest land. The EEZ owner can control who fishes there, and extracts natural resources (mostly oil and gas) from the ocean floor. But the EEZ owner cannot prohibit free passage, or the laying of pipelines and communications cables. China claims that foreign aircraft and ships conduct illegal espionage on Chinese bases and military training. The 1994 treaty says nothing about such matters. China is simply doing what China has been doing for centuries, trying to impose its will on neighbors, or anyone venturing into what China considers areas under its control. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Today, no accepted definition of a space weapon exists. Case in point: Recently, Space.com quoted a senior Pentagon official as saying, &quot;There are no space weapons programs being funded by the U.S. Air Force.&quot; This statement was immediately criticized by many within the space arms control community as hypocritical and false. They cited the ongoing development of ground-based missile defense assets as evidence, along with dual-use space programs such as XSS-11 and MiTex and doctrinal statements of the importance of &quot;space dominance.&quot; Some experts consider a space weapon to be an object or device in orbit that is used to strike targets on the ground. Others consider a space weapon to be an object or device that can strike other targets in space. Still others consider a space weapon to be anything that can attack, degrade, or destroy satellites--whether from space, the ground, or air. These diverse definitions have frozen the international arms control debate over space weapons for decades. For example, some within the space arms control community applauded the introduction by Russia and China in February 2008 of a draft treaty to the Conference on Disarmament that purports to ban space weapons. But that treaty only addresses objects that are in orbit. It doesn't cover ground-based antisatellite weapons. Thus, if implemented, the treaty would prohibit any space-based missile defense interceptors--an essential part of the U.S. missile defense system--while allowing for the continued research and development of Russian and Chinese antisatellite missiles. This leads to the impression that the goal of the proposed treaty is to hamstring the U.S. missile defense capability while allowing its potential adversaries to retain their capability to counter U.S. space superiority. Debate over the definition of a space weapon isn't new. The Soviet Union once considered the space shuttle to be a space weapon because it could be used to capture, destroy, or inspect satellites. More recently, an argument was put forth that space-based solar power satellites would be a space weapon, because the method of transmitting energy to the ground (whether laser or microwave) could be used to interfere with satellites or objects on the ground, even if it wasn't powerful enough to destroy them. Immediately after President Barack Obama's inauguration, the following statement appeared on the White House website: &quot;The Obama-Biden administration will restore American leadership on space issues, seeking a worldwide ban on weapons that interfere with military and commercial satellites. They will thoroughly assess possible threats to U.S. space assets and the best options, military and diplomatic, for countering them, establishing contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.&quot; Many within the space arms control community seized upon this as proof that the Obama administration would back an international treaty banning space weapons. But it should be noted that the statement isn't (yet) official U.S. policy. According to comments made by John Logsdon, the director of George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, at the February International Space University Symposium on Space and Security, it reportedly originated from an Obama campaign white paper and was transferred verbatim to the White House website by a junior staffer without input from any of the governmental bodies that manage national policy. Even if the United States does decide to make the statement official policy, that doesn't mean it will use a legally binding treaty as the implementation mechanism. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">It is theoretically possible that we could determine that an agreement is “effec-tively verifiable” even when its degree of verifiability is quite low, because the parties have a strong track record of compliance, the risks associated with noncompliance are low, and/or the ease of detection and response is high. Similarly, there could be agreements that do not have a sufficient degree of verifiability to overcome concerns about the track record of other potential states party, the security risks of undetected cheating, and/or the difficulty, once cheating is detected, of responding on a timely ba-sis to deny a violator the benefits of its violation. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"> However, even with the most intrusive and extensive on-site inspections, a key question remains: what would one look for to verify intent? How could one construct an inspection regime that would provide definitive information on whether activities and items visited or observed were to be used for hostile purposes or were explicitly deployed for prohibited hostile purposes? It is not even necessary to consider how ex-ceedingly difficult this task would be, were a state intent on cheating. This is an ex-ceedingly difficult task in any event, given the dual-use nature of many space assets and activities. In the world of arms control, in the absence of definitive information, it is exceedingly difficult -- indeed, many would argue, virtually impossible -- to reach ac-tionable conclusions in a timely fashion. I mentioned earlier that most space arms control proposals have permitted re-search and development into the very kind of activities whose deployment would be banned. The breakout potential for permitted R&amp;D to support banned deployment ac-tivities is obvious. However, it also is worth noting that verifying the fact of research and development and the purposes for which R&amp;D were undertaken also present huge challenges, particularly if that R&amp;D has few, if any, external signatures, such as a test. A very real concern, even when indications or evidence of R&amp;D can be acquired, is whether sharing that information would expose sensitive sources and methods. Even if that hurdle could be crossed, given the dual-use nature of these technologies, confirm-ing that such activity is acquired or developed to support a banned program is highly problematic – especially in closed societies. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Chinese leaders believe domestic foes, their foreign backers and Western governments are scheming to undermine and ultimately topple the Communist Party. Recent speeches and articles from security officials echo with warnings of subversive plots backed by Western &quot;anti-China&quot; forces. Shortly before China's clampdown ramped up in February, a senior domestic security official, Chen Jiping, warned that &quot;hostile Western forces&quot; -- alarmed by the country's rise -- were marshalling human rights issues to attack Party control. Many of those that police interrogators quizzed Liu about were already detained in the crackdown that gained momentum in February. They included the detained artist Ai Teng Biao, a well-known rights lawyer, and Wen Tao, a reporter who is a friend and helper to Ai, said Liu. &quot;They also asked a little about Ai Weiwei and showed me a picture of him from a party,&quot; he said. &quot;I told them I didn't know anything about any of them.&quot; Officials have said Ai faces investigation for &quot;suspected economic crimes.&quot; But his sister, Gao Ge, dismissed that as a ruse and said Ai was detained for his political advocacy. &quot;The police officer who led the searches of his workshop was from state security. That says a lot,&quot; said Gao. &quot;If this is just an ordinary investigation, why haven't we heard from Ai Weiwei?&quot; HISTORY LESSONS China's government does indeed confront discontented citizens and groups who want to end one-party rule, and the United States and its allies make no secret that they want China to evolve into a liberal democracy. But what outsiders may see as a loose, disparate group of dissidents, bloggers, lawyers, and grassroots agitators, China's security police treat as a subversive, Western-backed coalition with the potential to erupt into outright opposition. &quot;(In China) there's a tendency to look for the 'black hand' and to look for an organization,&quot; said Joshua Rosenzweig, a Hong Kong-based researcher for the Dui Hua Foundation, a U.S. group that works for better treatment and the release of Chinese political prisoners. &quot;Their mentality is still based on the conspiracy of the revolutionary cell,&quot; Rosenzweig said in a telephone interview. &quot;The idea of a counter-revolutionary clique has never really gone away in China.&quot; The Party's alarm about domestic threats inspired by the anti-authoritarian uprisings across the Middle East and north Africa grew after an overseas Chinese website, Boxun.com, publicized calls for peaceful protests across China emulating the &quot;Jasmine Revolution.&quot; That fear has deep historical roots. In official eyes, the pro-democracy protests against the Party in 1989 were the doing of counter-revolutionary agitators backed by the United States and other Western powers. More recently, said two sources in Beijing, officials circulated documents claiming to show a Western conspiracy was behind the award of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, a veteran of the 1989 protests. Those sources spoke on condition on anonymity. &quot;It's not just a general sense that the Western governments supported the Nobel decision; it's a real belief that it was dreamed up in Washington as a way to attack China,&quot; said one of those sources, a researcher. INTERNET POWER Official Chinese fears of Western-backed subversion have been reinforced by the view that &quot;color revolutions&quot; that swept Central Asia several years ago were Western-promoted rehearsals for a similar subversive assault on China. Chen, the security official, was a senior producer of a documentary shown to officials several years ago to stress the threat of Western-backed &quot;color revolution&quot; subversion. The call for a &quot;Jasmine Revolution&quot; in particular brings together two of the Communist Party's great fears: Western-backed opposition and the power of the Internet to influence and possibly mobilize China's 453 million users. &quot;What's been going on in north Africa and the Middle East is a prime example in some people's eyes of the color revolution,&quot; said Rosenzweig, the Hong Kong-based rights researcher. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Defense News 8 [ “Experts: Deterrence Won't Protect U.S. Satellites - Defense News” By william matthews Published: 13 Nov 17] <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1307:http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3820260&amp;c=AME&amp;s=AIR --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3820260&amp;c=AME&amp;s=AIR" rel="nofollow">http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3820260&amp;c=AME&amp;s=AIR</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1307 --></span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">In the past two years, two satellites have been shot down - one by China, another by the U.S. - and at least one U.S. satellite has been dazzled by a Chinese laser. Yet the U.S. military has taken few steps to shield its satellites from disruption or destruction, said John Sheldon, a professor at the U.S. Air Force's School of Advanced Air and Space Studies. Rather than physical protection, Pentagon policymakers are hoping deterrence will safeguard their satellites, said Robert Butterworth, president of Aries Analytics, a space research firm. The problem is, for space systems, deterrence might not work. To deter attacks, the U.S. must be able to make credible threats of retaliation. But in space, U.S. options are limited, Butterworth said. For instance, the U.S. gains little leverage if it threatens to retaliate in kind - that is, to shoot down an enemy's satellite if the enemy shoots down an American spacecraft. Threatening to do so &quot;would give the advantage to the attacker,&quot; Butterworth said. Since the U.S. is much more reliant on space than any of its adversaries, shooting down a U.S. satellite would do far greater damage to the U.S. than shooting down an enemy satellite would do to the enemy, he said. Deterrence is made more difficult because it can be hard to tell who is responsible for some kinds of attacks on satellites, such as electronic jamming, Butterworth said. If there is trouble with a satellite, U.S. operators may not be able to tell whether it was caused by Venezuela, Indonesia or China, he said. It may even be difficult to tell whether a satellite has been attacked or has failed for other reasons. Threatening to strike &quot;counter-value targets&quot; could have some deterrent value, Sheldon said. To do that, the U.S. would have to identify targets that each adversary values and determine how to attack them should that adversary attack U.S. satellites. But it would be better for the U.S. to actively defend its satellites than to count on deterrence to protect them, the pair said during an address sponsored by the Marshall Institute in Washington. Satellites should be hardened to protect against electromagnetic pulses and be made more resistant to jamming, Sheldon said. The U.S. military also should speed up efforts such as the Operationally Responsive Space program to develop the ability to quickly launch satellites to replace those that have been lost. In addition to developing new launch systems, the military should build a supply of spare satellites to be launched when needed, he said. Space situational awareness programs should be made a higher priority. It is &quot;severely lacking today,&quot; Sheldon said. Better situational awareness would tell commanders whether a satellite has been attacked or struck by space junk. And it could help determine the origin of attacks. Integrating U.S. satellite capabilities with those of allies such as Germany, Italy and Britain is one way to increase redundancy and reduce the damage that could be done by attacking a U.S. satellite. But close cooperation with allies in space &quot;would require a substantial change in the secretive culture of the U.S. national security space community,&quot; Sheldon said. There is likely to be an even more daunting problem: cost. New, hardened satellites and new launch systems will cost tens of billions of dollars. But in the current financial crisis, &quot;protection of U.S. satellite systems may fall victim&quot; to budget cuts, Sheldon warned. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">Space situational awareness (SSA) is an essential prerequisite for carrying out the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) &quot;counterspace&quot; mission, which calls for protecting and exploiting one's own orbital assets, while negating an enemy's ability to do the same. For decades, SSA has relied on ground-based radar and electro-optical systems to detect, identify and track objects in orbit. The resulting data are compiled in a &quot;space catalog&quot; used by NASA, the Defense Dept. and commercial companies for myriad purposes, such as avoiding collisions between operational vehicles and space debris. &quot;In the past, we've been really good at counting what's up there and keeping track&quot; of objects in space, says Gen. Kevin P. Chilton, AFSPC commander. &quot;I maintain it's time to move beyond cataloging--to identify what's up there, understand its mission and, ultimately, determine its intent. I'm particularly focused on developing our [SSA],&quot; so combatant commanders can act on space-derived knowledge. For example, knowing when an enemy's communications and intelligence-gathering satellites are overhead would have a significant impact on a theater commander's combat-operations planning. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">I suggest that we prioritize space situational awareness programs in order to build as quickly as possible a comprehensive picture of the space environment, something that we are severely lacking today. If pol0icy makers and commanders possess the ability to differentiate between purposeful attacks and the hazards of the natural space environment, then the potential for misperception and miscalculation is dramatically reduced. Furthermore, effective deterrence is strengthened by the fact that space situational awareness could potentially indicate the nature and origins of any attempted attack on a satellite, something that would be very challenging given that there are many ways in which one can attack a satellite, including cyber.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The ISS is orbiting about 350 kilometers (220 miles) above Earth. Previously operated by three international crew members, it is now continuously occupied by a multinational crew of six. It is the largest human-made object ever to orbit the Earth. Fifteen countries are involved in the project, and all of the partners are contributing components to be integrated in orbit. The operations and management centers involved in the program are located in eleven countries and staffed by international teams. In 2008, the laboratory space and research facilities were tripled with the addition of the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Columbus module and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Kibo module joining NASA’s Destiny Laboratory, creating a research area about the size of three large buses. 1 Despite these accomplishments, the United States is currently planning to end its participation in the program in 2015, and the ISS is scheduled for a controlled de-orbit in 2016. International partners are interested in continuing the program but its fate is still uncertain. To understand why, it is useful to have an understanding of how the ISS program developed and how the current situation evolved.</span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">Although microbial life might survive the extreme conditions of space, for Homo sapien sapiens the space environment remains remarkably dangerous to life. One space life scientist, Vadim Rygalov, remarked that ensuring human life during spaceflight was largely about providing the basics of human physiological needs. From the most critical – meaning that its absence would cause immediate death, to the least critical – these include such constants available here on Earth of atmospheric pressure, breathable oxygen, temperature, drinking water, food, gravitational pull on physical systems, radiation mitigation, and others of a less immediate nature. As technologies, and knowledge about them, stand at this time, humans are able to venture into space for short periods of less than a year only by supplying all of these needs either by taking everything with them (oxygen, food, air, etc.) or creating them artificially (pressurized vehicles, centrifugal force to substitute for gravity, etc.).10 Spaceflight would be much easier if humans could go into hibernation during the extremes of spaceflight, as did the Streptococcus mitis bacteria. Resolving these issues has proven difficult but not insurmountable for such basic spaceflight activities as those undertaken during the heroic age of space exploration when the United States and the Soviet Union raced to the Moon. Overcoming the technological hurdles encountered during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs were child's play in comparison to the threat to human life posed by long duration, deep space missions to such places as Mars. Even the most sophisticated of those, the lunar landings of Project Apollo, were relatively short camping trips on an exceptionally close body in the solar system, and like many camping trips undertaken by Americans the astronauts took with them everything they would need to use while there. This approach will continue to work well until the destination is so far away that resupply from Earth becomes highly problematic if not impossible if the length of time to be gone is so great that resupply proves infeasible. There is no question that the U.S. could return to the Moon in a more dynamic and robust version of Apollo; it could also build a research station there and resupply it from Earth while rotating crews and resupplying from Earth on a regular basis. In this instance, the lunar research station might look something like a more sophisticated and difficult to support version of the Antarctic research stations. A difficult challenge, yes; but certainly it is something that could be accomplished with presently envisioned technologies.11 The real difficulty is that at the point a lunar research station becomes a colony profound changes to the manner in which humans interact with the environment beyond Earth must take place. Countermeasures for core challenges – gravity, radiation, particulates, and ancillary effects – provide serious challenges for humans engaged in space colonization (Figure 4). </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Why is sex so important? Aside from the obvious, space trips to other stars need hundreds of years to complete and the average life span of a human just doesn't cut it. We need generations of humans, a whole civilization of people to make that trip. And that means babies. And gravity. Yep, gravity! Of which there is none in space. That lack of gravity translates to weightlessness which is terrible for humans over a long period of time: it decreases our blood volume, atrophies our muscles, diminishes our bone mineral content and screws with our vision. But most terrible is that it makes it increasingly difficult to have sex. Biologist Athena Andreadis of the University of Massachusetts Medical School says: &quot;Sex is very difficult in zero gravity, apparently, because you have no traction and you keep bumping against the walls. Think about it: you have no friction, you have no resistance.&quot; Not only that, scientist have no idea what the repercussions of raising a child in gravity-less space would be. Would it disrupt embryonic development? Will the baby have weaker bones? Can you even have a baby? Seriously, giving birth is aided by gravity (mothers need the weight of the baby to push 'em out), without that gravity and weight, how would that happen? It's messy. </span><br />

Consider, for example, the first &quot;c:&quot; Is space becoming increasingly congested? The US government says publicly that there are some 17,000 things that are 10 centimeters or bigger and many more items that are smaller orbiting the earth. That's a lot, but those numbers say nothing about congestion. For travel purposes, I don't care how many cars there are in northern Virginia; I care how many are on the road at the same time and place as I. The relevant question is not congestion but whether the probability of collision is increasing, and at least one informal study suggests it has not changed over the past decade or so. That finding might be due in part to better information about the what/where/when of space objects; if so, it suggests that orbital conjunctions are already being managed successfully, due primarily to conjunction analyses and collision warnings provided by U.S. Strategic Command. As explained in a recent Time magazine article, the risk of accidents &quot;is minimized by the fact that all objects orbiting at the same altitude also move at the same speed.&quot; The Defense Department publication also mentions congestion in the electromagnetic spectrum, but there are longstanding measures to address both intentional and unintentional interference in this domain.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">While there are differences among national debris mitigation guidelines, they are broadly consistent. For example, all national guidelines address issues related to the minimization of debris released during normal operations. Most states require residual propellants, batteries, flywheels, pressure vessels, and other instruments to be depleted or made passive at the end of their operational lifetime.41 All major national debris mitigation guidelines address the disposal of GEO satellites, typically in graveyard orbits some 235 km above GEO, and most seek the removal of dead spacecraft from LEO within 25 years. 42 The Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of COPUOS began discussions of space debris issues in 1994 and published its Technical Report on Space Debris in 1999. In 2001 COPUOS asked IADC to develop a set of international debris mitigation guidelines, on which it based its own draft guidelines in 2005.43 In 2007 these guidelines were adopted by UN COPOUS and endorsed by the UN General Assembly as voluntary measures with which all states are asked to comply.44 The soon-to-be-released EU Code of Conduct also calls on signatories to reaffirm their commitments to the UN COPUOS space debris mitigation guidelines. The progressive development of international and national debris mitigation guidelines has been complemented by research on technologies to physically remove debris, such as electromagnetic “tethers” that could help to safely de-orbit non-operational satellites or debris.46 However, a 2006 IADC report concluded that, while “electrodynamic tethers have strong potential to become effective mitigation measures…various problems are still to be solved before this technique can be practically adopted.”47 Currently, natural decay due to atmospheric drag remains the only feasible way to remove debris, although research into this area continues. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">In response to the satellite collision discussed under Trend 1.1, the US House of Representatives Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics held a hearing on “Keeping the Space Environment Safe for Civil and Commercial Users” on 28 April.60 Experts from NASA, the US military, industry, academia, and NGOs provided testimony. According to subcommittee Chairwoman Gabrielle Giffords, the general conclusion of the hearing was that the problem is serious and the world needs to take concrete steps to address it.61 The US Air Force has drafted a new Space Safety Instruction, AFI-91-217, which outlines the safety and mishap prevention requirements for all existing and future US Air Force space systems.62 The Air Force Instruction (AFI) outlines specific requirements for launch, on-orbit, and atmospheric reentry operations, as well as system development, testing, and installation. In particular, the AFI outlines requirements for pre-launch and on-orbit collision avoidance screening and end-of-life actions. The fifth European Conference on Space Debris was held in Darmstadt, Germany in late March and early April.63 The conference brought together international experts in space debris to present new research. The main finding of the Conference was that debris mitigation – minimizing the creation of new debris from launching of satellites and operations in space – was not enough. The mass of debris that already exists in orbit is now at a critical level and will continue to grow through debris-on-debris collisions, even without additional launches. The active removal of debris from orbit – debris remediation – is necessary.64 In May the Institute of Air and Space Law at McGill University hosted an International Interdisciplinary Congress on Space Debris.65 The goal of the Congress was to examine a spectrum of potential measures to implement the debris mitigation guidelines developed by the IADC and accepted by the UN.66 These measures could include new legal regimes, economic incentives, national regulations, and voluntary agreements. The proposals from the Montreal meeting will be discussed at a second Congress in Cologne in May 2010, with findings published in 2010. In December 2009, NASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) jointly held the first International Conference on Orbital Debris Removal.67 The conference brought together government, academia, and the private sector to discuss the problem of actively removing space debris from orbit. Various technical solutions were presented, along with discussions on the related economic, legal, and policy challenges. Although some techniques have promise, none have been operationally proven and all have significant nontechnical and political challenges that need to be addressed.68 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The recent uptick in solar flares and other activity on the sun could one day cripple satellites or knock out power grids on Earth. But in the meantime, the solar maelstrom has been helping to clear out space junk, NASA scientists report. Right now some tens of millions of pieces of space junk are circling our planet—broken satellites, rocket parts, and other human-made materials trapped in orbit. That includes pieces from a Chinese probe that was destroyed during an anti-satellite missile test in 2007. In the latest issue of NASA's Orbital Debris Quarterly News, agency scientist Nicholas Johnson notes that an increased influx of solar heat is causing Earth's upper atmosphere—specifically, a layer known as the thermosphere—to swell. In turn, the puffed-up thermosphere has accelerated the rate at which the Chinese satellite debris is being removed from Earth's orbit, Johnson found. In general, &quot;the increase in solar activity causes more energy to be deposited into the atmosphere, which in turn is heated and expands,&quot; explained Johnson, chief scientist of NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. &quot;This increases atmospheric density at a given altitude, thereby increasing drag. This causes [orbiting space junk] to lose energy and fall into a lower orbit,&quot; where the debris eventually reenters the atmosphere, Johnson said in an email. In 2007 China deliberately destroyed its Fengyun-1C weather satellite to test anti-satellite technology. NASA estimates that about 6 percent of the 3,218 cataloged pieces of debris from Fengyun-1C have since reentered Earth's atmosphere. Half of those objects were destroyed during the past year alone, which coincides neatly with a ramp up in the sun's activity as it enters the next anticipated solar maximum—when solar activity is at its peak—in 2013. In total, more than a hundred metric tons of space junk have been destroyed in the past year. The majority of this debris would have reentered the atmosphere sooner or later—increased solar activity simply sped up the process, Johnson said. &quot;The more susceptible objects will fall out first, similar to flushing leaves from your house gutters,&quot; he said. While most of the objects that fall from they sky are vaporized before they hit the ground, some pieces are large enough that they could survive reentry and pose threats. &quot;Last year,&quot; Johnson said, &quot;there were 17 spacecraft and 8 rocket bodies which reentered in an uncontrolled manner, including two spacecraft and one rocket body from the 1960s.&quot; Johnson predicts that the sun's effect on the thermosphere will last through next year's solar max, but that the atmospheric swelling—and thus the space-junk purge—will begin to decrease soon after that.</span><br />

 Don’t evaluate their authors- the status quo is sufficient, anyone saying otherwise just wants to increase their funding<br />
BENNETT 2010 (James, Prof of Economics at George Mason, The Doomsday Lobby: Hype and Panic from Sputniks, Martians, and Marauding Meteors, p. 166<br />
<br />
The authors conclude that “increasing public awareness” may be the key to “demands… for action to deal with the impact hazard.” And so for the fifteen years since the Gehrels volume was published, those who seek public funds to deal with this rather hazy “hazard” have done their best to raise public awareness through various means.85 Curiously, a bracing shot of skeptical clarity appeared in the toebreakinglyif-you-drop-it long Hazards Due to Comets &amp; Asteroids on page 1203, which one seriously doubts one in a hundred readers ever make it to. P.R. Weissman of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory writes: “One problem for those advocating an impact hazard defense and/or detection system is that their recommendations often appear to be self-serving. Astronomers who study small bodies have advocated an observing program that emphasizes searching for large (&gt; 1 kilometer) Earth-crossing asteroids and comets… . These are, in general, the same objects that those astronomers are currently discovering with their existing search programs. Thus, their recommendations can be viewed as motivated by a desire to obtain additional funding and instrumentation for their ongoing work.”86 What a world of wisdom and insight is contained in those sentences! Astronomers and engineers whose livelihoods depend on the perception of an impact hazard develop and publish studies concluding that there is an impact hazard. The circle goes round and round, and fills, gradually, with taxpayer money. The lessons of Chicken Little, suggests Weissman, are one factor that has kept the funding of such programs from really taking off. Weissman urges his colleagues to “GO SLOW.” Don’t “attempt to divert substantial resources” to a program that, at present, is “neither necessary, nor prudent.”87<br />

Asteroid threats are exaggerated to get money for space programs<br />

<br />
That same volume contained a paper by Andrew F. Cheng and Robert W. Farquhar of the Applied Physics Laboratory, J. Veverka of Cornell University, and C. Pilcher of NASA arguing for space missions to NEOs in order to better determine their composition and structure.90 Going them one better were a sextet of researchers from NASA, the Russian Space Agency, and other institutions who wrote of manned exploration of NEOs, which would, among other things, “strengthen the integrity of any foreseeable program of human lunar and Mars exploration.”91 The NEO scare has many spinoffs, it seems: its missions can be even shake-down cruises for that long-delayed manned mission to Mars. The challenges of dealing with microgravity and cosmic rays, designing effective life support, and ensuring communications across the void of space would be rehearsed in manned NEO missions in preparation for a trip to Mars. Political scientist John Mueller, author of Overblown: How Politicians and the Terrorism Industry Inflate National Security Threats, and Why We Believe Them (2006), quotes a Turkish proverb — “If your enemy be an ant, imagine him to be an elephant” — which he describes as “spectacularly bad advice.”92 To drastically misestimate your enemy is to badly misallocate resources. For instance, the Department of Homeland Security announces, “Today’s terrorists can strike at any place, at any time, and with virtually any weapon.”93 This language, preposterously untrue — can terrorists really strike in Baton Rouge with an antimatter gun, or in Yankton, South Dakota, with a secret decoder ring? — could easily be transferred into any scare-mongering story about killer comets or rogue asteroids threatening the earth. Carl Sagan said that the extraordinarily remote chance that an asteroid or comet might strike Earth justified — indeed, compelled — a vigorous space program. “Since, in the long run, every planetary society will be endangered by impacts from space, every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring — not because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying alive.”94 Now, given that a K–T like disaster is expected every 50 or 100 million years, we might be excused for asking just how imperative it is that our government lead us into the brave new world of “spacefaring.” To ask this question, however, is to reveal oneself as unimaginative, dull, lacking in foresight, perhaps troglodytic, certainly far from au courant. This is asteroid alarmism as a trick shot, as a bulked-up NEO-detection program leads to an enhanced manned space travel program. Just as “professors learned to hustle in the regime of largesse after Sputnik,” in Walter A. McDougall’s phrase, so did they prove fast on their feet in tracking down killer asteroid funds.95 Warning, in grave sepulchral tones, about the end of the world does tend to concentrate the attention of the listener. And if the Cassandra giving the warning has a Ph.D. after her name, all the better. Surely no doctor of philosophy would exaggerate in order to have a pet project funded! The press does its part, as it always has. Sensationalism sells, and if it isn’t exactly grounded in truth, well, wink wink, everyone knows you can’t always believe what you read or hear.<br />

<em>NASA has an NEO contingency notification plan to be utilized in the very un¬likely event an object is detected with significant probability of impacting the Earth. The plan establishes procedures between the detection sites, the Minor Planet Cen¬ter, the NASA NEO Program Office at JPL, and NASA Headquarters to first quickly verify and validate the data and orbit on the object of interest, and then up-channel confirmed information in a timely manner to the NASA Administrator. These proce¬dures were first exercised with the discovery of the object now known as Apophis, which was found in December 2004 in a hazardous orbit but determined to not have a significant probability of impacting the Earth in the near-term.

Recognizing that impacts from near-Earth objects represent a hazard to humanity, the United States, the European Union. Japan, and other countries cooperatively organized to identify, track, and study NEOs in an effort termed &quot;Spaceguard.&quot; From this organization, a nonprofit group named the Spaceguard Foundation was created to coordinate NEO detection and studies: it is currently located at the European Space Agency's (ESA's) Centre for Earth Observation (ESRIN) in Frascati. Italy. The United States input to this collective effort comprises three aspects: telescopic search efforts to find NEOs, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and the NASA NEO Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Existing, retired, and proposed telescopic systems for the U.S. NEO searches are detailed below. Other telescopic survey, detec¬tion, and characterization efforts are conducted worldwide and work synergistically with U.S. telescopic searches (e.g.. Asiago-DLR Asteroid Survey, jointly operated by the University of Padua and the German Aerospace Center [DLR|. Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Object Survey at Rome Observatory; and the Bisei Spaceguard Center of the Japanese Spaceguard Association). To date, the U.S. search effort has been the major contributor to the number of known NEOs. The functions of the two U.S. data- and information-gathering offices, the MPC and the NEO Program Office, are complementary. A European data- and information-gathering office, the Near-Earth Objects Dynamic Site (NEODyS) is maintained at the University of Pisa in Italy, with a mirror site at the University of Valladolid in Spain. These three services are described below.<br />

Like its Hawaiian rival, this expensive project has broad scientific objectives, asteroid detection among them. Construction of LSST is expected to begin at Cerro Pachon, Chile in 2011 and be operational by 2014. When completed LSST will cover the entire available sky every four nights with a 3.2 billion pixel camera. 7 By 2000 more than 1,272 NEOs had been identified. By 2007 the number had grown to 5,083. And after ten years of operation LSST should have plotted rough orbits for 82% of 20,000 NEOs larger than 140 meters. In 2005 the U.S. Congress ordered NASA to expand its search to detect 90% of NEOs at least 140 meters in diameter by 2020. A byproduct of this activity will be the discovery of a large number of NEOs, some with the worrisome probability of striking Earth.<br />

Most of the experts define de-alerting as implementing some reversible physical changes in a weapon system that would significantly increase time between the decision to use the weapon and the actual moment of its launch. The proponents of this concept consider it as one of the ways to maintain strategic stability. They provide the following arguments in support of this concept. Radical changes have occurred in US-Russian relations. Russia and the United States are building strategic partnership relationship. In such situation the high alert readiness of strategic offensive forces targeted at each other does not correspond to the character of our relations. Strategic nuclear forces high alert readiness in combination with a concept of launch-on-warning strike increases the risk of “accidental” nuclear war (as a result of mistakes in the C3I system, inadequate situation analysis, mistaken decision-making, unauthorized action of personnel or even terrorists, provocation from the “third” states or non-state actors, etc.); False signals about missile attacks obtained from early warning system that may trigger an accidental launch. This assumption was very popular when the Russian early warning system was weakened as a result of collapse of the Soviet Union. Analysis of the above arguments shows, that they do not have solid grounds. Today Russian and U.S. ICBMs are not targeted at any state. High alert status of the Russian and U.S. strategic nuclear forces has not been an obstacle for building a strategic partnership. The issue of the possibility of an “accidental” nuclear war itself is hypothetical. Both states have developed and implemented constructive organizational and technical measures that practically exclude launches resulting from unauthorized action of personnel or terrorists. Nuclear weapons are maintained under very strict system of control that excludes any accidental or unauthorized use and guarantees that these weapons can only be used provided that there is an appropriate authorization by the national leadership. Besides that it should be mentioned that even the Soviet Union and the United States had taken important bilateral steps toward decreasing the risk of accidental nuclear conflict. Direct emergency telephone “red line” has been established between the White House and the Kremlin in 1963. In 1971 the USSR and USA signed the Agreement on Measures to Reduce the Nuclear War Threat. This Agreement established the actions of each side in case of even a hypothetical accidental missile launch and it contains the requirements for the owner of the launched missile to deactivate and eliminate the missile. Both the Soviet Union and the United States have developed proper measures to observe the agreed requirements.<br />

The United States and Russia have also worked for years to improve communications, reduce misunderstandings, and develop ways to lessen the risk of inadvertent launch or other errors in their strategic relationship. Most readers will be familiar with the Direct Communications Link (the famous “hotline”) established in 1963.27 In 1971, however, Washington and Moscow also signed an agreement establishing basic procedures to increase mutual consultation and notification regarding relatively innocent but potentially alarming activities – thereby reducing the risk of accidental nuclear war.28 Since 1987, the two parties have also operated securely- linked 24-hour communications centers – the U.S. node of which is the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center (NRRC) operated by the State Department29 – which specialize in transmitting such things as the notifications required under arms control treaties. Pursuant to a 1988 memorandum, NRRC transmittals, which go directly to the Russian Ministry of Defense, include ballistic missile launch notifications. This link also proved useful to help prevent strategic tensions after the terrorist assault of September 11, 2001 – at which point U.S. officials used the NRRC to reassure their Russian counterparts that the sudden American security alert in the wake of the Manhattan and Pentagon attacks was not in any way an indication of impending U.S. belligerence vis-à-vis Russia.<br />

If the survival of nuclear weapons requires their dispersal and concealment, do not problems of command and control become harder to solve? Americans think so because we think in terms of large nuclear arsenals. Small nuclear powers will neither have them nor need them. Lesser nuclear states might deploy, say, ten real weapons and ten dummies, while permitting other countries to infer that the numbers are larger. The adversary need only believe that some warheads may survive his attack and be visited on him. That belief should not be hard to create without making command and control unreliable. All nuclear countries must live through a time when their forces are crudely designed. All countries have so far been able to control them. Relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. and later among the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, were at their bitterest just when their nuclear forces were in early stages of development, were unbalanced, were crude and presumably hard to control. Why should we expect new nuclear states to experience greater difficulties than the old ones were able to cope with? Moreover, although some of the new nuclear states may be economically and technically backward, they will either have an expert and highly trained group of scientists and engineers or they will not produce nuclear weapons. Even if they buy the weapons, they will have to hire technicians to maintain and control them. We do not have to wonder whether they will take good care of their weapons. They have every incentive to do so. They will not want to risk retaliation because one or more of their warheads accidentally strikes another country.<br />

No accidental launch and no retaliation- failsafe systems<br />
Slocombe, 2009 (Walter B., Former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, “De-Altering: Diagnoses, Prescriptions, and Side Effects”, Discussion Paper Presented at the Seminar on Reframing De-Alert: Decreasing the Operational Readiness of Nuclear Weapon Systems in the U.S.-Russia Context, East-West Institute, June,<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1321:http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Slocombe.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Slocombe.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Slocombe.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1321 -->)<br />
<br />
Let’s start with Technical Failure – the focus of a great deal of the advocacy, or at least of stress on past incidents of failures of safety and control mechanisms.Much of the “de-alerting” literature points to a succession of failures to follow proper procedures and draw from that history the inference that a relatively simple procedural failure could produce a nuclear detonation. The argument is essentially that nuclear weapons systems are sufficiently susceptible of pure accident (including human error or failure at operational/field level) that it is essential to take measures that have the effect of making it necessary to undertake a prolonged reconfiguration of the elements of the nuclear weapons force for a launch or detonation to be physically possible. Specific measures said to serve this objective include separating the weapons from their launchers, burying silo doors, removal of fuzing or launching mechanisms, deliberate avoidance of maintenance measures need to permit rapid firing, and the like. . My view is that this line of action is unnecessary in its own terms and highly problematic from the point of view of other aspects of the problem and that there is a far better option that is largely already in place, at least in the US force – the requirement of external information – a code not held by the operators -- to arm the weapons. Advocates of other, more “physical,” measures often describe the current arrangement as nuclear weapons being on a “hair trigger.” That is – at least with respect to US weapons – a highly misleading characterization. The “hair trigger” figure of speech confuses “alert” status – readiness to act quickly on orders -- with susceptibility to inadvertent action. The “hair trigger” image implies that a minor mistake – akin to jostling a gun – will fire the weapon. The US StratCom commander had a more accurate metaphor when he recently said that US nuclear weapons are less a pistol with a hair trigger than like a pistol in a holster with the safety turned on – and he might have added that in the case of nuclear weapons the “safety” is locked in place by a combination lock that can only be opened and firing made possible if the soldier carrying the pistol receives a message from his chain of command giving him the combination. Whatever other problems the current nuclear posture of the US nuclear force may present, it cannot reasonably be said to be on a “hair trigger.” Since the 1960s the US has taken a series of measures to insure that US nuclear weapons cannot be detonated without the receipt of both external information and properly authenticated authorization to use that information. These devices – generically Permissive Action Links or “PALs” – are in effect combination locks that keep the weapons locked and incapable of detonation unless and until the weapons’ firing mechanisms have been unlocked following receipt of a series of numbers communicated to the operators from higher authority. Equally important in the context of a military organization, launch of nuclear weapons (including insertion of the combinations) is permitted only where properly authorized by an authenticated order. This combination of reliance on discipline and procedure and on receipt of an unlocking code not held by the military personnel in charge of the launch operation is designed to insure that the system is “fail safe,” i.e., that whatever mistakes occur, the result will not be a nuclear explosion. Moreover, in recent years, both the US and Russia, as well as Britain and China, have modified their procedures so that even if a nuclear-armed missile were launched, it would go not to a “real” target in another country but – at least in the US 5case - to empty ocean. In addition to the basic advantage of insuring against a nuclear detonation in a populated area, the fact that a missile launched in error would be on flight path that diverged from a plausible attacking trajectory should be detectable by either the US or the Russian warning systems, reducing the possibility of the accident being perceived as a deliberate attack. De-targeting, therefore, provides a significant protection against technical error.5 These arrangements – PALs and their equivalents coupled with continued observance of the agreement made in the mid-90s on “de-targeting” – do not eliminate the possibility of technical or operator-level failures, but they come very close to providing absolute assurance that such errors cannot lead to a nuclear explosion or be interpreted as the start of a deliberate nuclear attack.6 The advantage of such requirements for external information to activate weapons is of course that the weapons remain available for authorized use but not susceptible of appropriation or mistaken use. The drawback from a deterrence and operational point of view is, of course, that the system for transmitting the information must not be susceptible of interruption – that is, there must be assurance that an authorized decision maker will be able to act and have the decision – and the accompanying authenticated orders and unlock combinations – communicated to and received by the operators of the weapon systems. Accordingly, a system of combination-locked safeties requires a highly survivable network for decision and communication with the operators. Otherwise there would be pressures for early transmission of the codes, with their insertion subject to a later execute order or even more dangerous, pre-delegation of authority to issue the execute orders. In this, as in other aspects of measures to meet the “never” requirement, a highly capable and highly survivable command and control system is essential.<br />
