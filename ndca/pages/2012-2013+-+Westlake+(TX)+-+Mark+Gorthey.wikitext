I am personally opposed to disclosure, but by no means am in favor of hoarding academic knowledge, so if you would like any cites you've seen me read in round, email me at mgorthey@gmail.com and I'd be happy to send them! Pictures of small animals are also an option, cats are generally my speciality.

...loljk you can just check LD Leaks. But I've been reading different stuff since then, so just ask for whatever I've been reading recently, and I'll point you to where to find it!
