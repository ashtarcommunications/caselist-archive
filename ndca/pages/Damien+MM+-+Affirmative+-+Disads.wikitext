==2AC - Weaponization== 
Even if we get perceived microsats spur peace race--solves miscalc and escalation

To conclude, <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">small satellites have</span> <span class="Cards">... both civil and military</span>.

Empirics proves weaponization won’t escalate and can base cooperation

==2AC - Debris== 
Debris is inevitable in nature and human prevention fails

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Dangerous space debris i... decided to make a statement</span>.

Even if there WAS debris we could track and avoid it—plan is key

Intentionally destroying a satellite <span class="Cards">... which would </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">probably be large enough to be trackable</span>. 186

Their ev is just rhetoric to undermine U.S. leadership—prioritize our impacts since non-weapon activities still produce debris

==2AC - Launches== 
Space launches don’t disrupt the ozone

==2AC - Spending== 
Spending is a mess—fiscal discipline is just rhetoric and the economy is failing now

No Link - Microsats are cheaper to make and launch

The DOD has the power to take money from anyone and no one would find out where those funds were put into and even if they did the CIA would deter them from pursuing the issue
