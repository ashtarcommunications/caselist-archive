3) Cites for case defense will be up soon.

=Affirmative= 

==DTN 1AC== 

**Plan text:** The United States federal government should substantially increase the deployment of disruption/delay tolerant networking on its satellites, including but not limited to space based network nodes.

**Contention 1**

**US space systems are vulnerable – our military is dependent and multiple state and non state actors will attack.**
**Denmark, 10** - Fellow with the Center for a New American Security [By Abraham M. and Dr. James Mulvenon CNAS, Jan, Contested Commons: The Future of American Power in a Multipolar World [[http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS%20Contested]] %20Commons%20Capstone_0.pdf]

In an environment where all the stray bullets… a kind of terrorism in zero gravity.

**Scenario 1 is cyberattacks:**

**a) Liklihood of a cyberattack is increasing.**
**Ginter, 7** – Lieutenant Colonel, US army (2/22, Karl, “Space Technology and Network Centric Warfare: A Strategic Paradox,” USAWC Strategy Research Project, pdf)

The cyber threat to DoD computer networks is real… where critical computer nodes are unprotected.


**b) Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are uniquely vulnerable**
**Gable, 9** - Adjunct Professor of Public International Law, Drexel University Earle Mack School of Law (8/16, Kelly A., “Cyber-Apocalypse Now: Securing the Internet Against Cyberterrorism and Using Universal Jurisdiction as a Deterrent,” Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law, Volume 43:57, pdf)

The primary insecurity of the TCP/IP Protocol is that… Internet may not be as safe as originally thought.


**c) Status quo defense are inadequate**
**Mirza 9/1** - political-military analyst for the Hudson Institute (2011, Hassan, “Cyber-Attacks Are the Biggest National Security Threat,” [[http://www.policymic.com/article/show?id=1519&response=true]])

Appearing before the [[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/13/panetta-cyberattack-next-pearl-harbor_n_875889.html|Senate Armed Services Committee]] in June… U.S. Central Command, which oversees the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

**Scenario 2 is ground attacks:**

**a) Impossible to protect all ground stations.**
**Ginter, 7** – (3/30/07, Lieutenant Colonel Karl Ginter, United States Army, “Space Technology and Network Centric Warfare: a Strategic Paradox”)

Ground segment attack or sabotage to disrupt space assets… reconstitution in the event of ground system or power failures.

**b) Commercial stations are vulnerable**
**SSI, 10** – Space Security Index published by a group of aerospace experts at [[@http://spacesecurity.org/|spacesecurity.org]] (August 2010, Governance Group and Advisory Group, “Space Security 2010”, [[@http://spacesecurity.org/|spacesecurity.org]],[[@http://www.spacesecurity.org/space.security.2010.reduced.pdf]])

Satellite ground stations and communications links are the most… the general boundaries of their relative military capabilities.


**Downlink jamming kills satellites too.**
**Ginter, 7** – Lieutenant Colonel, US army (2/22, Karl, “Space Technology and Network Centric Warfare: A Strategic Paradox,” USAWC Strategy Research Project, pdf)

Downlink jamming can affect communications links as… employ in an attempt to neutralize U.S. space-based assets.



**These attacks destroy hegemony**
**Marshall, 8** - NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science)

Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of… this is a topic that could benefit from further research.


**Heg is good**

**Zhang and Shi, 1/22** – 11 – *Yuhan Zhang is a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, D.C.; Lin Shi is from Columbia University. She also serves as an independent consultant for the Eurasia Group and a consultant for the World Bank in Washington, D.C. (America’s decline: A harbinger of conflict and rivalry, [[@http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/01/22/americas-decline-a-harbinger-of-conflict-and-rivalry/]])

This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline… will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy


**Contention 2**

**Drones are the only game in town in Pakistan – making them successful is key to keeping down the insurgency.**
**Bergen and Tiedemann 11** – (July/Aug. 2011, Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann, “Washington’s Phantom War,” Foreign Affairs, [[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67939/peter-bergen-and-katherine-tiedemann/washingtons-phantom-war?page=show]] DH)

Despite the drone program's shortcomings, it… once said, the drone program is "the only game in town."

**But drone inaccuracy is the single biggest reason for failure – causes MORE terrorists not less in the squo.**
**Bergen and Tiedemann 11** – (July/Aug. 2011, Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann, “Washington’s Phantom War,” Foreign Affairs, [[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67939/peter-bergen-and-katherine-tiedemann/washingtons-phantom-war?page=show]] DH)

What is clear is that the drone strikes have not deterred… carry out suicide attacks in Afghanistan come from these regions.

**Growing insurgency in Pakistan causes terrorism, state collapse, and global nuclear war.**
**Pitt 09** – a New York Times and internationally bestselling author of two books: "War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn't Want You to Know" and "The Greatest Sedition Is Silence." (5/8/09, William, “Unstable Pakistan Threatens the World,” [[http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=commentary&article=2183]])

But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with… appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all.

**In addition, terror happens in Somalia and Yemen**
**Reuters, 11** (7/15, “As US wars wind down, drones gain new prominence,” http://www.dawn.com/2011/07/15/as-us-wars-wind-down-drones-gain-new-prominence.html)

Missile-armed drones are playing a greater role than ever… effective and better focused way" of using military force against militants.

**Nuclear terror means extinction**
**Morgan, 09** (Dennis, Professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (South Korea, “World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race,” Futures, November, Science Direct)

In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore… to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter.

**Resilient, high speed, low latency UAV links are key to make UAV’s successful.**
**Klassen 09** – (7/1/09, Tim, Owner/Engineering Design Services at SENT Inc, former Project Manager at GE Intelligent Platforms, former, Senior Engineer at SBS Technologies, former, Senior Engineer at Focus Automation Systems/Avvida Systems, “The UAV video problem: using streaming video with unmanned aerial vehicles,” [[http://www.militaryaerospace.com/index/display/article-display/365480/articles/military-aerospace-electronics/volume-20/issue-7/features/viewpoint/the-uav-video-problem-using-streaming-video-with-unmanned-aerial-vehicles.html]] DH)

Additionally, in unmanned air vehicles, the criticality level… Minimized overall latency

**This renders drones useless and multiplies mistakes and civilian casualties – we solve your ‘drones bad’ turns**
**Thompson, 11** – Chief Operating Officer at the Lexington Institute and Forbes contributor (8/29, Loren, “The Revolution In Unmanned Aircraft Is Overrated,” http://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2011/08/29/the-revolution-in-unmanned-aircraft-is-overrated/)

Third, unmanned aircraft aren’t really robotic… even if their endurance is considerably greater.


**Solvency**

**Space based network nodes solve satellite vulnerability, network strain, and high latency.**
**NSTAC 09** – (Nov. 2009, National Securtiy Telecommunications Advisory Committee, “NSTAC Report to the President on Commercial Satellite Communications Mission Assurance,” [[http://www.ncs.gov/nstac/reports/2009/NSTAC%20STF%20Report%20FINAL%2011302009.pdf]] DH)

The DoD is currently exploring the benefits of placing IP routers… network communications over a satellite.


**Delay Tolerant Networking radically improves the safety and speed of Airborne Networks – solves drones**
**Lee et al, 10** – Kevin C Lee, Adam Piechowicz, Mario Gerla: Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; Abhishek Tiwari, Anurag Ganguli: UtopiaCompression Corporation; David Krzysiak: Air Force Research Lab, rome Research Site (1/14, “Delay Tolerant Mobility Aware Routing/MobilityDissemination Protocol for the Airborne Network,” pdf)

Despite “airborne network (AN) topology design” and careful planning… signiﬁcantly higher than battery operated MANET nodes.


**DTN solves all network problems.**
**Jonson et al, 8** - Thomas Jonson, Jonah Pezeshki, Victor Chao, Kristofer Smith, James Fazio, Booz Allen Hamilton (5/8, IEEE, APPLICATION OF DELAY TOLERANT NETWORKING (DTN) IN AIRBORNE NETWORKS,” pdf)

The DTN architecture has been designed for networks… reducing network load and total transmission delay (Figure 5).

**Status quo solutions can’t solve – just interim capabilities that will inevitably collapse.**
**Jonson et al, 8** - Thomas Jonson, Jonah Pezeshki, Victor Chao, Kristofer Smith, James Fazio, Booz Allen Hamilton (5/8, IEEE, APPLICATION OF DELAY TOLERANT NETWORKING (DTN) IN AIRBORNE NETWORKS,” pdf)
COI = Community of Interest

Similar to other radio-based communications within the DoD… interoperability and intermittency in the AN environment, needs to be adopted.

**DTN is the only way to solve IP vulnerabilities.**
**Scott, 5** – MITRE corporation, not-for-profit technology firm (October, K., “Disruption tolerant networking proxies for on-the-move tactical networks,” Military Communications Conference, 3226-3231, IEEE Xplore)

Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) [3] defines a store- and-forward, message-switched… but decide to defer transmission of a bundle until an upcoming SATCOM pass.

Possession of satellites with both defensive… instability and tensions in bilateral relations.

**Limited warfare and escalation control don’t apply in space**
**Krepon, 03** – president of the Henry Stimson Center (Michael, Space Assurance or Space Dominance? THE CASE AGAINST WEAPONIZING SPACE, http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/spacebook.pdf)

**Bostrum, 02** – professor of philosophy at Oxford (March, Nick, “Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards,” Journal of Evolution and Technology, http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html)

A much greater existential risk emerged… that we will encounter in the 21st century.

**Kirkland 98** - (1996, Russell Kirkland, Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Cultures, specialist in Asian Religions, Associate Professor of Religion at UGA, "’RESPONSIBLE NON-ACTION’ IN A NATURAL WORLD : PERSPECTIVES FROM THE NEI-YEH, CHUANG-TZU, AND TAO-TE CHING" HARVARD CONFERENCE ON TAOISM AND ECOLOGY DH)

If we leave aside such self-serving… trustworthy tendencies of Heaven-and-Earth.

**Modern conceptions of agency presume that human actions have the potential to be good or bad – they ignore the presence of the Tao and the fact that human agency can only disrupt the natural course of the universe and bring horrific tragedy.**
**Kirkland 98** - (1996, Russell Kirkland, Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Cultures, specialist in Asian Religions, Associate Professor of Religion at UGA, "’RESPONSIBLE NON-ACTION’ IN A NATURAL WORLD : PERSPECTIVES FROM THE NEI-YEH, CHUANG-TZU, AND TAO-TE CHING" HARVARD CONFERENCE ON TAOISM AND ECOLOGY DH)

In all modern thought, as… throughout the entire process.

======AT: You’re Immoral====== 

**Modern morality makes the flawed assumption that we are the only beings at work in the world and that we have a responsibility to solve its problems – this ignores the workings of the Tao and can only lead to more suffering than it could possibly prevent.**
**Kirkland 98** - (1996, Russell Kirkland, Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Cultures, specialist in Asian Religions, Associate Professor of Religion at UGA, "’RESPONSIBLE NON-ACTION’ IN A NATURAL WORLD : PERSPECTIVES FROM THE NEI-YEH, CHUANG-TZU, AND TAO-TE CHING" HARVARD CONFERENCE ON TAOISM AND ECOLOGY DH)

So is the Taoist perspective on life… all living things, human and otherwise.




==Specific Rounds== 

===Greenhill RR vs. St. Mark's BB=== 

====T – Near Space==== 

=====1NC===== 

**The mesosphere is at an altitude of 30 to 50 miles**
**Jessey 2k** – Ph. D, professor of geology at CSU ( http://geology.csupomona.edu/drjessey/class/Gsc101/Moisture.html “ MOISTURE, CLOUDS and PRECIPITATION”)

Troposphere - lowest layer of the atmosphere… in effect no atmosphere present.

**Near space is below the mesosphere and is not in orbit.**
**Foust 10** – (11/15/10, Jeff, editor and publisher of The Space Review, “It’s time to pop the space balloon meme,” http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1726/1 DH)

The problem is not with the people… only goes to the “edge of space”.)

=====2NC – Mesosphere===== 

**The mesosphere is at an altitude of 21.1 to 49.7 miles**
**EPA 10** – Environmental protection agency (2010, “Atmosphere”, http://www.epa.gov/apti/course422/ap1.html)

The first layer is called the troposphere… together make up the upper atmosphere.

**The Mesosphere is the region of the atmosphere between 50 and 80km**
**Oxford Dictionary** – (http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mesosphere?view=uk)

The region of the earth's… 50 and 80 km in altitude.

=====2NC – Near Space===== 

**Not space – they MUST orbit because EVERYTHING ABOVE NEAR SPACE IS IN ORBIT**
**Knoedler, Air Command & Staff College, 5** – (Andrew, Major in the USAF, “Using Near Space Vehicles in the Pursuit of Persistent C3ISR,” 10th INTERNATIONAL COMMAND AND CONTROL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY SYMPOSIUM -- THE FUTURE OF C2)

Near space is not space… in a position of air dominance.

**Balloons only work in near space – they are definitionally a satellite.**
**Foust 10** – (11/15/10, Jeff, editor and publisher of The Space Review, “It’s time to pop the space balloon meme,” http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1726/1 DH)

The second problem with this… been nothing more than curiosities.)

**Media confusion is responsible**
**Foust 10** – (11/15/10, Jeff, editor and publisher of The Space Review, “It’s time to pop the space balloon meme,” http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1726/1 DH)

The problem is not with projects… only goes to the “edge of space”.)

**They’re wrong.**
**Foust 10** – (11/15/10, Jeff, editor and publisher of The Space Review, “It’s time to pop the space balloon meme,” http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1726/1 DH)

This could be dismissed as nothing… flown on amateurs’ balloon flights.

====Counterplan==== 

=====1NC===== 

**Being in orbit means they are non-responsive.**
**Tomme 05** (Ed, USAF Lieutenant Colonel and Ph.D. in physics, http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cadre/ari_2005-01.pdf, The Paradigm Shift to Effects-Based Space: Near-Space as a Combat Space Effects Enabler” DH)

Once on orbit, satellites are all… months of duration on station.

=====2NC===== 

**G forces and construction flaws**
**Tomme 05** (Ed, USAF Lieutenant Colonel and Ph.D. in physics, http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cadre/ari_2005-01.pdf, The Paradigm Shift to Effects-Based Space: Near-Space as a Combat Space Effects Enabler” DH)

When the cost variable is examined… elimination of space-hardening

**Turns case – the type of platforms their aff relies on can’t function in space and provide no benefits.**
**Tomme 05** (Ed, USAF Lieutenant Colonel and Ph.D. in physics, http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cadre/ari_2005-01.pdf, The Paradigm Shift to Effects-Based Space: Near-Space as a Combat Space Effects Enabler” DH)

Satellites obviously orbit much… seen in the accompanying table.

===Greenhill Round 4 vs. UC Lab RH=== 

====Orientalism==== 

=====Links/Framework===== 

**Academics studying the Arab world should reflect on their assumptions regarding the region – such analysis must precede political actions and predictions or risk serial policy failure.**
**Gause 11** – (2011, F. Gregory Gause III, PhD in Political Science, Harvard University, Professor of Political Science at the University of Vermont, “Why the Middle East Studies Missed the Arab Spring,” Foreign Affairs, July/August 2011, DH)

Academic specialists on Arab politics… best left to Arabs themselves.

**American attempts to write the history of the Arab Spring fail and reproduce Orientalist binaries, creating cyclical violence, re-intervention, and war.**
**McGill 11** [David, radiius, expanding sphere of concepts centred on the critical exploration of philosophical, political and social issues, “Breaking News From The ‘West’”]

The recent events that have captivated… continuously pulled over the eyes of the masses.

**Can’t predict the Arab spring or its results.**
**Taleb and Blyth, 11** - *Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering at New York University's Polytechnic Institute AND **Professor of International Political Economy at Brown University (Nassim and Mark, “The Black Swan of Cairo: How Suppressing Volatility Makes the World Less Predictable and More Dangerous,” Foreign Affairs, May/June, proquest)

Complex systems that have artificially… those of an artificially controlled price.

=====AT: Our Democracy is Good===== 

**Their author links – all about manipulating other governments for the good of the US.**
**Lynn-Jones 98** – Editor of the peer reviewed journal International Security and Series Editor of Belfer Center Studies in International Security. Sean M (//jh), March, “Why the United States Should Spread Democracy” discussion paper for Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/2830/why_the_united_states_should_spread_democracy.html//

//This paper argues that the United States… security and prosperity of the United States.//

//**Says that Iran is a democracy but liberal democracy is what is important.**//
//**Lynn-Jones 98** – Editor of the peer reviewed journal International Security and Series Editor of Belfer Center Studies in International Security. Sean M (//jh), March, “Why the United States Should Spread Democracy” discussion paper for Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/2830/why_the_united_states_should_spread_democracy.html

Democracy can be defined as a set of political… encouraging states to hold free and fair elections.

===St. Mark's Octos vs. Edina SS=== 

====Asteroids K==== 

=====1NC===== 

**The affirmative’s global approach to the asteroid threat erases societal distinctions and subordinates all other questions to the nature of the hazard itself.**
**Hewitt 07** – (2007, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Chapter 24: Social Perspectives on Comet/Asteroid Impact (CAI) Hazards: Technocratic Authority and the Geography of Social Vulnerability,” published in Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society, ed. Peter T. Bobrowsky and Hans Rickman, springerlink DH)

From a social perspective it is… with astrophysical and geophysical sciences.

**Specifically, their use of statistics to mitigate scientific uncertainty about asteroids cements a positivistic view of daily life.**
**Mellor 10** – (Felicity, PhD in theoretical physics, lecturer on media theory and science journalism at Imperial College in London, former lecturer in astronomy at Sussex University, “Negotiating uncertainty: asteroids, risk and the media,” Public Understanding of Science 2010 19: 16, sage DH)

Chapman and Morrison’s paper acknowledged… collected data on other causes of death.

**This turns individual people into objective units that can be calculated and manipulated.**
**Hewitt 95** – (1995, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Excluded Perspectives in the Social Construction of Disaster,” International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, November 1995, Vol.13, No.3, pp. 317-339, google scholar DH)

From a social perspective, a dubious… unstable-which seems to reverse Porfiriev's usage.

**The voiceless and universal nature of disaster discourse is a gateway to genocidal atrocity and dehumanization – their method and rhetoric matters.**
**Hewitt 95** – (1995, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Excluded Perspectives in the Social Construction of Disaster,” International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, November 1995, Vol.13, No.3, pp. 317-339, google scholar DH)

In recent years, studies of the societal underpinnings… communities, but to the voices of persons living there.

**The alternative is to reject the “agent-specific” approach of the 1AC in favor of a post-social understanding of disaster mitigation – only a broader methodological framing of hazards can break open the research field.**
**Williams 08** – (2008, Stewart, PhD, Lecturer in Geography and Environmental Studies, University of Tasmania, Australia, “Rethinking the Nature of Disaster: From Failed Instruments of Learning to a Post-Social Understanding,” Social Forces, Volume 87, Number 2, December 2008, muse DH)

Demands for new approaches to disaster… institutions, and society-environment interactions."

**Finally, in the context of disaster mitigation, the central question is not “what” but “why.” Understanding where our interests come from is a prior question to the actions we take.**
**Hewitt 95** – (1995, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Excluded Perspectives in the Social Construction of Disaster,” International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, November 1995, Vol.13, No.3, pp. 317-339, google scholar DH)

Most people working in this field… and centrally controlled administrative measures.


=====Links===== 

======Global Extinction====== 

**Placing sole emphasis on the global nature of asteroids ignores the variety of ways their impacts can be felt differently by those of different social and geographical location – small impacts and their after affects are comparatively as important.**
**Hewitt 07** – (2007, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Chapter 24: Social Perspectives on Comet/Asteroid Impact (CAI) Hazards: Technocratic Authority and the Geography of Social Vulnerability,” published in Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society, ed. Peter T. Bobrowsky and Hans Rickman, springerlink DH)

Until quite recently, research into comet… calamities seem the appropriate place to begin.

======Comparisons====== 

**The way the aff reaches their “extinction” conclusion is based on comparisons with other disasters, yet presumes a common social ground and ignores serious ethical concerns with this approach.**
**Hewitt 07** – (2007, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Chapter 24: Social Perspectives on Comet/Asteroid Impact (CAI) Hazards: Technocratic Authority and the Geography of Social Vulnerability,” published in Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society, ed. Peter T. Bobrowsky and Hans Rickman, springerlink DH)

Having chosen to concentrate on lesser… serious conceptual, technical and ethical questions.

=====Impacts===== 

======Structural Violence====== 

**The aff’s descriptions of disaster rely on an assumption of normality that does not exist for most of the world – they ignore everyday structural violence.**
**Hewitt 95** – (1995, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Excluded Perspectives in the Social Construction of Disaster,” International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, November 1995, Vol.13, No.3, pp. 317-339, google scholar DH)

Gilbert, who raises concerns close… global wanning, militarisation and so forth.

**Structural violence kills more people than all war combined – the alt can solve.**
**Hintjens 07** – (Helen Hintjens is Lecturer in the Centre for Development Studies, University of Wales, “MDF Understanding Development Better,” http://udb.global-connections.nl/sites/udb.global-connections.nl/files/file/2923317.051%20-%20Position%20Paper%20Helen%20Hintjens.pdf)

From Johan Galtung, famous Norwegian peace… is neither natural nor inevitable”, p. 301 (Prontzos).

======Turns Case====== 

**Turns case – they won’t be able to mobilize support for deflection even if their detection technology works**
**Hewitt 07** – (2007, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Chapter 24: Social Perspectives on Comet/Asteroid Impact (CAI) Hazards: Technocratic Authority and the Geography of Social Vulnerability,” published in Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society, ed. Peter T. Bobrowsky and Hans Rickman, springerlink DH)

Wider public support will also depend… findings and reflection on their significance (Beck 1992).

**Ignoring social vulnerability means that scientists won’t effectively be able to communicate risk to the public.**
**Hewitt 07** – (2007, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Chapter 24: Social Perspectives on Comet/Asteroid Impact (CAI) Hazards: Technocratic Authority and the Geography of Social Vulnerability,” published in Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society, ed. Peter T. Bobrowsky and Hans Rickman, springerlink DH)

Some recent developments in disaster… that starts with the communities at risk.

**Ignoring impact location turns their risk analysis and kills solvency.**
**Sidle 07** – (Roy, PhD, Professor of Geology, Appalachian State University, former member of the Disaster Prevention Research Institute of Kyoto University in Japan, elected an American Geophysical Union Fellow in 2010, “Chapter 23: Hazard Risk Assessment of a Near Earth Object,” published in Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society, ed. Peter T. Bobrowsky and Hans Rickman, springerlink DH)

Hazard risk assessment of NEO impacts… areas are targeted as potential impact sites.

=====Framework===== 

**Calculative thought makes extinction inevitable.**
**Dillon 99** – (Michael, professor of political science at the University of Lancaster, Political Theory, Vol. 27, No. 2 (Apr., 1999), pg 163- 164 jstor)

Otherness is born(e) within the self… lack constitutive of the human way of being.

**Only we have comparative evidence.**
**Hewitt 07** – (2007, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Chapter 24: Social Perspectives on Comet/Asteroid Impact (CAI) Hazards: Technocratic Authority and the Geography of Social Vulnerability,” published in Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society, ed. Peter T. Bobrowsky and Hans Rickman, springerlink DH)

These conclusions arose from experience… very distant dangers, however catastrophic.

**Serial policy failure – failure to understand the assumptions behind your method circumscribes the full range of policy actions available and precludes effective action.**
**Sayer, 92** – (1992, Andrew Sayer, PhD, Professor of Sociology at Lancaster University, “Method in Social Science,” pp. 1-2 DH)

The status of social science is… and that we need to reflect on it.

**And this is specifically key in the context of asteroids**
**Hewitt 07** – (2007, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Chapter 24: Social Perspectives on Comet/Asteroid Impact (CAI) Hazards: Technocratic Authority and the Geography of Social Vulnerability,” published in Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society, ed. Peter T. Bobrowsky and Hans Rickman, springerlink DH)

For such reasons, social scientists… groups who dominate its policies.

=====Answers===== 

======AT: Perm====== 

**The agent specific approach marginalizes sociological concerns – rejection is key.**
**Hewitt 95** – (1995, Kenneth, PhD in geomorphology from London University, professor emeritus of geography and environmental studies and Research Associate at the Cold Regions Research Center at Wilfrid Laurier University, research focuses on risk and disaster theory, “Excluded Perspectives in the Social Construction of Disaster,” International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, November 1995, Vol.13, No.3, pp. 317-339, google scholar DH)

A broad range of studies in the 1970s… justified and very timely concerns.

====Asteroids Good DA==== 

=====1NC===== 

__**First, asteroid strikes don’t cause total extinction:**__

**A) Empirically proven – extinction of the dinosaurs.**
**Boulter 05** – (2005, Michael, professor of paleobiology at the Natural History Museum and the University of East London, scientist with the Fossil Record 2, the world's largest database of fossil remains, “Extinction, Evolution, and the End of Man,” p. 89-90, DH)

Evidence now shows that the environmental… one another just after the event itself.

**B) Even extinction events much bigger than any asteroid ever didn’t kill all life – they’re piecemeal.**
**Boulter 05** – (2005, Michael, professor of paleobiology at the Natural History Museum and the University of East London, scientist with the Fossil Record 2, the world's largest database of fossil remains, “Extinction, Evolution, and the End of Man,” p. 60-2, DH)

As well as the meteorites colliding with the… orderly complexity of a Bach concerto.

**C) The ash and darkness caused by an asteorid is good for tons of plant life.**
**Boulter 05** – (2005, Michael, professor of paleobiology at the Natural History Museum and the University of East London, scientist with the Fossil Record 2, the world's largest database of fossil remains, “Extinction, Evolution, and the End of Man,” p. 92-4, DH)

Hundreds of thousands of pollen and… that the planet has ever experienced.

__**Second, asteroid strikes are good:**__

**A) Asteroid strikes are good fo biodiversity and evolution.**
**Grady 06** – (11/9/06, Monica, professor of planetary and space science at the Open University, UK, meteorite expert, interview with Astrobiology Magazine, “Meteorites: Friend or Foe?” [[http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/2139/meteorites-friend-or-foe]] DH)

AM: Plus, they’re our friends… mammals occurred at the K-T boundary.

**B) Empirically proven, the environment will adapt and grow more diverse in response to an asteroid impact.**
**Boulter 05** – (2005, Michael, professor of paleobiology at the Natural History Museum and the University of East London, scientist with the Fossil Record 2, the world's largest database of fossil remains, “Extinction, Evolution, and the End of Man,” p. 45-7, DH)

But suddenly, 65 million years ago… attendant dominant groups of competitors.

**C) Asteroids are beneficial for the development of life and the planet.**
**Chapman, aff author, 03** – (2/10/03, Clark, scientist at the Southwest Research Institute's Department of Space Studies, member of the MSI/NIS (imaging/spectrometer) team of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission to Eros, “Great Impact Debates: The Benefits of Hard Bodies,” [[http://www.astrobio.net/debate/373/the-benefits-of-hard-bodies]] DH)

Clark Chapman: Here I differ with… will happen during the present century.

===Glenbrooks Semis vs. HoFlo GS=== 

====Counterplan==== 

=====1NC===== 

**Counterplan Text:** The United States federal government should develop a military launch infrastructure that allows for launch on demand and reconstitution. The United States federal government should develop small satellite technology and maintain a complete reserve to enable replacement of all essential satellites. The United States federal government should independently fund the extension of federal unemployment benefits. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration should fully fund combined ground- and space-based survey measures for Near Earth Object detection.

**Reconstitution improvements mean we don’t need other satellite defenses.**
**Butterworth 08** – (11/13/08, Robert, PhD, professor of space and national security affairs at George Washington University, President of Aries Analytics, a company which pro-vides market analyses and program development services to government, commercial and non-profit clients concerning space and space-related research and development.

He was also responsible for the review and oversight activities, budget support and program analyses for selected space and intelligence activities, “Deterrence in Space: Responding to Challenges to the U.S. in Outer Space,” The George Marshall Institute, [[http://www.marshall.org/pdf/materials/622.pdf]] DH)

But we don’t have to worry… do actually starting this year.

**Combined space and ground based surveys solve asteroid detection – provides uniqueness for the DA.**
**NRC 10** – (National Research Council Committee to Review Near-Earth Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies, “Defending Planet Earth: Near-Earth Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies,” http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12842)

Butterworth: My response is that you… low-earth-orbit assets. Is that responsive?

**Rapid launch of small sats solve any loss of capability during a conflict.**
**Krepon and Clary 03** – (2003, Michael Krepon, co-founder of Stimson, and director of the South Asia and Space Security programs, author or editor of thirteen books, and more than 350 articles.
