<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">NCW is inevitable – it’s a question of effectiveness</span>

Now that the literature review is complete, it is possible to investigate the potential of NCW. This author has not found any proponents of NCW touting that this concept is the “Silver Bullet” to solve all the problems of future warfare. Many of the same problems that have plagued warfighters in the past exist today and will exist in the future: fog and friction, competing advances in technologies, the unpredictable nature of human behavior on the battlefield, and asymmetric warfare to name only a few. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The issue isn’t the existence of these challenges to modern warfare but how one exploits the advantages of information to mitigate risk and take advantage of strengths in the force to achieve objectives</span>. 35 Are the potential benefits of NCW worth the opportunity costs associated with aggressively moving forward with the implementation of this new concept? <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The concept of Network Centric Warfare has already moved beyond the “bumper sticker” stage. NCW is not a fad that will go quietly into the night. There is little doubt that DOD is spending significant finite resources to pursue NCW capabilities</span>. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">DOD costs in the area of military electronics, aircraft avionics, vetronics, and missile guidance, communications, electro-optics is approaching $99.57 billion in</span> the <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">2010</span>. 36 <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">There may be changes to terminology, shifts in policy, and alterations in implementation plans. However, the core concepts that relate to leveraging the power of information will remain.</span> The <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">DOD and senior military leaders have been consistent yet cautious in their support of a networked force.</span> Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld concisely stated the importance a fully networked force in the Transformation Planning Guidance, “<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">We must achieve: fundamentally joint, network-centric</span>, distributed <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">forces</span> capable of rapid decision superiority and massed effects across the operational environment. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Realizing these capabilities will require transforming our people, processes, and military forces.”</span> 37 ADM <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Giambastiani</span>, former Commander U.S. Joint Forces Command <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">stated</span>, “<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">A fully collaborative and networked force is an imperative, not a luxury.” </span>38 The former Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, General Michael Haggee said, “The capability to connect disparate units spread over the battlefield will help to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance to commanders who can then call in fire support…Information Technology (IT) will also be critical to Sea Basing, a key component of the Navy’s Sea Power 21 Concept.” 39 Vice Chief of Staff, U.S. Army Gen. Peter Chiarelli recently stated, “Access to information can mean the difference between living and dying.” 40 General William Wallace, USA (Ret.) goes on to caution that “despite the enormous benefits of using a network, it would be folly to lose sight of the fact that it is still merely a tool to aid the commander in understanding and decision making.” 41 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates wrote in his recent Foreign Affairs article, We should be modest about what military force can accomplish and what technology can accomplish. The advances in precision, sensor, information, and satellite technologies have led to extraordinary gains in what the U.S. military can do. The Taliban were dispatched within three months; Saddam’s regime was toppled in three weeks. A button can be pushed in Nevada, and seconds later a pickup truck will explode in Mosul. A bomb dropped from the sky can destroy a targeted house while leaving the one next to it intact. But no one should ever neglect the psychological, cultural, political, and human dimensions of warfare. 42 //<span style="font-size: 16px;">The question is not if DOD will proceed with NCW, but how.</span>//









**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Net-Centric Warfare independently stops nuclear war and prevents aggression, terrorism, and is key to heg</span>**

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Arquilla 10</span> (John Arquilla, professor of defense analysis at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, MARCH/APRIL 2010, “The New Rules of War”, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/22/the_new_rules_of_war)



In another sign of the gathering swarm, the August 2008 Russian incursion into Georgia, rather than being a blast from the Cold War past, heralded the possibility that more traditional armies can master the art of omnidirectional attack. In this instance, Russian regular forces were augmented by ethnic militias fighting all over the area of operations — <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">and there was swarming in cyberspace at the same time. Indeed, the distributed denial of service attack, long a staple of cyberwarriors, is a model form of swarming</span>. And in this instance, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Georgian command and control was seriously disrupted by the hackers</span>. Simultaneous attack from several directions might be at the very cutting edge in conflict, but its lineage is quite old. Traditional tribal warfare, whether by nomadic horse archers or bush fighters, always featured some elements of swarms. The zenith of this kind of fighting probably came with the 13th-century Mongols, who had a name for this doctrine: “Crow Swarm.” When the attack was not carried out at close quarters by charging horsemen, but was instead conducted via arrows raining down on massed targets, the khans called it “Falling Stars.” With such tactics, the Mongols carved out the largest empire the world has ever seen, and kept it for a few centuries. But swarming was eclipsed by the rise of guns in the 15th century, which strongly favored massed volley fire. Industrial processes encouraged even more massing, and mechanization favored large flank maneuvers more than small swarms. Now again, in an age of global interdependence replete with advanced information technologies, even quite small teams of fighters can cause huge amounts of disruption. There is an old Mongol proverb: “With 40 men you can shake the world.” Look at what al Qaeda did with less than half that number on Sept. 11, 2001. This point was made by the great British strategist B.H. Liddell Hart in his biography of T.E. Lawrence, a master of the swarm in his own right. Liddell Hart, writing in 1935, predicted that at some point “the old concentration of force is likely to be replaced by an intangibly ubiquitous distribution of force — pressing everywhere, yet assailable nowhere.” Now, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">swarming is making a comeback, but at a time when few organized militaries are willing or able to recognize its return. </span>For the implications of this development — most notably, that fighting units in very small numbers can do amazing things if used to swarm — are profoundly destabilizing. The most radical change is this: Standing armies can be sharply reduced in size, if properly reconfigured and trained to fight in this manner. Instead of continually “surging” large numbers of troops to trouble spots, the basic response of a swarm force would be to go swiftly, in small numbers, and strike the attackers at many points. In the future, it will take a swarm to defeat a swarm. Almost 20 years ago, I began a debate about networks that blossomed into an unlikely friendship with Vice Adm. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Art Cebrowski, the modern strategic thinker most likely to be as well remembered as Alfred Thayer Mahan, the great American apostle of sea power. He was the first in the Pentagon power structure to warm to my notions of developing fighting networks, embracing the idea of opening lots of lateral communications links between “sensors and shooters</span>.” We disagreed, however, about the potential of networks. Cebrowski thought that “<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">network-centric warfare” could be used to improve the performance of existing tools</span>— including aircraft carriers — for some time to come. I thought that networking implied a wholly new kind of navy, one made up of small, swift vessels, many of them remotely operated. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Cebrowski</span>, who passed away in late 2005, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">clearly won this debate</span>, as <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the U.S. Navy remains heavily invested in being a “few-large” force — if one that is increasingly networked</span>. In an implicit nod to David Ronfeldt’s and my ideas, the Navy even has a Netwar Command now. Swarming has also gained some adherents. The most notable has been Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, who famously used swarm tactics in the last great Pentagon war game, “Millennium Challenge 2002,” to sink several aircraft carriers at the outset of the imagined conflict. But rather than accept that something quite radical was going on, the referees were instructed to “refloat” the carriers, and the costly game — its price tag ran in the few hundred millions — continued. Van Riper walked out. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Today, some in the U.S. military still pursue the idea of swarming, mostly in hopes of employing large numbers of small unmanned aerial vehicles in combat</span>. But military habits of mind and institutional interests continue to reflect a greater audience for surges than swarms. What //<span style="font-size: 16px;">if senior military</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;"> leaders wake up and decide to take networks and swarming absolutely seriously</span>//? If they ever do, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">it is likely that the scourges of terrorism and aggression will become less a part of the world system</span>//. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Such a military would be smaller but quicker to respond, less costly but more lethal. The world system would become far less prone to many of the kinds of violence that have plagued it</span>. Networking and swarming are the organizational and doctrinal keys, respectively, to the strategic puzzle that has been waiting to be solved in our time. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">A networked U.S. military that knows how to swarm would have much smaller active manpower</span> — easily two-thirds less than the more than 2 million serving today — but would be organized in hundreds more little units of mixed forces. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The model for military intervention would be the 200 Special Forces “horse soldiers</span>” who beat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan late in 2001. Such teams would deploy quickly and lethally, with ample reserves for relieving “first waves” and dealing with other crises. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">At sea, instead of concentrating firepower in a handful of large, increasingly vulnerable supercarriers, the U.S. Navy would distribute its capabilities across many hundreds of small craft armed with very smart weapons.</span> Given their stealth and multiple uses, submarines would stay while carriers would go. And in the air, the “wings” would reduce in size but increase in overall number, with mere handfuls of aircraft in each. Needless to say, networking means that these small pieces would still be able to join together to swarm enemies, large or small. Is such a shift feasible? Absolutely. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Big reductions in the U.S. military are nothing new. The massive demobilization after World War II aside, active forces were reduced 40 percent in the few years after the Vietnam War and by another third right after the end of the Cold War</span>. But the key is not so much in cutting as it is in redesigning and rethinking. But what happens if the status quo prevails and the potential of this new round of changes in strategic affairs is ignored or misinterpreted? Failure awaits, at ruinous cost. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">The most likely form catastrophe </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">could take is that terrorist networks would stay on their feet long enough to acquire nuclear weapons</span>//. Even a handful of warheads in Osama bin Laden’s hands would give him great coercive power, as a network cannot be targeted for retaliation the same way a country can. Deterrence will lie in tatters. If there is ever to be a nuclear Napoleon, he will come from a terrorist network. Within the U.S. military, the danger is that senior commanders will fall back on a fatalism driven by their belief that both congressional and industrial leaders will thwart any effort at radical change. I have heard this objection countless times since the early 1990s, repeated mantra-like, all the way up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thus the mighty U.S. war machine is like a Gulliver trussed up by Lilliputian politicians and businessmen. The irony, however, is that <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the U.</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">S. military has never been in a better position to gain acceptance for truly transformational change</span>//<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">. Neither party in Congress can afford to be portrayed as standing in the way of strategic progress, and so, whatever the Pentagon asks for, it gets.</span> As for <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">defense contractors</span>, far from driving the agenda, they <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">are much too willing to give their military customers exactly what they demand</span> (rather than, perhaps, something better). <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">If the U.S. armed forces call for smaller, smarter weapons and systems to support swarming, they will get them. </span>Beyond the United States, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">other countries' security forces are beginning to think along the lines of "many and small," are crafting better ways to "find," and are learning to swarm. Chinese naval thought today is clearly moving in this direction. Russian ground forces are, too</span>. Needless to say, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">terrorist networks are still in the lead,</span> and not just al Qaeda. Hezbollah gave quite a demonstration of all three of the new rules of war in its summer 2006 conflict with Israel, a virtual laboratory test of nation versus network -- in which the network more than held its own. For the U.S. military, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">failing a great leap forward in self-awareness of the need for radical change, a downward budgetary nudge is probably the best approach</span> -- despite President Barack Obama's unwillingness to extend his fiscal austerity program to security-related expenditures. This could take the form of a freeze on defense spending levels, to be followed by several years of, say, 10 percent annual reductions. To focus the redesign effort, a moratorium would be declared on all legacy-like systems (think aircraft carriers, other big ships, advanced fighters, tanks, etc.) while they are subjected to searching review. It should not be assumed that the huge sums invested in national defense have been wisely spent. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">To most Americans who think that being strong on defense means devoting more resources and building bigger systems, this suggestion to cut spending will sound outrageous</span>. But <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">being smarter about defense might lower costs even as effectiveness improves. This pattern has held throughout the transformations of the last few decades, whether in farming or in industry. Why should the military be exempt? </span>There's real urgency to this debate. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Not only has history not ended with the Cold War and the advent of commerce-driven globalization, but conflict and violence have persisted -- even grown -- into a new postmodern scourge. </span>Indeed, it is ironic that, in an era in which the attraction to persuasive "soft power" has grown dramatically, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">coercive "hard power" continues to dominate in world affairs. This is no surprise in the case of rogue nations hellbent on developing nuclear arsenals to ensure their security, nor when it comes to terrorist networks that think their essential nature is revealed in and sustained by violent acts.</span> But <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">this primary reliance on coercive capabilities is also on display across a range of countries great and small, most notably the United States, whose defense policy has over the past decade largely become its foreign policy. From the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to simmering crises with North Korea and Iran, and on to longer-range strategic concerns about East Asian and Central European security, the United States today is heavily invested in hard-power solutions. And it will continue to be. But if the radical adjustments in strategy, organization, and doctrine implied by the new rules of war are ignored, Americans will go on spending more and getting less when it comes to national defense**.**</span>**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Networks will persist until they have the capability to land nuclear blows</span>**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">.Other countries will leapfrog ahead of the United States militarily, and concepts like "deterrence" and "containment" of aggression will blow away like leaves in the wind. </span>So it has always been. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Every era of technological change has resulted in profound shifts in military and strategic affairs</span>. History tells us that <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">these developments were inevitable, but soldiers and statesmen were almost always too late in embracing them -- and tragedies upon tragedies ensued. There is still time to be counted among the exceptions</span>, like the Byzantines who, after the fall of Rome, radically redesigned their military and preserved their empire for another thousand years. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The U.S. goal should be to join the ranks of those who, in their eras, caught glimpses of the future and acted in time to shape it, **saving the world from darkness**</span>







**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Terrorism risks Extinction</span>**

Dennis Ray <span style="font-size: 16px;">Morgan</span>, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Yongin Campus - South Korea Futures, Volume 41, Issue 10, December 20<span style="font-size: 16px;">09</span>, Pages 683-693, World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race

In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question “Is Nuclear War Inevitable??” In Section , Moore points out what most <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">terrorists</span>obviously already <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange</span>. As Moore points out, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">all</span> that militant <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb</span> and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Because of the Russian “dead hand” system, “where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,” it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States</span>” <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Israeli leaders</span> and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">would retaliate with the suicidal “Samson option</span>” against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even “anti-Semitic” European cities In that case, of course, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads,</span> many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">would rain </span>upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radi<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">oactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations </span>in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on</span>. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Any accident, mistaken communication, false signal or “lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason could, in a matter of a few minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons</span>, and once a weapon is used, then the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is actually less probable since <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">each country would act under the “use them or lose them” strategy and psychology</span>; restraint by one power would be interpreted as a weakness by the other, which could be exploited as a window of opportunity to “win” the war. In other words, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">once Pandora's Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them</span>. Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, “everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self-determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors” In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and once even just one is used, it is very likely that many, if not all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of much of human civilization while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter. In “Scenarios,” Moore summarizes the various ways a nuclear war could begin: <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Such a war could start through a reaction to terrorist attacks, or through the need to protect against overwhelming military opposition</span>, or through the use of small battle field tactical nuclear weapons meant to destroy hardened targets. It might quickly move on to the use of strategic nuclear weapons delivered by short-range or inter-continental missiles or long-range bombers. These could deliver high altitude bursts whose electromagnetic pulse knocks out electrical circuits for hundreds of square miles. Or they could deliver nuclear bombs to destroy nuclear and/or non-nuclear military facilities, nuclear power plants, important industrial sites and cities. Or it could skip all those steps and start through the accidental or reckless use of strategic weapons





<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">US involvement in the world is inevitable – failure to maintain hegemony ensures endless conflict and US re-intervention </span>

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Kagan 2007 </span>[Robert, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund, “End of Dreams, Return of History”, Hoover Institution - Stanford U, in Policy Review, No 144, [[http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/8552512.html#n10|http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/8552512.html#n10]]]

Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East</span>; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">and </span>now, increasingly, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Central Asia.</span> This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus.</span> The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as “No. 1” and are equally loath to relinquish it. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image.</span> They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe.The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying — its regional as well as its global predominance. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Were the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"> to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past</span>: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness.</span> One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic.It is </span>easy but also <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">dangerous to underestimate the role the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability.</span> For instance, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">is the dominant naval power everywhere</span>, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Even when the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance</span> at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Conflict</span>between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible.</span> Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe ’s stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war.People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that ’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War II</span>, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. </span>Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"> it is doubtful that it would suit</span> the tastes of <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">enlightenment liberals in the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"> and Europe.</span>The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world ’s great powers. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">and Japan. War </span>could erupt <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">between Russia and Georgia</span>, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">India and Pakistan</span>remains possible, as does conflict between <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Iran and Israel</span>or other Middle Eastern states. These,<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;"> too, could draw in other great powers, including the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates.<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Such conflicts</span> may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">are more likely to erupt if the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China ’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan.</span>In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">If the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">withdrew from Europe</span> — if it adopted what some call a strategy of “offshore balancing” — <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">this could</span> in time <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its</span> near <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">neighbors, which could in turn draw the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">back in under unfavorable circumstances.It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, “offshore” role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. </span>Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel ’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region</span>, both on the seas and on the ground.<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The subtraction of American power from any region would</span> not end conflict but would <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries.</span> The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn ’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition.</span> The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. </span>18 And <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran.</span> The world hasn ’t changed that much. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">back in again.</span>The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements.</span> Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.</span>

===Advantage Two: China=== 



<span style="font-size: 16px;">Al Qaeda is gearing up for Cyber-attacks – they have the capability</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Leghari ’11</span> [Faryal Leghari is Assistant Editor (Opinion) of Khaleej Times, “Hit C for cyberterrorism”, Jan 29, 2011, http://www.yobserver.com/opinions/10020698.html]



The defining word for the new age is ‘smart’. And it orbits the earth at a million bytes a minute. Whether it’s smart or not is merely a question of perspective. Smart for one may be intellectually deficient for another. What it does however is pitch a generation still in the middle stages of cyber evolution against one that is growing too fast too soon. Confusing? Not if you stand back from a vantage point and reflect on what is happening out there in cyber space. If you are not frozen in a perennial state of anxiety about being left behind, you are already sidelined. This may still be simplistic for those worrying about their social site updates and their be-on-the-top of the happening mode of the moment, but what about the immense challenge the whole technological gambit poses for the security arena? According to security analysts and intelligence specialists, __<span style="font-size: 16px;">cyberterrorism is a **big**</span>__ger **__<span style="font-size: 16px;">challenge</span>__** than supposed. __<span style="font-size: 16px;">The propensity of **Al Qaeda**</span>__and other terror groups __<span style="font-size: 16px;">to harness these means </span>__into a potentially lethal offensive capability__<span style="font-size: 16px;"> has **handed them a crucial advantage,** one they **have used with considerable success**.</span>__ Not only are terrorist groups culpable, but major world powers such as China and Russia too have been accused of launching cyber attacks against other states. Take for example the attacks on Estonia in 2007 or the one on Georgia in 2008 that brought the respective governments almost to a standstill. These were alleged to be perpetrated by Russia which later denied charges. Moreover, a cyber attack on the US federal agencies believed to be launched by North Korea in 2009 bring us to the strange new world of ‘virtual or cyber’ war. In today’s world, __<span style="font-size: 16px;">the heavy dependence on technology and computers, any attack — even</span>__ the one’s __<span style="font-size: 16px;">launched by non-state cyber criminals</span>__/hackers — **__<span style="font-size: 16px;">can spell disaster</span>__**, causing massive financial losses for organisations/corporate sector and civilians. One can only imagine the extent of damage an attack on state apparatus would inflict, let alone the security repercussions. For traditional terrorist groups using cyber space, there are numerous advantages. The proliferation of extremist websites standing in as recruitment boards and to spread propaganda makes cyber space a nurturing arena. Despite safeguards and the banning of several sites deemed threatening, the practice continues prolifically. __<span style="font-size: 16px;">The **easy accessibility and relatively cheap sources needed** to fund these activities **make it especially attractive**</span>__. With the growth of social networking sites, the most popular being Facebook and Twitter, the threat factor has actually rocketed. The Internet has put many disgruntled or easily influenced persons in direct or indirect contact with extremist elements. Take for example the Christmas Day Nigerian bomber Umer Farouk Abdulmuttalab who through initial cyber contact with the Yemeni cleric Anwar al Awlaki decided carry out a bombing onboard a Northwest plane to Detroit in 2009. The more discerning groups are continuously engaged in finding alternate routes to set platforms and coordinate attacks. The same portals are also used for standard communication. Often these groups engage hackers to facilitate their cyber operations, just like organised crime syndicates are used to coordinate and facilitate criminal/terror operations on ground. Drug trafficking, piracy, kidnappings, human trafficking are all areas that have seen a successful nexus being formed between terrorists and transnational organised crime syndicates. Moreover, hackers are used to provide intelligence information of government and security officials as vital support in planning physical targeted operations. Many security analysts and officials feel that cyberterrorism has not received due attention. Then there are also those who feel it is not a viable threat at present but may emerge in a more developed stage in future. However, it is still perceived that it may only be used in a subordinate support capacity. Interestingly, the opinion of top security officials differs. An international summit on cyber security by the East-West Institute in Dallas, Texas in 2010 brought together experts from a number of countries most of whom held cyberterrorism as a credible threat. They believed that the respective states including United States needed to revamp preventive measures against attacks in cyber space, implications of which were predicted to be monumental. According to a Guardian report dated May 5, 2010, Harry Raduege, former director at the Pentagon in charge of computer network warned that ‘cyber attacks were growing in intensity and sophistication.’ Similarly, the __<span style="font-size: 16px;">French director-</span>__general __<span style="font-size: 16px;">of information security</span>__ agency, Patrick __<span style="font-size: 16px;">Pailloux voiced his fears about attacks on ‘the electricity system, </span>__transport, water supplies, financial sector  and hospitals.’ This brings us to also look at areas beyond the traditional military arena. __<span style="font-size: 16px;">The critical areas of</span>__ __<span style="font-size: 16px;">power</span>__, water, health and financial institutions__<span style="font-size: 16px;"> **are all vulnerable to cyber attacks**</span>__. Unfortunately, there is a lack of understanding of threat perception as well as basic attention and safeguard measures to secure these vital areas from such attacks. Regrettably, these are relegated inadvertently to a blur in the future. A report by the East West Institute notes the economic losses for China resulting from hacking and viruses amount to nearly a billion dollars annually. On the positive side is a growing realisation of the actual potential of cyberterrorism and its nexus with international organised crime. The Second Worldwide Cybersecurity Summit is being held in London in June this year to follow up on the Dallas summit and determine measures designed to safeguard cybersecurity. It is hoped that regular discussions between top security experts help arrive at a strategy that encompasses measures that will make the world a safer place to live in. As we step in the futuristic age, cyber attacks have begun to become a reality and not something one would enjoy as an integral part of the bigger picture. While a global cybersecurity treaty may still take years to come through, it is time to shape our defenses accordingly.



**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Cyber war reverses the nuclear taboo – new forms of war ensure accidental launch</span>**

Stephen <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Cimbala</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">,</span> professor of political science at the Pennsylvania State University Delaware County Campus, Summer 19<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">99</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">,</span> “Accidental/Inadvertent Nuclear War and Information Warfare.” Armed Forces & Society: An Interdisciplinary Journal [Bapodra]

The end of Cold War has led some to assume that <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">nuclear weapons</span>and nuclear deterrence <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">are passe.</span> Along with this, is a related <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">assumption that a revolution in high technology, conventional weaponry will accelerate the rate of nuclear political and military obsolescence. On the other hand, all concede that the "revolution in military affairs" is driven mostly by new technologies in information, communications, and electronics</span>. [1] New information and <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">communication technologies may enable new forms of war making, including information warfare, that are dysfunctional for deterrence stability with, or without, nuclear weapons. It is possible that the remnants of pax atomica will combine with attacks using the new strategies of information to produce an outcome no one favors: accidental or inadvertent nuclear war or escalation.</span> In order to proceed, we need a working definition of information warfare. A large literature offers candidate views on the concept of information warfare. [2] <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">For present purposes, information warfare can be defined as activities by one state or nonstate actor against another that attempt to disrupt, deceive, or destroy one or more of the following attributes of military or military related information</span>: (1) the physical aspects of information transfer or communication, such as landlines, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">radio receivers, satellites</span>, commanders, and command posts, not to exclude the flow of electrons back and forth between senders and receivers; (2) <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the communications contents, consisting of asserted facts, ideas, proposals, and other messages</span>; (3) the network of channels by which sender are receiver are connected and organizational behaviors influenced; (4) the security protocols that authenticate a message sender and/or enable senders and receivers to pass information back and forth without giving it away to the enemy; and, (5) <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">perseons in the security decision-making process, including their role perceptions and their images of the adversary that might be influenced by infowar. </span>









<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Chinese behavior proves they are realist and already think the US is a threat and are preparing for war</span>

Washington cocktail-party <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">conversations about China typically go something like this: A person from the China-as-a-peer-competitor school of thought says "I think China</span>, with its growing economy, growing military, and young, nationalistic population, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">will only naturally lock horns with the U.S. in future decades." An advocate of the enmity-is-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy school responds "Maybe, but casting the Chinese in an adversarial role now will serve to drive them away from the U.S. </span>and from a friendship that I think they're open to." As the impasse is marked with polite sipping of the Cabernet Sauvignon, each guest searches for rescue by a more like-minded conversationalist. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Turning the tables on such an exchange is the new report</span> of //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Congress's U.S.-China Security Review Commission</span>//<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">.</span> Never mind what you chatterers think, the bipartisan report seems to interject, because <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the die is cast: "China's leaders consistently characterize the United States as a 'hegemon,</span>' connoting a powerful protagonist and overbearing <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">bully that is China's major competitor, but they also believe that the United States is a declining power with important military vulnerabilities that can be exploited. China views itself as an emerging power." </span>Specifically, China's military leaders are focusing on several investments and advances cannot be mistaken for anything but preparations for conflict against the U.S. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">This focus is far from meaning that conflict is inevitable</span>//<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">.</span> It doesn't even rule out cooperation and close U.S.-China ties in a variety of areas. But it <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">should stop in its tracks any wishful thinking that China doesn't already see the U.S. as a potential military adversary</span>. It should also make apparent that <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">China's leaders</span>, for their part, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">aren't worried that their planning will alienate the United States. Among China'</span>s U.S.-oriented military ambitions, it <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">seeks to advance its: Ability to sink a U.S. carrier</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">: </span>China has publicly stated that it intends to be able to sink an American aircraft carrier. Among the technologies that could allow China to do this are anti-ship cruise missiles, which China could fire from land across long distances, and which it is now developing. China is also developing an over-the-horizon radar network with which to track surface ships. China has reportedly bought from Russia eight new Kilo-class diesel subs. China, which already has four of the subs is to take delivery of the eight beginning in 2007. China's growing fleet of diesel subs is supplemented by a program to develop nuclear subs, the congressional report says. The nuclear sub development, called "Project 093," is to begin between 2003-05 and already has Russian cooperation. Whether this program will be successful is far from clear, however. In addition, China is acquiring the high-speed Russian anti-ship SS-22 Sunburn missile, and advanced wake-homing torpedoes. Some of these advances could be used in anti-submarine warfare against the U.S. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Focus on asymmetrical warfare</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">:</span>China's President Jiang Zemin in 1999 called for the People's Liberation Army to develop weapons with which a technologically inferior Chinese military might defeat a technologically superior U.S. one. More specifically, China seeks to develop "assassin's mace" weapons -- what Americans might call a "magic bullet" -- with which to attack U.S. vulnerabilities. This focus on "asymmetrical warfare" draws on two millennia of Chinese strategic tradition. The congressional report says China focuses on such weaknesses as U.S. reliance on computer networks, dependency on satellites for military reconnaissance, navigation, and communications. The Chinese also plan to target business communications, and specific systems such as the New York Stock Exchange computers or the communications and computers of airbases and carriers. Another example of an asymmetrical capability, though not one discussed in the report, is China's existing ability to launch a massive missile barrage against Taiwan or a traditional U.S. basing site such as Okinawa, Japan. The threat of such a barrage could pressure Japan to deny the U.S. access to Okinawa, thereby exploiting U.S. over-dependency on foreign bases in the event of a Taiwan conflict. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Focus on space</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">: China has seven military satellites and is building more. It has a modest, two-satellite version of the U.S. Global Positioning System of satellites, and has plans to expand it. Other research on China published by the Pentagon has pointed out that the PLA is developing ground-based anti-satellite technology.</span> While these advances don't spell out a future in which China will be a U.S. "peer," China is definitely a "competitor." It would be convenient and reassuring to dismiss China's military advances and the recently announced expansion of its military spending by 17.6% as measures directed at the perennial tensions with Taiwan. But <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the advances outlined here are focused on countering U.S. capabilities, not Taiwanese ones</span>. To be sure, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Chinese military planners may be calculating that the U.S. would get involved in a cross-strait military conflict. But there's more to China's range of investments than planning for a brush with the U.S. in the Taiwan Strait. </span>Rather, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">China's military planners seem to think the possibility of a large-scale, future military conflict between them and the dominant Pacific power is real, and should be prepared for. That's not necessarily a bellicose conclusion, it's just realist. And since it's Beijing's conclusion</span>, __<span style="font-size: 16px;">there's no reason Washington should draw a different one</span>____<span style="font-size: 16px;">. </span>__



**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Strong and diverse ISR and Satellite capabilities deter short term China Attack</span>**

Chung-chian <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Teng</span> is Dean of the College of International Affairs at National Chengchi University <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Kuo-Hsiung <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Lee</span> is the director of the Natural Products Research Laboratories at UNC Chapel Hill <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">08</span> [“China's Militarization of Space: Motivations and Implications for U.S-Chinese Relations”, NCCU, Chapter Six: Space Militarization: Implications for U.S.-Chinese Relations, pdf]

In many ways <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">China’s counter-space platforms</span>, such as its already operational directed-energy, ground-based lasers and its direct-ascent, solid-fueled (and therefore rapidly deployable) ASAT missiles that can be launched from any of China’s hundreds of road-mobile, SRBM and MRMB launchers, already <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">represent a real threat to U.S. forces</span>. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This threat will only grow and ramify with time, perhaps geometrically so, as the PRC continues to grow its young stock of operational</span> Dong Feng-31 (DF-31) road-mobile <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">ICBMs</span>, which while generally thought to be tipped with 400 kiloton nuclear <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">warheads</span>,235 <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">could be modified to attack U.S. national security satellites in GEO</span> with KKVs or future co-orbital killer satellites, EMP weapons and high-powered microwave weapons, all of which are under development. In the interim, General Cartwright’s statement, mentioned previously, that the PRC would be able to destroy all the U.S. reconnaissance satellites in LEO by 2010 appears to be correct.236 According to Desmond Ball, it would require approximately 20 ASAT missiles of the type that destroyed FY-1C last year to destroy 6-7 LEO satellites, which is the number of current U.S. Crystal and Lacrosse space vehicles currently believed to be in orbit. Assuming they passed over or near the PRC, U.S. spy satellites would indeed be vulnerable to China’s ASAT weapons by 2010, as 20 operational, direct-ascent ASAT missiles would presumably be easy enough to field by that time given that the PRC is already mass-producing well over a hundred similar missile platforms a year. All one would need to modify would be the warhead and guidance package, both of which have been already been proven and have been operational as of January 11, 2007.237 The PLA can be expected to continue to develop its ASAT guidance package (which is reportedly radar based and therefore highly vulnerable to jamming) in order to overcome U.S. defense satellites’ built-in counter-measures, which are thought to be quite technologically impressive.238 Therefore the PRC already has an operational ASAT capability, and one that is likely to grow in sophistication and capability. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This will add to the U.S. imperative to counter and deter the Chinese counter-space weapons, and further fuel the U.S.-Sino cold war style build-up in space mentioned previously. In the near-term China is unlikely to be able to compete directly with the U.S., and therefore will continue its asymmetric efforts to exploit the U.S. vulnerability in space.</span> Looking more distantly, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">however, one can forecast a situation where China is competing with the U.S. in space</span>(and <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">on terra firma</span>) as more of a peer-competitor. In such a situation, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">whereby there is a relative balance of power and mutual reliance upon orbital space, one could foresee increased stability and something akin to the détente that characterized the later stages of the cold war and led to U.S.-Soviet cooperation in outer space</span>. However, as noted by a recent study, it will be a long time before the PRC can be considered a true peer competitor of the U.S. in space.239 //<span style="font-size: 16px;">In the interim</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">, there is a strong possibility that the relationship between the two powers will be unstable, withpotential global repercussions</span>//. China’s irresponsible actions in space only underscore that growing trend, and point to a disturbing strategic environment in the years ahead. That said, the likely U.S. response to any ASAT attack on an American government satellite, which would be viewed much in the same way that an attack on U.S. terrestrial forces would be (i.e. an act of war), probably rule it out barring a massive miscalculation on the part of the Chinese leadership or a Chinese decision to engage in a Pearl Harbor style sneak attack. The danger lies in the fact that as the PRC’s counter-space capabilities grow and become more subtle with the development of micro-satellites, nano-satellites and other less conspicuous ASAT platforms which could potentially interfere with U.S. satellites without going so far as destroying them, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the U.S.-Sino relationship in space may become more unstable because the potential Chinese menu of options would be increasingly tempting</span>, offering as it would ever more possibilities at a time when the U.S. reliance upon satellites was ever greater. To <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">offset this scenario</span>, which would mix a dangerous brew of Chinese capabilities with U.S. vulnerabilities in a situation <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">that could escalate rapidly to general war, the U.S. can be expected to not only diversify and strengthen its orbital assets, but also to develop better air-breathing reconnaissance platforms</span>, such as smaller, stealthier Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV) with longer dwell times in order to have the ability to rapidly restore lost satellite coverage in a crisis. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This U.S. diversification and multiplication of reconnaissance assets would thereby both strengthen the durability of its C4ISR network and force the PRC to plan for more targets, thus making it a less tempting option and creating an environment for better deterrence</span>. Let us now conclude this chapter with a summation and a brief policy suggestion.



**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">US-China War over Taiwan goes nuclear – most likely scenario for conflict</span>**

Richard C. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Bush</span>, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and director of its Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Michael E. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">O'Hanlon</span>, senior fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution, where he specializes in U.S. defense strategy, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">07</span> [“A war like no other: the truth about China's challenge to America”, p. 186, google books]

<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">If war resulted, escalation pressures would be enormous</span>. It would be the first significant war between nuclear weapons states in world history. And the nuclear arsenals of the two sides could, as unreasonable and illogical as it sounds, come into play. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Nuclear exchanges</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;"> could even result</span>//. At a time when <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the threat of superpower nuclear war has become much less vivid in the public eye</span> due to the end of the Cold War, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">a Taiwan crisis could—ironically enough—quickly create </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">the most serious nuclear risk </span>//<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">since the Cuban Missile Crisis</span>. The conclusion is not intended to be melodramatic. Even in the event of war, the risk of nuclear conflagration would be be much less than fifty-fifty, since both sides would surely recognize the dangers. But <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">crises have dynamics all their own</span>. What neither side would see as desirable could nonetheless occur as the fog of war impeded accurate and timely <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">information flows and clouded leaders’ judgments—and</span> as <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the loss of lives raised the stakes to the point whereneither Beijing nor Washington could easily back down</span>. In addition, the war plans of the two sides could create momentum of their own. Although details are classified (and always changing in any even), <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">in the past these war plans apparently have called for hastier escalation than political leaders generally appreciate</span>. This may have changed of late, and certainly recent American commanders in the region have been sensitive to the need to build positive relationships with China and to avoid assuming that conflict would quickly escalate. But <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">predisposition to restraint may not easily survive direct combat with a major military power; arguments in favor of rapid escalation will be powerful</span>, whether or not the carry the day. Leaders in Taiwan, China, and the United States need to think these issues through thoroughly in advance—for the sake of their war plans, their diplomacy, and their politics. They must figure out how to avoid escalation in any serious crisis or war that beings—for once the three parties get to that point, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">avoiding all-out U.S.-China war is more important than other realistic concerns</span>. Indeed, it is so paramount in importance that Taipei, Beijing, and Washington must avoid the temptation to manufacture crises or play politics with the independence of sovereignty issues.

Fifteen years ago, when U.S. military leaders were trying to anticipate future communications demands, they knew U.S. forces could be called upon at any time to fight or offer humanitarian assistance anywhere in the world. They knew voice, video and data traffic would continue to grow. What they didn’t foresee was widespread use of unmanned aircraft. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Today, hundreds of unmanned planes are streaming videos and relaying sensor data over satellites</span>, said Army Col. Patrick Rayermann, director of satellite communications integration at the U.S. Defense Department’s National Space Security Office. “It’s the killer app<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">.” The drone war is the best known driver for the skyrocketing communications demand, but it is far from the only one</span>. Increasingly, military forces want to maintain communications while traveling in aircraft, ships, ground vehicles and even on foot. “Our customers are constantly striving to have a service that is more mobile,” said Andrew Beegan, vice president and chief technology officer for global communications provider Segovia Inc. of Herndon, Va., a subsidiary of Inmarsat. Even the push for smartphones could factor in. Those phones will be used primarily to send information over local wireless networks, but some photographs or videos will need to be transmitted between tactical enclaves, which means sending the data over future aerial or satellite networks, Rayermann said. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This combination of growing demand, tightening defense budgets and rising commercial prices has defense officials searching for better ways to obtain satellite services.</span> Commercial satellite leaders are rushing in to make suggestions, while defending their pricing and pushing the idea of hosting more government payloads on their satellites, or perhaps leasing entire satellites. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The U.S. military has begun laying the groundwork for closer cooperation with the industry and allies. It is making plans to build communications networks that integrate the government’s own satellites with commercial spacecraft and those used by U.S. coalition partners. </span>The U.S. already has agreements in place to share satellites with the United Kingdom and Australia. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The U.S. </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">N</span>//<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">ational </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">S</span>//<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">ecurity </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">S</span>//<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">pace </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">S</span>//<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">trategy released in February underscores the need for allies and coalition partners to share satellites for surveillance and communications,</span> said Gregory Schulte, U.S. deputy undersecretary of defense for space policy, in a briefing for reporters. Wanted: Detailed requirements Even as the U.S. military embraces commercial services as part of the answer, defense strategists show no signs of backing away from their plans to spend billions upgrading their own satellites. In February 2012, the U.S. Navy plans to launch the first satellite in a constellation of Mobile User Objective System spacecraft to serve forces in the most remote locations. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">In August, the U.S. Air Force launched the first spacecraft in a planned constellation of Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellites, which provide highly protected, secure communications for the national leadership.</span> The Air Force plans to keep launching Wideband Global Satcom spacecraft to provide less protected broadband communications for U.S. forces on ships and on bases. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Military officials are under no illusion that they can keep up with surging demand, or that adding military satellites can be the answer</span>. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">It takes at least seven years for the government to develop and launch a new spacecraft. </span>If the services were willing to wait that long, it would be difficult to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in upfront funding in the current budget climate, government and industry officials said. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Commercial firms, on the other hand, can build and launch new satellites in three to four years, and they are planning to do so.</span> As it stands, however, commercial providers must make guesses about the exact capabilities that the military and intelligence community want in a commercial satellite. “Why doesn’t the government provide its requirements to industry so they can be incorporated in commercial satellites from the beginning?” said retired U.S. Navy Cmdr. J.J. Shaw, director for North America and Global Naval Programs for Inmarsat Government Services of Washington. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">“If industry knows what the government is looking for in terms of capabilities, security and information assurance, companies would respond</span>.” <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The government could, if it wanted, lease entire satellites. Leasing would spread out the cost of service over many years</span>, something that is much easier to pay for in an era of flat or reduced military spending, Shaw added. In fact, in April, defense officials asked companies to comment on a U.S. Central Command plan to lease its own dedicated communications satellite. That project, known as Assured SATCOM in a Single Theater, is the first step in a serious effort to determine whether the Defense Department can trim expenses by making a long-term commitment to lease a communications satellite, Rayermann said. Also in April, U.S. Space of Dulles, Va., was awarded a $291,000 contract by the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center in Los Angeles to find ways to acquire satellite communications quickly and inexpensively. The award was the latest in a steady stream of contracts and announcements that indicate a new determination on the part of government officials to meet the demand by reining in the amount the government pays for satellite communications. New contracting approach To simplify the way military and civilian government agencies obtain specific commercial satellite services, the U.S. Defense Information Services Agency (DISA) and the U.S. General Services Administration have joined forces to establish a one-stop shop known as Future Commercial Satellite Communications Services Acquisition (FCSA). Through that program, which could cost $10 billion over five years, DISA is negotiating satellite service contracts that would remain in place for five years with options for three to five additional years. The FCSA contracts, which replace existing satellite communications service contracts including Defense Satellite Transmission Services Global, are designed to make it easier for military units to obtain needed satellite communications services, said Col. Michelle Nassar, chief of DISA’s Commercial Satellite Communications Center. Under FCSA contracts, government organizations can lease satellite transponder capacity and obtain satellite communications subscription services or end-to-end solutions, which include bandwidth equipment, operations and maintenance. The end-to-end solutions will be offered through the FCSA Custom SATCOM Solutions, or CS2 program, Nasser said by email. Military officials have lamented the rising cost of satellite services offered under new FCSA contracts. Prices are higher, industry officials said, because there is far less available satellite communications capacity where it is needed most, above U.S. theaters of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Still, industry officials expect FCSA prices to decrease as additional contracts are negotiated and more vendors join the program. “Everyone wants to win a task order under FCSA so we can call news organizations like yours to announce our success,” one industry official said. To cut communications costs, for example, military officials might consider easing some satellite communications performance requirements, this official said<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">. The FCSA contract calls on all providers to offer satellite communications featuring 99.999 percent performance.</span> If there are certain jobs that do not require that level of performance, the government could save money by agreeing to accept lower standards. For example, a contract could lay out varied requirements, such as 99.999 percent performance for high-priority communications, but a lower standard for something like logistics data. For that type of contract, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">service providers could make more efficient use of transponders and offer lower costs by allowing less essential data to move across capacity shared by multiple users. In addition, the armed services could save money by making multiyear commitments to pay for a certain minimum amount of satellite bandwidth</span>. If government agencies can enter a five-year agreement to buy bandwidth, the price would be significantly lower than the current costs of satellite capacity purchased one year at a time, said retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Craig Weston, chief executive for satellite service provider U.S. Space. Once you consider multiyear commitments, it makes sense for government officials to consider long-term leases or the outright purchase of dedicated commercial satellites, he added. Industry officials also suggest the armed services take advantage of the plethora of commercial launches by sending their own communications payloads into orbit as hosted payloads. To promote the idea, the Hosted Payload Alliance was established in March by Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems, Intelsat General Corp., Iridium Communications Inc., Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Orbital Sciences Corp., SES World Skies U.S. Government Solutions and Space Systems/Loral. The U.S. Army’s 2010 test of an Internet router in orbit is likely to pave the way for more hosted payloads, industry officials said. The Cisco-supplied Internet Routing in Space device, called ISIS, was launched as a payload on the Intelsat 14 satellite. “We think that’s a great model,” said Philip Harlow, president and chief operating officer of satellite service provider Xtar LLC of Rockville, Md. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">If the primary payload does not tap out the satellite’s weight and power requirements, a secondary payload can benefit by paying a fraction of the cost of a dedicated spacecraft</span>, Harlow added. Demand and supply Officials on all sides are certain there is no going back to a situation in which the military satisfies its own demand. Before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the U.S. military’s own satellites supplied 80 percent of the bandwidth used by U.S. forces. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Now, 80 percent of the communications are supplied by commercial satellites</span>. In 2009, the U.S. communications director in Iraq told attendees at a satellite conference that 96 percent of the communications requirements of U.S. Central Command were being handled by commercial satellites. The U.S. government’s current demand for an estimated 20 gigabytes per second of bandwidth is approximately twice the amount currently available, said Craig Cooning, chairman of Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems, at the Satellite 2011 conference in Washington. “<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">By 2019, the demand will reach 50 gigabytes per second, and only 60 percent of that will be met,”</span> he added. “<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The military appetite for bandwidth will never decrease, even after we draw down in the Middle East,”</span> Weston said. Industry already is responding to consumer and government demand by launching new satellites and offering new services. London-based Inmarsat, Hughes Communications, Yahsat of the United Arab Emirates, Iridium Communications, Paris-based Eutelsat and ViaSat Inc. are investing billions of dollars in new Ka-band satellites that promise lightning-quick data transmission rates. Competitors warn that Ka-band service can be degraded by dust and rain, but government and industry officials said the benefits of high data throughput combined with smaller antenna sizes will make both military and commercial Ka-band an important component of any future satellite communications network. Planning would be required for U.S. forces to make seamless use of military and commercial Ka-band because private companies and the military rely on different Ka-band ranges. The military uses 20.2 gigahertz to 21.2 gigahertz as the downlink frequency for Ka-band communications, and 30 to 31 gigahertz as the uplink frequencies bands. Commercial satellites use 17.7 to 20.2 gigahertz for the downlink and 27.5 to 30 gigahertz for the uplink. The Defense Department’s Wideband Global Satcom, which provides services to military users for free, transmits data in the military Ka-band and also X-band frequencies. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Right now, military agencies do not have any ground terminals designed to operate in both the commercial and military Ka-band frequencies, but service officials are considering purchasing or leasing that type of equipment because it would offer greater flexibility</span>, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center’s Military Satellite Communications Systems Directorate. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">To meet requirements to encrypt all military signals prior to broadcast, service officials also may need to obtain additional equipment to enhance security for new ground terminals</span>. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">There will be no silver bullet, some officials warn. It will take a combination of satellites operating in different frequency bands to satisfy military demand</span>. Much of the military’s existing satellite infrastructure operates in X-band frequencies. “Traditionally, terminal and network investments account for over 75 percent of the overall satellite communications enterprise costs,” the Air Force said in a written response to questions. “Transitioning off X-band terminals to Ka-band will be costly, and take time. In addition, X-band offers signal properties, such as better resistance to weather effects, which are attractive to some customers.” The military’s recently released blueprint for satellite communications, the Joint Space Communications Layer Initial Capabilities Document, lays out the military’s goal of developing a flexible architecture that will allow the armed services to maintain communications in any environment. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Communications has become such an essential component of military operations that senior military planners want to ensure that no adversary can halt it. In terms of adversaries, Schulte said, it’s not just China that has proven its ability to jam satellite signals.</span> “Iran has used counter-space capabilities and Ethiopia has,” Shulte told reporters. “Now it’s not anti-satellite weapons, but they have jammed commercial satellites that have been used to carry the British Broadcasting Corp. and the Voice of America. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry about what others can do.” Still, military officials do not envision creating a communications network that is immune to interference</span>. The Joint Space Communications Layer describes plans for communications in a benign environment, a contested environment and a nuclear environment. When U.S. military communications are not being degraded by attacks or jamming, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">U.S. forces can rely heavily on commercial, military and coalition satellites to keep traffic flowing at high data rates</span>. U.S. forces also must be prepared to operate in a contested environment when some of those high data-rate communications links are likely to be degraded. At those times, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the military will be forced to rely more heavily on its own satellites, which are designed to resist jamming and interference</span>. Even the Wideband Global Satcom constellation, which will be less sophisticated than the AEHF constellation in terms of security, gives users the ability to monitor spectrum and power to limit interference of signals, the Air Force said. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">In a contested environment, data transmission speeds may be lower, but military communications traffic will continue to flow. In the event of a nuclear war, “we need to be able to operate and to communicate, but not at the tactical and operational levels as much as at the national nuclear force level</span>,” Rayermann said. While the military wants the ability to maintain communications in any environment, that doesn’t mean it would be wise to pay for all the capacity the Defense Department could possibly need. “<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">One of the challenges is we know we need to be ready but we don’t know when and where,” </span>Rayermann said. Given that uncertainty, military planners envision paying for moderate global capability and establishing the contracts and agreements with commercial providers that would allow the department to cope with a sudden surge in demand.

Though U.S. Air Force officials are hailing the forthcoming launch of a military payload hosted on a commercial satellite, funding could be an obstacle to a future Pentagon satellite infrastructure that relies heavily on hosted payloads for service. SES-2 is slated to launch Sept. 17 on an Ariane 5 rocket. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The satellite, made by Orbital Sciences Corp., will carry the Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload (Chirp)</span> made by Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC). The project is a “hallmark of cooperation and opportunity” that brought together an “incredible combination of different interests,” says Douglas Loverro, executive director of the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC). The payload includes one of four infrared telescopes designed by SAIC under an Air Force program started in the middle of the decade to find an alternative in the event that the performance of Space-Based Infrared System (Sbirs) prime contractor Lockheed Martin continued to disappoint, threatening to expose a gap in ballistic missile warning. The government opted to use one of the 2,000 X 2,000-pixel wide-field-of-view staring infrared arrays for experimentation. The concept emerged through a proposal from SES, Orbital (the satellite manufacturer) and SAIC<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">. In total, the government spent about $216 million developing the sensors, readying the payload and integrating it onto the satellite, Loverro says. Originally, the sensor piece of the project was slated to cost $65 million</span>. That changed to about $82.5 million owing to a one-year delay in the project, says Lt. Col. William McGuffey, director of SMC’s space projects division. Tip Osterthaler, president and CEO of SES Government Solutions, says <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Chirp is expected to reach orbit at about 15% of the typical cost for a government payload to be lofted.</span> Loverro, however, notes that while qualified for space operations, the Chirp payload is not designed to meet the rigorous demands of nuclear hardening and integrated threat-warning and attack-assessment certification required for the Sbirs satellites. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">However, with the cost of the first Sbirs and Advanced Extremely High-Frequency satellites at well more than $1 billion, Loverro says he is exploring constellations that provide an alternative to simply buying more of these large spacecraft.AEHF is designed to provide jam-proof communications, including traffic to nuclear forces in the event of a nuclear war.</span> Loverro suggests, for example, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">that alternative</span>Sbirs and AEHF <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">fleets could reserve the nuclear-hardened portions of the mission for the basic spacecraft, with hosted payloads providing augmenting data</span>. Both of these missions require hardware in the geosynchronous belt, where many commercial spacecraft operate. The question, however, is if this alternative approach will prove to be less costly. “<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">If you can’t develop an architecture where the hosted payloads don’t decrease the cost of the rest of the architecture, then they really can’t earn their way onto the plate</span>,” Loverro says. He says he still has a year of work to do to refine these alternative architecture concepts. In the meantime, Air Force officials will experiment with Chirp. Initially, the satellite will be inserted at 77 deg. West and eventually shift to 87 deg. West, its final operational slot. The Air Force plans to experiment with Chirp for just more than nine months. The orbital location is situated to provide coverage of infrared events on the West Coast of the U.S. as well as at White Sands Missile Range, N.M.



**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">And ensures bandwidth shortages are resolved without sacrificing military-grade protection</span>**

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Erwin ‘11</span> (Sandra Erwin, “For the Satellite Industry, Lines Blur Between Military and Commercial Markets,” National Defense, NDIA’s business and technology magazine, 3-18-2011, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=350]]</span>)

<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">In contrast to their skeptical attitude about refueling technologies, the executives sounded positively enthused about business opportunities in the area of “hosted payloads”</span> for government customers. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">A hosted payload is a secondary payload that is added usually to a commercial satellite, and used to perform a separate mission</span>. It is viewed as an efficient way to use up excess satellite capacity and it saves agencies the huge cost of buying or leasing an entire spacecraft. The Air Force forecasts increase use of hosted payloads, said Gregory L. Schulte, deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy. Speaking at a House Armed Services Committee strategic forces subcommittee March 16, Schulte said a military infrared sensor payload is set to launch probably this summer on a commercial communications satellite. “<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">That infrared payload will help us with the next generation of our missile warning satellites in determining whether or not that's the right technology we want to use</span>,” he said. Defense agencies have been working with hosted payloads for many years, he said. The problem is that the development pace of new payloads can’t always keep up with the commercial industry’s launch plans “So it's a thing that we're exploring,” Schulte said. “We'll see how this works out with this first one and we'll continue to explore opportunities.” The Federal Aviation Administration also has been a consumer of hosted payloads to augment its air-traffic navigation system. Companies see a growing market in the Defense Department and NASA, which may be looking at deploying additional transponders or science payloads. Government agencies and satellite suppliers are still trying to figure out how to make this work, said Foust. “There’s a little bit of a learning curve from both sides,” he said. The biggest issues is trying to synchronize the schedules so that companies that build payloads have them ready to go at the same time that a new satellite is set to launch. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Boeing is going to be aggressively courting this market, said O’Neill. The company already has been involved in several hosted payload programs over the last 15 years</span>, he said. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">A huge opportunity is coming up in four years when Iridium is expected to begin launching 72 new satellites to replace its current constellation. These will be bigger satellites, O’Neill said. “Each has volume, mass, communications capacity set aside for hosted payloads. … We feel confident that before the Iridium train starts leaving the station four years from now that we can fill up a reasonable fraction of the hosted payload capacity on the satellites.”</span> Craig Cooning, CEO of Boeing Satellite Systems International, hailed hosted payloads as the answer to the military’s communications bandwidth shortage. The U.S. government’s current demand for military satellite bandwidth is estimated to be 20 gigabytes per second, which is twice the amount of what is available, Cooning said in a keynote speech at Satellite 2011. By 2019 the demand will reach 50 gigabytes per second, and only 60 percent of that will be met. The rapid expansion military unmanned aircraft has been a major factor is the shortage of satellite capacity. Air Force pilots operate UAVs over Afghanistan, for instance, from bases in the United States. These two-way links require enormous amounts of bandwidth. “This is a problem for the war fighter, but it’s also a great opportunity for our industry,” Cooning said. “One of Boeing’s key recommendations to address this shortfall is a hosted payload. … We believe that a hosted payload can help the U.S. government with its bandwidth needs, and also the commercial satellite services provider, which benefits from a second source of revenue.” Boeing recently formed a new commercial satellite services division to tackle this portion of the market. “Literally any satellite service – in any frequency band – can be provided through a hosted payload,” Cooning said. “<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">That includes weather monitoring; surveillance; protected military communications; mobile communications; and business communications</span>.” Boeing’s foray into the commercial business is viewed as a sign that the company expects the military business to soften, Foust said. “Boeing had been on the sidelines in the commercial satellite business for several years.” Now, they are entering the sector in a big way.

**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Only hosted payloads can provide sufficient protected communications to support net-centric operations</span>**

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Rosario & Rousseau ‘9</span> (J. Del Rosario, and C. Rousseau, Northern Sky Research, LLC, “An Analysis of Hosted Payloads and Dual-use Satellites as Middle Ground between Commercial Outsourcing and Internal Asset Deployment,” paper presented at the ISU 13th Annual International Symposium: Space for a Safe and Secure World, February 18-20, 2009)

The government and military vertical has been a stable and growing market for commercial satellite service providers in recent years. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">However, there is a commensurably increasing concern that militaries and governments may be becoming too reliant on commercial capacity that is regarded as less secure</span>compared to internal space assets. Increased bandwidth requirements particularly on the military side have led to pronouncements by the U.S. Military for instance that it cannot be self-reliant until at least the year 2020. The growing bandwidth crunch has led to plans to increase deployment of proprietary satellite assets, which cost in the US $billions. Programs such as Wideband Global Satcom (WGS), Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and the Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT) have been slated as budget line items to specifically address the growing bandwidth needs of the U.S. Military. Yet, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">funding for expensive military programs have been slashed including the next-generation TSAT program, which was to be among the cornerstones for “Netcentric Warfare.” Pure commercial outsourcing that raise concerns over security, reliability and availability of capacity coupled with the high costs and slow deployment</span> of proprietary military assets are creating huge challenges for militaries and governments worldwide in how to address warfighting requirements in the next decade. An idea that has been regularly discussed in light of budget considerations is to host a government or military payload on a commercial satellite. Dual-use programs for use by both commercial and government clients have been in existence for governments like Australia and South Korea. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">This presentation will examine and analyze the case for hosted payloads and dual-use satellite systems,</span> including: The Big Picture Speed to Deployment Technical Attributes Technical Concerns Easy Retrofit or Large-scale Re-engineering The Bottom Line The Big Picture The military business, specifically the U.S. Military, has been a stable and growing vertical market over at least the past seven years, in particular since the Iraq war. Satellite operators and service providers have spun-off government entities specifically to serve military and government customers more efficiently, and these divisions account for a growing revenue stream with little sign of slowing down. Increased military bandwidth requirements over the long term lead to a question of deploying more satellite capacity in order to support a relatively stable business, yet satellite operators have not taken risks even when the Pentagon has indicated that it cannot be selfreliant until at least the year 2020. The move is understandable given that longer term military contracts are hard to come by, unlike the video markets where transponder capacity is signed over the long term. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">On the military side, a seemingly growing bandwidth crunch has led to plans to increase deployment of proprietary satellite assets, which cost in the $billions</span>. Programs such as Wideband Gapfiller Satellite (WGS), Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and the Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT) have been slated as budget line items to specifically address the growing bandwidth needs of the U.S. Military. However, budget processes are oftentimes arduous and protracted in justifying procurement of such assets, particularly during times when governments are faced with other seemingly more pressing issues such as financial bailouts in order to restore the health of their economy, if not the entire global financial system. Budget Considerations in Light of the Current State of the Global Economy Consequences of budget processes inherent in government procurement often lead to delays of programs, reduction of the original capability of programs, or the outright cancellation of such programs. However, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">as requirements for war fighting that inherently incorporate next-generation systems like communications-on-the-move (COTM) capabilities need to become more integrated in a defense network umbrella, delays, cutbacks or cancellations impede</span> or even handicap <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">a nation’s ability to project power.</span> The current state of the global economy certainly puts into question many priorities in terms of civil needs and military needs. On balance, as a new administration takes the reigns of power in the United States, it puts priorities in serving America’s needs while protecting the safety and interests of its citizens at home and abroad. Spending for civil priorities at home such as a jobs creation program that address immediate needs will likely take precedence over next-generation military programs. Bandwidth requirements for the U.S. Military may seem a minor consideration as funds for bank and auto industry bailouts among others are debated in the U.S. Congress. The scale as well as the priority by which other industries is put ahead of programs including military resource build-up leads to alternative thinking that should address both budget savings and resource improvement in light of the current economic turmoil the U.S. and the globe has to undergo within the next year or two. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">An idea that has been regularly discussed in light of budget considerations is to host a government or military payload on a commercial satellite</span>. Dual-use programs for use by both commercial and government clients have actually been in existence and have worked quite well for other governments like Australia and South Korea. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Will hosted payloads or dual-use satellite systems work just as well for the U.S. Military, the largest government entity that uses commercial satellite bandwidth</span>? And will other nations continue to practice hosted payload arrangements or will their own technical requirements lead to proprietary satellite program deployment as well? Military and Government demand for Commercial Satellite Services Reliance on commercial satellite assets is now a foregone conclusion and will remain a key component of U.S. and international government/military strategies for the foreseeable future. Commercial satellite operators, specifically Intelsat, Eutelsat and SES Global, have accounted for a large percentage of U.S. Military leases and their government arms see continued growth in both transponder uptake and revenue streams for services over the near term. But as mentioned earlier, even with admission from the Pentagon that a bandwidth gap exists and is likely growing, Intelsat, Eutelsat and SES have not disclosed plans to launch satellites over the globe’s hotspots like Iraq and Afghanistan. Once again, government procurement as seen historically is unlike video customers that sign leases over the long term. Interviews by NSR with these operators point to the fact that the U.S. Government seems to be more open to a closer partnership. Whether these discussions lead to long term leases capacity on or to put payloads on commercial satellites will depend on contract vehicles over the next few years//<span style="font-size: 16px;">. It is quite apparent from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) itself that even with the launch of its own proprietary assets, net-centric warfare will require bandwidth that is at least twice the capability of the WGS constellation</span>//. An inflection point in 2010 (see curve above) is foreseen by the Pentagon where a sudden surge of demand from less than 20 [gigabytes per second] Gbps of capacity surges to over 30 Gbps of demand by 2012, jumping further to approach 50 Gbps by 2019. Currently, the Pentagon’s answer to its bandwidth shortfall is to outsource what it needs to commercial satellite operators. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The DoD has outlined commercial bandwidth needs by frequency and by region of the globe until 2019</span> [2]. Historically, the largest cost of commercial outsourcing as seen in Figure 3 to the U.S. Military has been bandwidth, accounting for 87% of all spending form 2000-2005. The next line item, equipment purchases, account for a mere 4% of total spending. In its own projections, NSR adheres to the U.S. Military’s view that indeed, the Pentagon will have little choice but to outsource capacity to commercial operators [1<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">]. However, the launch of new internal capacity should have some effect on commercial demand such that developments in equipment and frequency will have to move form commercial to proprietary developments</span>. Moreover, the call for withdrawal of troops in Iraq as well as the budget crunch in the U.S. should further lead to decreasing commercial bandwidth demand in the near term. Commercial capacity demand by the U.S. Military should diminish but not disappear. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The commercial market in terms of bandwidth demand has likely peaked in 2008 and will likely begin to decline until 2014</span> before growing at positive levels once again beginning in 2015. Militaries and civil government agencies have outsourced bandwidth requirements on traditional commercial C-band and Ku-band transponders, as well as X-band that fall under the exclusive use of non-commercial customers. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">In the future, commercial Ka-band transponders are expected to be used more extensively by government customers</span> as well. The growth of commercially outsourced bandwidth has been steady since 2003 for both U.S. and non-U.S. government users. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">As applications and communications requirements grow over time and commercially outsourced bandwidth begin to be integrated more fully in Netcentric warfare, security requirements that may not be at the level that the U.S. Military may be used to have to be addressed</span>. And therein lies one of the challenges of incorporating commercial capacity that puts into question whether it is indeed compelling to dual-use or hosted payload solutions as a sound and/or viable option for the U.S. and other military entities around the globe. Issues with Hosted Payloads Militaries have invested on highly expensive systems and paid very high premiums due to requirements that are oftentimes not met by commercial bandwidth resources. Uppermost in the minds of military users are the following requirements. • Security • Reliability • Availability • Cost The current and planned resources of the U.S. Military have the following attributes: • Defense Satellite Communications System DSCS satellites use super-high frequencies for secure, jam-proof voice and data communications among defense officials, battlefield commanders, ground troops, aircraft, ships, the White House and the State Department. They also carry space operations communications and early warning data. • Wideband Gapfiller Satellite (WGS), the replacement to DSCS, provides greater capability and bandwidth than all the DSCS satellites combined while keeping security and other features intact for X-band and Ka-band. • The constellation of Milstar satellites provide secure, jam resistant, worldwide communications in EHF, linking command authorities with ships, submarines, aircraft and ground stations. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Milstars are the most secure of the various communications satellites. They resist jamming and are hardened against nuclear attack</span>. Milstars can operate in any combat environment with a low probability of detection or interception. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">• The AEHF constellation is the successor to Milstar. The physics of the AEHF waveform make the satellites well suited for strategic communications in a nuclear stressed environment</span>. The tight beam is an enormous benefit to tactical and special operations units due to the low probability of detection and interception. • Mobile User Operational Satellite (MUOS), a next-generation constellation will not be affected by weather, environmental constraints or foliage in UHF. Under the new system, even troops in the most remote locations or buildings with no satellite access would see a big increase in communications capabilities. • Finally, TSAT, which has an Advanced Polar System (APS), will support strategic and national users in the polar region in EHF. The APS is designed to withstand nuclear attacks and support the strategic mission with uninterrupted service. These satellites introduce the use of jam-resistant laser crosslinks for interconnection. Of all the issues that are paramount in the military’s mind, cost is the one component that provides a distinct disadvantage when proprietary military systems are assessed against commercial services. The next-generation satellites planned for the U.S. Military as noted above <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">– WGS, AEHF, MUOS and TSAT – have had cost overruns as well as delays in delivery. And here, the case for hosted payloads is perhaps the most compelling when cost considerations become increasingly important as government budgets</span>, due to economic turmoil, are stressed. Military Proprietary Satellites Programs: An update The current generation of military satellite systems for the U.S. Department of Defense is about to reach their end of life. Next-generation systems such as the WGS, AEHF and MUOS are likely to be deployed within the next several years. In fact, the first WGS satellite was launched in October 2007 and is currently operational for use by the U.S. Pacific Command. Other governments are likewise deploying proprietary military assets that add to the resources of allied militaries around the globe. However, there are two issues that have haunted military procurement that once again favor the case for hosted payloads. - Speed to Deployment: The schedule for deploying next-generation assets has been delayed, which led to commercial outsourcing in terms of bandwidth needs for Iraq and Afghanistan. Continued activities in these countries will likely put pressure on commercially available capacity covering these two countries. More importantly, another flashpoint around the globe such as a new hotspot in the Middle East, South Asia or the Horn of Africa will strain available commercial bandwidth sources further. - Cost and Funding issues: As mentioned earlier, cost and funding issues continue to haunt next-generation satellite deployment. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">TSAT has been a victim of budget cuts where the constellation was originally planned or scheduled to be launched around the 2012-2014 period but has now been postponed for 2019</span>. It is thus easy to speculate that the program may ultimately be cancelled due to funding shortfalls. In a more recent development, it was announced earlier this year that technical issues encountered during testing and the need to swap out some faulty components have delayed the U.S. Air Force's first AEHF satellite and added some $259 million to the program's overall cost. The AEHF program's cost grew significantly in 2008 after Congress, concerned about the Air Force's ability to deliver TSAT on schedule, directed the service to buy a fourth satellite in the series. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Although the third AEHF satellite was expected to cost $939 million, restarting production to build the fourth will cost $2.6 billion,</span> according to a Sept. 30, 2008 Pentagon acquisition cost summary [3]. The addition of the fourth satellite brought <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the total estimated cost of the AEHF program to $9.9 billion,</span> triggering a mandatory recertification of the program by the Pentagon. The Figure 5 above and 6 below shows the aggregate total capacity from programs such as WGS, MUOS, AEHF and TSAT, among many more that are currently expected to enter into service in the next six years [1]. This information comes from various official and historical data sources and U.S. and international programs manufacturer contacted by NSR. The figures above show a large addition of capacity for proprietary systems around the globe. This is dominated by the U.S. Military with the launch of WGS, MUOS, and AEHF and included in the chart is TSAT as well, although the TSAT program may be rescheduled or cancelled. Host government/military payloads on commercial satellites – a recap In 2003, the Optus and Defense C1 satellite was launched, carrying a mixed payload that now serves the needs of Singtel Optus Pty Limited and the Australian Department of Defense for Australia, New Zealand and East Asia. The satellite operates in four frequency bands: • Commercial services in Ku-band for Singtel Optus • Military communications at UHF, X-band and Ka-band for the Australian Department of Defense. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Optus uses C1's Ku-band payload to distribute video, DTH, telephony and Internet connections to remote areas. For the Australian Department of Defense, the satellite's Kaband payload provides high-data rate broadcast coverage</span> for video, voice and data communications. The satellite’s X-band provides medium-to-high data rate voice and data for land and maritime applications. And finally, the UHF payload provides secure low-rate voice and data communications to mobile platforms. In Asia, South Korea launched its first civil-military dual-use communication satellite in August 2006, a move that introduced cutting-edge warfare systems in its overall capability. The dual-use satellite carries 12 military relay terminals and 24 commercial terminals, whereby the 12 military relays are capable of covering troop communications from the Malacca Strait to the Central Pacific sea areas. Prior to the satellite’s launch, the South Korean military relied on ground-based communication systems; however, the system using underground military cables or microwave relay towers was vulnerable to enemy attack. The dual-use satellite system has been successful thus far such that South Korea plans to deploy a total of 20 satellites, including eight multipurpose satellites, by 2015 [Koreasat]. One of the key benefits of dual use systems include reduced costs compared to internal asset build-up. A case in point is the recent budget challenges faced by the U.S. Military’s TSAT program, which took a serious hit in FY2009. This will have a dramatic impact on U.S. Military capabilities as the bandwidth the U.S. had planned on owning internally will be drastically reduced within the time frame set forth in the original schedule of the program. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Dual-use systems or hosted payloads that also draw on commercial customers cost a fraction of proprietary assets</span>. To illustrate, U.S. Military procurement of military satellites costs run in the billions of US dollars, while hosted payloads or dual-use satellites such as Australia’s Optus and Defense C1 cost $500 million. Even with payload and bus enhancements, where the costs of which are shared with the commercial operator or partner, the total price tag is far below deploying and owning a proprietary military system. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The other benefit of dual use or hosted payloads is the speed by which assets are deployed.</span> Even if TSAT were to be deployed based on the original scope of five satellites, the delays that are now expected to take place, where first launch has been moved from 2013 to 2016 at the earliest, means that bandwidth planning and systems capability will have to likewise be delayed. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Barring other available alternatives, commercial outsourcing will once again have to take up the slack.</span> These considerations appear to be in full view of the U.S. Military’s system planners. In July 2008, AGS (the U.S. government services affiliate of SES Global) announced that it was awarded a contract by the U.S. Air Force to host an experimental sensor on board a commercial spacecraft. The three-year $65 million firm fixed price contract will host the experimental sensor on board an SES AMERICOM spacecraft scheduled to be launched in 2010 and will operate over the United States. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The program, known as the Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload (CHIRP) Flight Demonstration Program, will have the primary purpose of testing a new type of infrared sensor from geo-synchronous altitude</span>. The passive infrared sensor will be integrated onto a commercial satellite so that it can be launched into orbit, and the data can then be transmitted to the ground for analysis. Although the CHIRP program is for experimental purposes only and also not designed to address the communications mission and bandwidth shortfall faced by the U.S. Military, one cannot help but ponder whether the next line of contracts coming from the U.S. Government will be for dual use satellites similar to the Australia and South Korean models or for hosted payloads. It seems that the move is catching on as the 2009 Budget Request of the US. Navy included $42M over the next two years for a UHF satcom hosted payload to serve as an interim while the transition from the Ultra High Frequency Operational satellite (UFO) to the MUOS constellations take place. This would be a small prototype UHF payload to be outfitted as a secondary payload on an existing commercial spacecraft design. The Request for Proposal has been issued and the launch is expected in 2011 after a selection in late 2009. The impetus is there, having granted a contract to SES and discussions are more prevalent from both the military side as well as the commercial operator side. For the military, cost and speed provide compelling arguments to deploy a dual-use or hosted payload satellite system. For commercial satellite operators, cost-sharing, long-term contracting and an anchored tenant provide invaluable benefits in a business that is inherently risky given the 15-year life of the asset. This may mean that new and innovative procurements to provide capacity to bridge military customers needs is becoming a recognized acquisition procedure. However, technical concerns will still have to be addressed in order to ensure full reliability of the system. These issues and concerns include: Technical Attributes • Frequency coordination issues • Interference issues • Performance issues Technical Concerns • On the commercial operator side, will the hosted payload interfere with the operation of the satellite? • On the military side, will the commercial payload limit the performance of the military hosted payload? • Will the military customer accept that a commercial operator, with a larger stake in-orbit on the same platform take precedence and control over the satellite, hence its payload? Easy Retrofit or Large-scale Re-engineering • From a satellite manufacturer’s point of view, is a hosted payload system where the U.S. Military will have high technical requirements lead to wide-scale system’s development? • Will delivery time be impacted by the military payload? The Bottom Line In 2008, Pentagon leaders disclosed that non-traditional conflicts such as the insurgents and terrorists facing coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan will be the main military battlefields for years to come. The classified Pentagon assessment likewise concluded that the U.S. Military in many respects including its bandwidth resources is prevented from improving its ability to respond to any new crisis such as potential outbreaks in North Korea, Iran, Lebanon or China. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Hosted payloads provide </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">a vehicle by which cost savings and speed of deployment are enabled by the commercial sector. Faced with the difficult current economic environment and the limited ability of the U.S. Government to allocate funds for next-generation space programs, hosted payloads may be the answer in addressing urgent requirements in order to maintain and even improve its war fighting capability in terms of fully developing “Netcentricity</span>//.”



**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">And, continuing reliance upon commercial leasing will only increase vulnerability</span>**

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Thompson ‘10</span> (Loren B. Thompson, Chief Operating Officer of the Lexington Institute, former Professor and Deputy Director of the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University, Ph.D., M.A., Government, Georgetown University, B.S., Political Science, Northeastern University, “Lack Of Protected Satellite Communications Could Mean Defeat For Joint Force In Future War,” 4-14-2010, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/lack-of-protected-satellite-communications-could-mean-defeat-for-joint-force-in-future-war?a=1&c=1171]]</span>)

In the years since the Cold War ended, the U.S. military has become heavily dependent upon satellite communications to maintain its global connectivity. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Without such links, it would be difficult for the military to operate in a coordinated fashion or exchange information critical to situational awareness</span><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[home#_msocom_1|[K1]]</span>] . Defense experts have repeatedly warned that <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the availability of space-based communications could be compromised in future conflicts by the fact that 80-90% of all military traffic is transmitted on vulnerable commercial satcom channels</span>. However, there is a related problem that far fewer military observers have noticed: <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">only about 1% of defense communications today are protected against even the most modest jamming threats</span>. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Jamming means overloading key frequencies with so much electronic "noise" that communications cannot get through to intended destinations. </span>It's a simple process in the case of unprotected satellite links, because signals are relatively weak after traveling 22,000 miles from transponders in geosynchronous orbit -- <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the orbit that communications satellites must maintain in order to serve as "stationary" links above particular points on the Earth's surface (they aren't really stationary</span>, but they appear to be because their rotation matches that of the Earth//<span style="font-size: 16px;">). If the satellites were any closer to Earth they would zoom across the surface at a speed of several miles per second, making them unavailable as communications nodes most of the time. So they must sit 22,000 miles above sea level</span>//, which makes their signals easy to overwhelm with modest amounts of electromagnetic interference, especially if the jammer is near communications receivers. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The only satellite constellation the military is currently building that can provide protection against the full array of potential communications threats is the Advanced Extremely High Frequency</span> (AEHF<span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[home#_msocom_2|[K2]]</span>] ) system. AEHF is designed to cope with everything from jammers to hackers to scintillation from thermonuclear explosions. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">However, although it will provide ten times as much capacity as the legacy MilStar constellation, it can only carry a small portion of the military communications traffic passing through space portals. As a result, the amount of that traffic that is well protected against jamming will peak at 6-7%</span> in fiscal year 2012, leaving over 90% of joint-force transmissions vulnerable to degradation. That's not a serious problem if the biggest threats we face are rag-tag adversaries such as the Taliban, but <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">in a war with China there's a high likelihood that America's military would lose the use of most of its satcom links in places like the Western Pacific.</span> The Bush Administration had an initiative for addressing this problem called the Transformational Communications Satellite program, or TSAT. TSAT would have provided internet-like access to U.S. warfighters all over the world, including troops on the move, from a constellation of five very capable satellites. However, TSAT was canceled last year due to astronomical (no pun intended) costs, and now <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the military space community has no real plan for assuring that a reasonable portion of joint-force communications traffic will be protected against jamming</span><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[home#_msocom_3|[K3]]</span>] in the future. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">The feasible, affordable answer is not to begin a new program, but to start incrementally evolving AEHF towards a more robust capability</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">.</span>// I argued in Space News several years ago that such an approach was more likely to work out than trying to implement the complex TSAT initiative, but at the time everybody in the business was still chasing the TSAT opportunity. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Now that it's gone, military planners need to start thinking about how the government can leverage its investment in AEHF through incremental improvements to each new satellite</span>. If that move is not made soon, our warfighters may one day face an adversary who knows how to isolate them from the rest of the joint force and then kill them.





**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">AEHF constellation critical to successful ISR – makes is effective even post-nuclear war</span>**

Jim <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Hodges</span>, Global Military Analyst for C4ISR Journal, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">10</span> [“Out of sync U.S. Air Force copes with delays on nuclear control terminals for bombers”, C4ISR Journal, July 1, http://www.c4isrjournal.com/story.php?F=4640624]

Seven years ago, the U.S. Air Force awarded a contract to develop a new kind of communications terminal as a linchpin in the service’s plan to assure command and control of the country’s nuclear-armed bombers during a nuclear war. The Family of Aerial Beyond-line-of-sight Terminals <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">(FAB-T) would link bomber crews to the forthcoming constellation of Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF</span>) communications satellites, which the Air Force is almost ready to start launching to replace the Milstar nuclear command-and-control satellites. In a nuclear war, ground antennas would be knocked out, the U.S. president would take to the air in a mobile command post, and FAB-T computers on the bombers would become the president’s last link to the bombers. The president does not have that kind of satellite link today because B-2 and B-52 bombers do not carry Milstar terminals. “The nuclear C2 community has required this capability since the launch of Milstar, and FAB-T is the solution,” said Air Force Lt. Col. Mark Davis, commander of the squadron that oversees the FAB-T work at Hanscom Air Force Base, Mass. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The AEHF constellation also might be the only communications network available after nuclear detonations, and bomber crews would use the FAB-T terminals to take over command and control of the constellation. </span>In better times, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the higher data rates of the AEHF</span>satellites and FAB-T equipment <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">would improve dissemination of intelligence to bombers and to and from ISR aircraft,</span> such the RC-135. With the first AEHF satellite scheduled for launch in September, contractors and the Air Force are working through a major hitch in the FAB-T plan. Development of the terminals is years behind schedule, and in June the Air Force issued a notice to industry announcing that it will conduct “market research” toward finding an alternative supplier for the terminals, which are in development by Boeing. As it stands, the Air Force will not decide until 2012 whether to begin production, a decision that was originally planned for 2007, and then February 2010. Software problems The Government Accountability Office, in an October report, cited “significant software development problems” by Boeing. GAO said the AEHF and FAB-T programs are prime examples of space programs that are in desperate need of schedule “synchronization” between satellite construction and development of user equipment and software. It calculates that just 2 percent of the FAB-T terminals will be ready when AEHF is declared operationally capable, which is defined as two satellites operating in orbit. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">After the September launch, the Air Force plans to launch two more AEHFs through 2012</span>. The FAB-T delay does not mean no one will be able to use AEHF, however. Other engineers are upgrading software for the Army Secure Mobile Anti-jam Reliable Tactical Terminal, known as SMART-T, and the Navy Multiband Terminal to make them compatible with AEHF. The Air Force is upgrading its Minuteman Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network to assure AEHF links to missile commanders. As for the airborne terminals, a Boeing official said the company understands the GAO criticism. “That’s one thing we have to do: synchronize with the satellites,” said Kirk Warburton, who heads business development for FAB-T for Boeing. Without production terminals, Boeing last year delivered engineering model FAB-Ts to the Air Force’s B-2, B-52 and RC-135 programs, and to Hanscom. Tests on a Boeing 707 test bed at Hanscom went well, but they were conducted with low-data-rate terminals because software to exploit the AEHF Extended Data Rate waveform was not ready. “The System Development and Demonstration Program is going to be complete, but we’re in the process of replanning the schedule,” Warburton said. “We’re in reprogramming, aligning the schedule with the capabilities.” <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">If the first AEHF satellite goes up as planned</span>, the Air Force hopes to test an engineering version of FAB-T with it late this year, said Davis of Hanscom. GAO, in 2009, warned against testing with “an interim, nonproduction-representative” terminal, and Warburton said Boeing is addressing that problem. “We’re completing the qualification for the hardware and the qualification of the Block 8 software, which is going to be the production [Extended Data Rate] software,” he said. Boeing is forging ahead on its terminals, which are an amalgamation that includes a modem processor by L-3 Communications, AEHF waveform management by Northrop Grumman, and communications and information security by ViaSat. The Air Force’s move to postpone a decision on low-rate initial production until 2012 was to allow development to catch up. It also will allow much more testing, including tests to determine if the FAB-T can interact with the other terminals of the AEHF network. Full-implementation of FAB–T will involve 243 terminals and might take until 2019 to complete. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The AEHF constellation would replace Milstar’s low data rate of 2,400 bytes-per-second with up to eight megabytes on multiple channels. </span>When defense officials outlined the user equipment for AEHF, they decided on software upgrades to the SMART-T and Navy terminals. The Air Force is developing the Minuteman Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network upgrade for ground use. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">But the new AEHF satellite offered something else: An opportunity to develop a radiation-hardened, aircraft-qualified terminal to provide faster voice and data transmission to the bombers and RC-135 intelligence planes and, after that, to the E-4B, the converted Boeing 747 that would serve as a mobile command post for the national command authority in a nuclear war</span>. A FAB-T terminal eventually would be installed on the Navy’s E-6B, an airborne command post and communications center. The E-4s and E-6s have Milstar terminals, but the bombers do not. “You need to know that if you send a B-2 on a nuclear mission, and it comes time to recall it, that you can reach out anywhere in the world and deliver that message,” Warburton said. The Air Force established that as a priority: “Several years ago, it was determined that the most critical need was for survivable communications for the nuclear force elements, airborne and ground command posts and AEHF satellite control,” Davis said. In 2003, Boeing won a $273 million, six–year design and development contract to produce FAB-T. It would use layered and open architecture and a software-defined-radio approach with an eye to future technology development. “For instance, externally developed components can be used with the same core hardware/software, and that enables platforms like the B-2 to develop their own antenna and operate interface, per its own needs and still be linked to the FAB-T core,” Davis said. “The architecture employs common modules along the terminal configurations, simplifying the logistics effort for the enterprise.” But since 2003, engineering changes related to both hardware and software have more than trebled development costs and delayed production, according to GAO’s October report. In a March report, “Assessment of Major Weapons Programs,” GAO warns that the troubles might not be over. The Air Force FAB-T office “continues to monitor two areas — certification by the National Security Agency and software development — that could cause cost increases and schedule delays,” according to the report. FAB-T designers have had to increase the amount of software code by about 8 percent over the last year, and software costs have risen by 12 percent, according to the report. Warburton, who has been on the program less than two years, spoke of the difficulty involved in development. “The government has set up a set of requirements to provide a set of terminals that are hardened” — meaning engineered to resist nuclear radiation — “for the nuclear control mission, which is a lot tougher than delivering nonhardened terminals,” he said. “And, by the way, they must be secure all the way up through top secret, because you can imagine that the nuclear command and control mission is classified all the way to the highest levels.” Boeing is looking ahead toward the 2012 decision on low-rate initial production. “Based on a schedule the Air Force gave us [in January], we will give them a proposal for how we would do the first lots of low-rate initial production, because that’s all they’re going to be asking for,” Warburton said. What happens beyond that “is dependent on how they lay out their funding.” At the same time, Boeing continues to work on future increments of the FAB-T program, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">to take advantage of its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, the better to exploit the data-transmission speed of the AEHF satellites. “The RC-135 will incorporate FAB-T to provide a protected and beyond-line-of-sight capability to rapidly and securely pass ISR to ground sites</span>,” Davis said. ”//<span style="font-size: 16px;">AEHF is an important segment of the </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">suite of communications system used by the ISR community.</span>//”

John J. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Garstka</span>, assistant director for concepts and operations in the Office of Force Transformation, Office of the Secretary of Defense. He has spoken and written extensively on the topic of warfare in the information age, 20<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">03</span> [“Network-Centric Warfare Offers Warfighting Advantage”, Signal Online, May, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=235&zoneid=62]]</span>, mcG]

<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Datalinks are the new weapon of the information age</span>. The term network-centric warfare broadly describes the combination of emerging tactics, techniques and procedures that a networked force can employ to create a decisive warfighting advantage. According to John Keegan, author of A History of Warfare, it is similar to the significant warfighting developments of the industrial age and agrarian age in that <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">network-centric warfare seeks to exploit an order of magnitude change in an underlying source of power to increase warfighting advantage dramatically.</span>Paula Kaufman, in an article she wrote for IEEE Spectrum, agrees with this opinion<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">. In the industrial age, power was primarily derived from mass and the sources of power for moving mass. In the information age, power is increasingly derived from information sharing, information access and speed,</span> she says. The advantages network-centric warfare brings to the battlespace are particularly relevant to the tactical and operational levels of war, but they impact all levels of military activity from the tactical to the strategic. Although <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the construct of an information advantage may seem somewhat intangible, it can be measured, and its impact on military operations can be evaluated in terms of mission effectiveness, survivability and lethality</span>—coins of the realm used by warfighters across the ages. Evidence of the power of network-centric warfare accumulated from a wide range of activities, including combat operations, training events, exercises and demonstrations, continues to strengthen and reinforce its existing tenets. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">A U.S. Defense Department 2001 report to Congress about network-centric warfare enumerates several specific points: A robustly networked force improves information sharing; information sharing and collaboration enhances the quality of information and shared situational awareness; shared situational awareness enables collaboration and self-synchronization and enhances sustainability and speed of command; and these in turn dramatically increase mission effectiveness. </span>Although the margin of victory has varied across mission areas, the outcome has consistently been decisive in favor of forces that are robustly networked. In some tactical engagements, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">superior platforms were decisively defeated by less capable platforms that leveraged the order of magnitude improvement in information sharing that networking enables.</span> In other engagements, digitized and networked ground forces with a reduced number of platforms were able to substitute information for mass and outperform units that had fought with a larger number of platforms not similarly digitized and networked. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Even more impressive, the combination of networked and digitized ground and air forces was able to defeat an opposition force decisively with unprecedented lethality by creating and leveraging an information advantage</span>. Most recently, military operations in support of operation Enduring Freedom highlighted the emergence of near-real-time information sharing as a source of warfighting advantage. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The source of power was not new platforms, but rather the networking of the legacy platforms with special operations forces</span> (SOF). The extent to which ground-based SOF were able to share precision information with command and control aircraft and fighter, bomber and attack aircraft was unprecedented in military operations. It represented an order of magnitude increase in information sharing over what had been previously demonstrated anywhere in the world in combat operations. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Two of the more noteworthy and documented examples of the power of network-centric warfare are drawn from the air-to-air mission. In this mission area, a major contributor to enhanced survivability and lethality is an increase in shared situational awareness</span> and enhanced situational understanding. With audio-only communications, p<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">ilots and controllers must share information</span>generated by onboard sensors about opposing forces as well as their own position and status via voice. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Communicating the minimum essential information required to take offensive or defensive actions takes time, and the resulting situational awareness can often differ significantly from reality</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">In contrast, when datalinks are employed on fighter aircraft, digital information on blue and red forces is shared instantaneously, enabling all participants to share a common tactical picture. This improved information position constitutes a significant information advantage vis-à-vis an adversary fighting with voice-only communications. This information advantage in turn enables a cognitive advantage in the form of dramatically increased shared situational awareness and enhanced situational understanding. The result is that pilots flying datalink-equipped aircraft can achieve much higher levels of shared situational awareness and understanding on a timeline previously unachievable with voice-only communications. They can translate these advantages into increased survivability and lethality. One of the best examples of how networking and digitization can be leveraged to create an information advantage took place in a training exercise in the mid-1990s when Royal Air Force (RAF) Tornado aircraft from U.K. 29 Squadron with tactical datalinks defeated U.S. Air Force F-15Cs with voice-only communications in a series of air-to-air engagements that took place during a red flag exercise in the airspace over the Nellis Air Force Base range. Historically, the most favorable outcome that the absolute best RAF pilots could manage when flying against F-15Cs was a draw. However, when the RAF introduced a datalink in the form of Link-16, U.K. 29 Squadron pilots, flying with new innovative tactics, were able to increase their kill ratio over the F-15C equipped with voice-only communications to approximately 4-to-1. The power of information sharing to increase survivability and lethality in the air-to-air mission was substantiated by the Air Force again in the mid-1990s during a joint tactical information distribution system (JTIDS) operational special project. Air Force pilots flying F-15Cs with and without datalinks clearly demonstrated an order of magnitude increase in information sharing enabled by the datalinks. This operational special project consisted of hundreds of tactical engagements, ranging in size from two-versus-two to eight-versus-16 aircraft, which were conducted during day and night conditions. During the more than 12,000 sorties and more than 19,000 flying hours, the average kill ratio for F-15Cs equipped with datalinks increased by more than 150 percent over F-15Cs fighting with voice-only communications, according to a JTIDS operational special project report to Congress. An analysis of the growing body of evidence highlights a very strong relationship between information advantage, cognitive advantage and increased lethality and survivability at the tactical level. It shows that these relationships are not unique to the air-to-air mission but rather that they were demonstrated first in this mission area as a result of the relative maturity of the application of networking technology in this arena. This same story line of increased warfighting effectiveness enabled by networking has been played out in counter special operations forces mission Fleet Battle Experiment Delta; counter anti-access, Fleet Battle Experiment Foxtrot; multinational rapid reaction forces, Allied Command Europe Mobile Force–Land; and combined arms maneuver warfare, Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I (DCX-I). During DCX-I, the blue force was digitized and networked to an unprecedented degree. Equally important, these forces were highly trained on this digital equipment and in many cases had developed new tactics, techniques and procedures to leverage their improved capability to operate in the information domain.</span> <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The digitized and networked ground forces demonstrated significantly improved warfighting capabilities and were able to prevail over the opposing forces in a number of engagements</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">For example, during one phase of the exercise, the blue force was in a defensive posture with the opposing force moving to contact under the cover of darkness. A significant column of armor was detected by the joint surveillance target attack radar system and positively identified as hostile by a Hunter unmanned aerial vehicle, Col. Fred Stein, USA (Ret.), explains. An analysis of the real-time blue ground picture indicated that the attacking opposing force column was located approximately 10 miles from the brigade combat team’s defensive positions. The brigade commander, in consultation with the division commander, decided to engage the hostile force, and the fire mission was assigned to close air support. At this point, the engagement departed from the usual script, which had been characterized in the past by some as an exercise in futility, according to an internal correspondence from the Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Test Center. F-16s and A/OA-10s of the Arizona Air National Guard equipped with the situational awareness data link (SADL) performed a close-air-support mission. The networking of these aircraft enabled them to exchange real-time targeting information as well as to receive and display a forward trace of the blue ground picture. The result of this networking was more than an order of magnitude improvement in the ability of ground and air forces to share information. In addition to being equipped with SADL, the F-16s were equipped with Lightening II targeting pods and a mixed weapons load of GBU-12s and AGM-65D Mavericks. The Forward Air Controller–Airborne (FAC-A) determined that employing the F-16s as a coordinated pair would maximize combat power. In engaging the ground targets, the A/OA-10 FAC-A identified targets of interest and distributed sensor points of interest over SADL to facilitate sensor cueing by the F-16’s Lightening II targeting pod. Employing these tactics enabled each wave of two-ship pairs to engage tanks selectively and avoid dropping ordnance on less significant targets. The battle damage assessment of the first wave of F-16s was “two battalions rendered combat ineffective.” Follow-on flights of F-16s were equally lethal, according to the Air National Guard correspondence.</span> <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The net result of this engagement was that this phase of the training exercise had to be recocked to enable ground forces to accomplish their training objectives for hasty defense and counterattack successfully, </span>Col. Stein says. This transformation of close air support at night from an exercise in futility to devastatingly effective combat highlights the efficacy of network-centric warfare. The impact of digitization and networking on the combined arms fight, specifically the impact of digital close air support, is described in an Army evaluation of DCX-I. “The National Training Center is a playing field that often humbles the visiting team,” it reports. “However, during the U.S. Army’s Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I, the visiting team, in the form of the U.S. Army’s 4th Infantry Division, supported by elements of the U.S. Air Force, including elements of the Arizona Air National Guard, were able to leverage the power of an order of magnitude increase in information sharing to turn the tables on the opposing forces on at least two occasions. Of particular significance was a devastating defeat of opposing forces at night by F-16 and A/OA-10 aircraft performing the close-air-support mission.” <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Worldwide, militaries are crafting their individual responses to the challenges and opportunities of the information age. They are taking actions that demonstrate an increased understanding of the sources of information age warfighting advantage</span>. A new vocabulary has developed that reflects the subtle variations in underlying strategies and core missions of militaries worldwide. To varying degrees, these actions also are reflected in emerging concepts and doctrine, focused investments in key enablers and well-crafted programs of experimentation. Besides network-centric warfare, currently used by the armed forces of the United States, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, other coined terms include Australia’s network-enabled warfare, the United Kingdom’s network-enabled capability, the Swedish armed forces’ network-based defense and the armed forces of the Republic of Singapore’s knowledge-based command and control. Each of these terms reflects its respective military’s ongoing response to the information age. Clearly, militaries worldwide are continuing to take a close look at network-centric warfare and related concepts for information age warfare. Evidently they like what they see.

<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">One reason A&D companies are sometimes charged with being costly, cumbersome, risk averse and bureaucratic is that they mirror their primary customers</span>. And, inevitably, the <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">periodic attempts to make the process more economical and “commercial-like” fail because this government marketplace is the antithesis of a commercial one</span>. Commercial businesses work in generally open markets, dealing directly with multiple customers empowered to make buying decisions through individual transactions, and with growth largely constrained by anti-trust laws. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">A&D companies are largely dealing with a single customer set comprised of multiple, competing political constituencies, with growth and size limits often set by industrial base considerations.</span> Commercial firms work to a price-based, closed book business model. The market determines what consumers will pay for a particular widget, irrespective of what it costs to make it. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">A&D companies work to a cost-based, open book business model</span>. Cost and price negotiations are governed by the Truth in Negotiation Act (TINA) and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) that lay out every element of contractor cost to be analyzed. To ensure A&D companies are fulfilling their DOD contractual obligations, in 2009 the Defense Contracting Auditing Agency (DCAA) employed 4,000 people with a budget of $433M, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) had 10,000 civilians with a budget of over $1B, and the Office of the Inspector General had 1,475 auditors and a budget of $288M. In addition, there are military service acquisition and program management offices for every program, the Office of the Secretary of Defense acquisition community and Congress’ auditing arm, the General Accountability Office (GAO). The Department of Defense has stated that it will further increase oversight by hiring 20,000 more acquisition professionals, at a time of flattening acquisition budgets. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">A&D companies have to staff their program management, finance, contracts and internal audit functions to service these legally mandated government requirements. Unless a commercial company really messes up</span> (Enron, AIG, BP, Lehman Brothers), <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">it is likely to face limited government oversight. By the very nature of its work, an A&D company lives with significant oversight every day.</span> A commercial company faces very limited controls over most exports; defense exports, quite rightly, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">are by far the most highly regulated of any industrial sector</span>. Each step along the way to a foreign sale of U.S. defense equipment requires its own State Department export license, and each proposed sale over $50M is subject to Congressional review. As of 2010, there are literally tens of thousands of active licenses that govern how A&D companies approach the international marketplace. And finally, a commercial company’s product life cycles are largely driven by consumer demand. Some products go gang-busters for years while others simply go bust. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">For A&D companies, program life cycles are driven by the vagaries of annual budgeting and appropriations processes, changing threats, requirements, and philosophies, program performance and, in some cases, political whims. The business consequences can occasionally be surreal, and the military impacts consequential. </span>

<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">NCO is highly dependent on the interoperability of communications equipment, data, and software to enable networking of people, sensors, and manned and unmanned platforms</span>. Parts of NCO technology rely on lineof-sight radio transmission for microwave or infrared signals, or laser beams. Other parts of the technology aggregate information for transmission through larger network trunks for global distribution via fiber optic cables, microwave towers, or both lowaltitude and high-altitude satellites. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The designs for this technology must enable rapid communications between individuals in all services, and rapid sharing of data and information between mobile platforms and sensors used by all military services</span>.60 The <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">architectures must also have the ability to dynamically self-heal and re-form the network when one or more communications nodes are interrupted. DOD officials have noted that the new military Global Information Grid (GIG) must be also designed to interoperate securely with the networks of other organizations outside of DOD</span>, including state and local governments, multinational military commands, and the commercial and research communities.61<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Some observers question whether the U.S. military can achieve true network and systems interoperability among all services. DOD reportedly intends to integrate the architectures of network systems used by all branches of the military to create a network centric capability linked to the GIG</span>(seesectionbelow). Tohelpaccomplish this integration, the <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">DOD Joint Staff has created a new Force Capability Board (FCB) to monitor NCO programs for mismatches in funding, or mismatches in capability</span>. When an issue is detected, the FCB reports to the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, which then provides guidance during budget deliberations at the Pentagon.62



**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Satellite Vulnerability leads china to act offensively in space – triggers war over Taiwan </span>**

During the recent Iraq war, 68% of munitions were satellite guided, a massive increase from the merely 10% of satellite guided munitions used in the 1991 Iraq War.199 One senior Air Force officer said that thanks to satellite technology the U.S. no longer fights in the fog of war, but in a “huge cloud of electrons.”200 However, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">because four-fifths of America’s military data is transmitted through unhardened commercial satellites, and a single Global Hawk unmanned surveillance drone flying over the middle east can consume several times more bandwidth than was used in the whole of the 1991 war against Iraq, Air Force officers commonly describe space as being America’s “Achilles Heel</span>.”201 Referring to China’s ASAT test, General Hamel of the Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center said “//<span style="font-size: 16px;">if they take </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">our asymmetric advantage in space, we go from an information age war machine to an industrial age war machine…shifting the balance, the edge will go to the adversary</span>//.” Many specialists also argue that aside from the U.S. military dependency on orbital space, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the U.S. economy, and in turn, much of the world economy, is also rapidly becoming dependent on space-based system</span>s. They posit that, in effect, the U.S. is now a “space faring” nation whose very way of life is tied to the myriad capabilities provided by the orbital space medium.203 War games conducted as part of U.S. national security protocols, such as the Army-After-Next, Navy Global and Air Force Global Engagement series, Space Game 2 and Schriever 1 & 2, as well as the privately conducted “DEADSATS” war games, conducted from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, confirm this view. According to some space experts who were intimately involved with the war games, the exercises exposed “a critical national Achilles heel that politicians, economists and corporate CEOs have largely ignored…<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">losses in space can quickly affect the economic, social, and national security fabric not only of the united States, but of the entire world</span>.”204 These experts further speculate that “<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">large military powers,” such as the United States, could “be held hostage by the unknowns inherent in a new kind of war.</span>”205 <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">These concerns are directly linked with China’s ASAT threat and their potential applicability in any future U.S.-Sino conflict. Clearly any possible U.S. military contingency in the Taiwan Straits would require secure satellites as the U.S. becomes ever more reliant upon its space systems</span>. Moreover, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">reconnaissance satellites are thought to limit the risk inherent in the build-up of forces that both the PRC and the U.S. could be expected to deploy to the region in the event of a crisis</span>.206 However, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">if the U.S. was blinded as the result of a preemptive Chinese ASAT attack, the conflict could quickly escalate to a dangerous level</span>//. According to two experts on the subject, “if there is a great- power war in the twenty-first century, our crystal ball says that it will be between the United States and China over Taiwan, with a very serious potential for a horrible escalatory process.”207 This underscores the gravity of the topic as well as the negative impact the Chinese shift towards fielding counter-space weapons could have.





**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">PLA is Building up it’s forces to target US ISR vulnerabilities – gives China upper hand in conflict</span>**

Alexander <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Neill</span>, head of the Asia Security Programme at the Royal United Services Institute, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">11</span> [“Viewpoint: A new Sino-US high-tech arms race?”, BBC News, Jan 11, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-asia-pacific-12154991]

Beneath the veneer of official smiles and neatly choreographed handshakes at the defence summit in Beijing, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the Sino-US relationship remains fraught with uncertainty</span>. A year after military relations were frozen by Beijing in the wake of a $6.4bn (£4.1bn) arms package to Taiwan, the US request for a resumption of a substantial strategic dialogue has been given a lukewarm reception in Beijing. The People's Liberation Army's (PLA) appetite for engagement with the US has waned considerably over the last year. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Cementing its defence arrangement with Taiwan, and holding large-scale naval war games in China's back yard in recent months, the US has buttressed its alliances with its East Asian allies. These actions have fuelled resentment in China and fears of US military encirclement. US irritation is based on a recent spate of harassment by the PLA Navy and Chinese fishing vessels against the US Navy and its allies in the West Pacific</span>. The US is also frustrated with China's intransigence towards meaningful strategic dialogue on international security concerns, particularly while tension on the Korean peninsula remains high and nuclear proliferation by North Korea continues unchecked. But the Pentagon's visceral concern is its failure to detect the break-neck speed of Chinese military technological advances and its ability to curb an arms race in East Asia. 'Pressure point warfare' Despite recent headlines reporting the appearance of a Chinese stealth fighter prototype, of more concern to US military planners is the enabling technology that will produce the bite to China's military bark. This angst is focused on China's decade-long programme of military "informationisation" designed to leap-frog over US capabilities in the Pacific region. <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">The PLA is rapidly developing asymmetric warfare techniques against US command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance infrastructure, known as "C4ISR" in military parlance. </span>For China, with its inferior conventional military capabilities, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">the key to gaining the upper hand in a conflict with the US is to gain dominance of the space theatre and to damage its digital nerve system</span>. China views space as a corner-stone of its future prosperity: a mandate from heaven for China's growth and military strength. For this reason, China is working hard to counter the Pentagon's monopoly in space and to build its own space-based deterrent. The <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">PLA's</span> doctrine of "pressure point warfare", a multi-layered approach using space, cyberspace and information operations alongside conventional capabilities is designed to cripple an adversary in one swift strike. This fast paced and high-tech military modernisation has led to the emergence of weapons systems and technology, which in certain theatres has <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">closed the military capability gap with the US considerably. These include directed energy, jamming and cyber attack technologies, designed to paralyse the US military machine</span>. The PLA has recently developed and successfully tested advanced anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons systems, demonstrating it can destroy or manoeuvre close to enemy satellites in space. ASAT weapons are part of a new genre of "assassin's mace" or surprise weapons aimed at the Pentagon's Achilles Heel in space and cyberspace. All of these capabilities require state of the art signals processing and communications systems, technology which China has been developing indigenously to create its own command and control architecture. Carrier fears <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">One of the most pressing concerns for the United States navy is the prospect of US aircraft carriers and other vessels being denied access to theatres of operation in the event that the US were dragged into a conflict over Taiwan or in support of its other Pacific allies.</span> Coined by Pentagon planners as China's "A2/AD" (Anti Access/Area Denial) strategy, the PLA would attempt to prevent US aircraft carriers from deploying to theatre, targeted by Chinese torpedoes, Cruise Missiles and Anti Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBMs). <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">PLA tacticians know that a successful strike against a moving US aircraft carrier requires advanced space-based targeting assets and an ability to penetrate the US ballistic missile defence umbrella</span>.

One of the defining aspects of today’s military environment is that <span style="font-size: 16px;">the Untied States has moved well beyond joint operations.</span> Today’s <span style="font-size: 16px;">operations are fully integrated with key interagency</span>, state and local government, alliance, coalition, host nation, international, and nongovernmental organizations and actors. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Each of these actors generally operates on its own distinct networ</span>k, <span style="font-size: 16px;">although</span> sustained <span style="font-size: 16px;">operations</span> during the past decade in the Balkans and now in Iraq and Afghanistan <span style="font-size: 16px;">have led to the development of tools and arrangements for information sharing</span>and collaboration. <span style="font-size: 16px;">These efforts, however, have often been ad hoc and have not allowed for the true integration of all elements of national and international power.Because future contingencies will almost certainly require collaboration of U.S. forces with interagency, coalition, and nongovernmental actors</span>, <span style="font-size: 16px;">DOD must work to improve and institutionalize its ability to work effectively with partners in all stages of combat</span>, stabilization, and reconstruction. <span style="font-size: 16px;">CENTRIXS</span>, for example, <span style="font-size: 16px;">has been the vehicle for collaboration</span> between U.S. and coalition forces during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. CENTRIXS has been successful in many ways, <span style="font-size: 16px;">but it is limited. It does address information sharing with non-military partners, because it will not allow for U.S. and coalition forces to plan and operate on the same network.</span> Although <span style="font-size: 16px;">it is vital for operational security reasons that U.S. forces maintain this firewall between U.S. military networks</span>and the networks of coalition (with the partial exception of the United Kingdom and Australia) and non-military partners, it is equally vital that the department work to find ways to improve the current situation in this area. Technical solutions will be helpful in this regard, but policy and process solutions are likely to be of equal or greater importance.

The <span style="font-size: 16px;">United States military steadily transformed during the latter part of the 20th century by an ever increasing reliance on information</span>networks and their ability to provide wider access to information and to support collaboration. Impressive gains in the usability, usefulness and availability of all forms of information have improved the effectiveness of military operations. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Our increasing ability to leverage information and networking will be a critical enabling factor in developing better ways to work with others in the USG and with both coalition and nontraditional partners</span> as we, collectively, undertake the challenging missions of the 21“ Century. Today a Company Commander can control a Division’s worth of ﬁrepower, tagging and tracking systems promise to signiﬁcantly improve the logistics chain and the improved availability of intelligence information and greater connectivity between sensors and shooters has increased the effectiveness of our forces and enhanced their security. During the past ten years, <span style="font-size: 16px;">we have seen the evolution of military missions driven by adaptive adversaries who recognize our increasing dependence on information networks.</span> Going forward, transfonnation must focus on addressing the stresses imposed by <span style="font-size: 16px;">21“ Century mission challenges associated with stabilization and reconstruction operations in urban and unconventional enviromnents</span> and responses to unforeseen events with catastrophic consequences. Information and the ability that networks provide to make this information available to those who need it, as well as the ability for individuals and organizations to collaborate, are the lifeblood of military and civil-military operations. The quality, reliability, availability, timeliness, discoverability, relevance, and security of information and interactions among individuals and organizations across the enterprise (warﬁghting, with business and <span style="font-size: 16px;">intelligence support) will have profound consequences for successful mission execution.</span>

Scenario 1 is Net Centric Warfare

**Other countries are pursuing NCW – US needs to secure hegemonic advantage by acting first – key to ground and air power**

He has spoken and written extensively on the topic of warfare in the information age, 20<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">03</span> [“Network-Centric Warfare Offers Warfighting Advantage”, Signal Online, May, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=235&zoneid=62]]</span>, mcG]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Datalinks are the new weapon of the information age</span>. The term network-centric warfare broadly describes the combination of emerging tactics, techniques and procedures that a networked force can employ to create a decisive warfighting advantage. According to John Keegan, author of A History of Warfare, it is similar to the significant warfighting developments of the industrial age and agrarian age in that <span style="font-size: 16px;">network-centric warfare seeks to exploit an order of magnitude change in an underlying source of power to increase warfighting advantage dramatically.</span>Paula Kaufman, in an article she wrote for IEEE Spectrum, agrees with this opinion<span style="font-size: 16px;">. In the industrial age, power was primarily derived from mass and the sources of power for moving mass. In the information age, power is increasingly derived from information sharing, information access and speed,</span> she says. The advantages network-centric warfare brings to the battlespace are particularly relevant to the tactical and operational levels of war, but they impact all levels of military activity from the tactical to the strategic. Although <span style="font-size: 16px;">the construct of an information advantage may seem somewhat intangible, it can be measured, and its impact on military operations can be evaluated in terms of mission effectiveness, survivability and lethality</span>—coins of the realm used by warfighters across the ages. Evidence of the power of network-centric warfare accumulated from a wide range of activities, including combat operations, training events, exercises and demonstrations, continues to strengthen and reinforce its existing tenets. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A U.S. Defense Department 2001 report to Congress about network-centric warfare enumerates several specific points: A robustly networked force improves information sharing; information sharing and collaboration enhances the quality of information and shared situational awareness; shared situational awareness enables collaboration and self-synchronization and enhances sustainability and speed of command; and these in turn dramatically increase mission effectiveness. </span>Although the margin of victory has varied across mission areas, the outcome has consistently been decisive in favor of forces that are robustly networked. In some tactical engagements, <span style="font-size: 16px;">superior platforms were decisively defeated by less capable platforms that leveraged the order of magnitude improvement in information sharing that networking enables.</span> In other engagements, digitized and networked ground forces with a reduced number of platforms were able to substitute information for mass and outperform units that had fought with a larger number of platforms not similarly digitized and networked. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Even more impressive, the combination of networked and digitized ground and air forces was able to defeat an opposition force decisively with unprecedented lethality by creating and leveraging an information advantage</span>. Most recently, military operations in support of operation Enduring Freedom highlighted the emergence of near-real-time information sharing as a source of warfighting advantage. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The source of power was not new platforms, but rather the networking of the legacy platforms with special operations forces</span> (SOF). The extent to which ground-based SOF were able to share precision information with command and control aircraft and fighter, bomber and attack aircraft was unprecedented in military operations. It represented an order of magnitude increase in information sharing over what had been previously demonstrated anywhere in the world in combat operations. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Two of the more noteworthy and documented examples of the power of network-centric warfare are drawn from the air-to-air mission. In this mission area, a major contributor to enhanced survivability and lethality is an increase in shared situational awareness</span> and enhanced situational understanding. With audio-only communications, p<span style="font-size: 16px;">ilots and controllers must share information</span>generated by onboard sensors about opposing forces as well as their own position and status via voice. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Communicating the minimum essential information required to take offensive or defensive actions takes time, and the resulting situational awareness can often differ significantly from reality</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">In contrast, when datalinks are employed on fighter aircraft, digital information on blue and red forces is shared instantaneously, enabling all participants to share a common tactical picture. This improved information position constitutes a significant information advantage vis-à-vis an adversary fighting with voice-only communications. This information advantage in turn enables a cognitive advantage in the form of dramatically increased shared situational awareness and enhanced situational understanding. The result is that pilots flying datalink-equipped aircraft can achieve much higher levels of shared situational awareness and understanding on a timeline previously unachievable with voice-only communications. They can translate these advantages into increased survivability and lethality. One of the best examples of how networking and digitization can be leveraged to create an information advantage took place in a training exercise in the mid-1990s when Royal Air Force (RAF) Tornado aircraft from U.K. 29 Squadron with tactical datalinks defeated U.S. Air Force F-15Cs with voice-only communications in a series of air-to-air engagements that took place during a red flag exercise in the airspace over the Nellis Air Force Base range. Historically, the most favorable outcome that the absolute best RAF pilots could manage when flying against F-15Cs was a draw. However, when the RAF introduced a datalink in the form of Link-16, U.K. 29 Squadron pilots, flying with new innovative tactics, were able to increase their kill ratio over the F-15C equipped with voice-only communications to approximately 4-to-1. The power of information sharing to increase survivability and lethality in the air-to-air mission was substantiated by the Air Force again in the mid-1990s during a joint tactical information distribution system (JTIDS) operational special project. Air Force pilots flying F-15Cs with and without datalinks clearly demonstrated an order of magnitude increase in information sharing enabled by the datalinks. This operational special project consisted of hundreds of tactical engagements, ranging in size from two-versus-two to eight-versus-16 aircraft, which were conducted during day and night conditions. During the more than 12,000 sorties and more than 19,000 flying hours, the average kill ratio for F-15Cs equipped with datalinks increased by more than 150 percent over F-15Cs fighting with voice-only communications, according to a JTIDS operational special project report to Congress. An analysis of the growing body of evidence highlights a very strong relationship between information advantage, cognitive advantage and increased lethality and survivability at the tactical level. It shows that these relationships are not unique to the air-to-air mission but rather that they were demonstrated first in this mission area as a result of the relative maturity of the application of networking technology in this arena. This same story line of increased warfighting effectiveness enabled by networking has been played out in counter special operations forces mission Fleet Battle Experiment Delta; counter anti-access, Fleet Battle Experiment Foxtrot; multinational rapid reaction forces, Allied Command Europe Mobile Force–Land; and combined arms maneuver warfare, Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I (DCX-I). During DCX-I, the blue force was digitized and networked to an unprecedented degree. Equally important, these forces were highly trained on this digital equipment and in many cases had developed new tactics, techniques and procedures to leverage their improved capability to operate in the information domain.</span> <span style="font-size: 16px;">The digitized and networked ground forces demonstrated significantly improved warfighting capabilities and were able to prevail over the opposing forces in a number of engagements</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">For example, during one phase of the exercise, the blue force was in a defensive posture with the opposing force moving to contact under the cover of darkness. A significant column of armor was detected by the joint surveillance target attack radar system and positively identified as hostile by a Hunter unmanned aerial vehicle, Col. Fred Stein, USA (Ret.), explains. An analysis of the real-time blue ground picture indicated that the attacking opposing force column was located approximately 10 miles from the brigade combat team’s defensive positions. The brigade commander, in consultation with the division commander, decided to engage the hostile force, and the fire mission was assigned to close air support. At this point, the engagement departed from the usual script, which had been characterized in the past by some as an exercise in futility, according to an internal correspondence from the Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Test Center. F-16s and A/OA-10s of the Arizona Air National Guard equipped with the situational awareness data link (SADL) performed a close-air-support mission. The networking of these aircraft enabled them to exchange real-time targeting information as well as to receive and display a forward trace of the blue ground picture. The result of this networking was more than an order of magnitude improvement in the ability of ground and air forces to share information. In addition to being equipped with SADL, the F-16s were equipped with Lightening II targeting pods and a mixed weapons load of GBU-12s and AGM-65D Mavericks. The Forward Air Controller–Airborne (FAC-A) determined that employing the F-16s as a coordinated pair would maximize combat power. In engaging the ground targets, the A/OA-10 FAC-A identified targets of interest and distributed sensor points of interest over SADL to facilitate sensor cueing by the F-16’s Lightening II targeting pod. Employing these tactics enabled each wave of two-ship pairs to engage tanks selectively and avoid dropping ordnance on less significant targets. The battle damage assessment of the first wave of F-16s was “two battalions rendered combat ineffective.” Follow-on flights of F-16s were equally lethal, according to the Air National Guard correspondence.</span> <span style="font-size: 16px;">The net result of this engagement was that this phase of the training exercise had to be recocked to enable ground forces to accomplish their training objectives for hasty defense and counterattack successfully, </span>Col. Stein says. This transformation of close air support at night from an exercise in futility to devastatingly effective combat highlights the efficacy of network-centric warfare. The impact of digitization and networking on the combined arms fight, specifically the impact of digital close air support, is described in an Army evaluation of DCX-I. “The National Training Center is a playing field that often humbles the visiting team,” it reports. “However, during the U.S. Army’s Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I, the visiting team, in the form of the U.S. Army’s 4th Infantry Division, supported by elements of the U.S. Air Force, including elements of the Arizona Air National Guard, were able to leverage the power of an order of magnitude increase in information sharing to turn the tables on the opposing forces on at least two occasions. Of particular significance was a devastating defeat of opposing forces at night by F-16 and A/OA-10 aircraft performing the close-air-support mission.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Worldwide, militaries are crafting their individual responses to the challenges and opportunities of the information age. They are taking actions that demonstrate an increased understanding of the sources of information age warfighting advantage</span>. A new vocabulary has developed that reflects the subtle variations in underlying strategies and core missions of militaries worldwide. To varying degrees, these actions also are reflected in emerging concepts and doctrine, focused investments in key enablers and well-crafted programs of experimentation. Besides network-centric warfare, currently used by the armed forces of the United States, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, other coined terms include Australia’s network-enabled warfare, the United Kingdom’s network-enabled capability, the Swedish armed forces’ network-based defense and the armed forces of the Republic of Singapore’s knowledge-based command and control. Each of these terms reflects its respective military’s ongoing response to the information age. Clearly, militaries worldwide are continuing to take a close look at network-centric warfare and related concepts for information age warfare. Evidently they like what they see.
Net-Centric Warfare is essential to prevent nuclear war, deter aggression, make heg sustainable and prevents nuclear terrorism – low cost, quicker fighting force will be necessary in dominating the military sphere
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Arquilla 10</span> (John Arquilla, professor of defense analysis at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, MARCH/APRIL 2010, “The New Rules of War”, [[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/22/the_new_rules_of_war]])

In another sign of the gathering swarm, the August 2008 Russian incursion into Georgia, rather than being a blast from the Cold War past, heralded the possibility that more traditional armies can master the art of omnidirectional attack. In this instance, Russian regular forces were augmented by ethnic militias fighting all over the area of operations — <span style="font-size: 16px;">and there was swarming in cyberspace at the same time. Indeed, the distributed denial of service attack, long a staple of cyberwarriors, is a model form of swarming</span>. And in this instance, <span style="font-size: 16px;">Georgian command and control was seriously disrupted by the hackers</span>. Simultaneous attack from several directions might be at the very cutting edge in conflict, but its lineage is quite old. Traditional tribal warfare, whether by nomadic horse archers or bush fighters, always featured some elements of swarms. The zenith of this kind of fighting probably came with the 13th-century Mongols, who had a name for this doctrine: “Crow Swarm.” When the attack was not carried out at close quarters by charging horsemen, but was instead conducted via arrows raining down on massed targets, the khans called it “Falling Stars.” With such tactics, the Mongols carved out the largest empire the world has ever seen, and kept it for a few centuries. But swarming was eclipsed by the rise of guns in the 15th century, which strongly favored massed volley fire. Industrial processes encouraged even more massing, and mechanization favored large flank maneuvers more than small swarms. Now again, in an age of global interdependence replete with advanced information technologies, even quite small teams of fighters can cause huge amounts of disruption. There is an old Mongol proverb: “With 40 men you can shake the world.” Look at what al Qaeda did with less than half that number on Sept. 11, 2001. This point was made by the great British strategist B.H. Liddell Hart in his biography of T.E. Lawrence, a master of the swarm in his own right. Liddell Hart, writing in 1935, predicted that at some point “the old concentration of force is likely to be replaced by an intangibly ubiquitous distribution of force — pressing everywhere, yet assailable nowhere.” Now, <span style="font-size: 16px;">swarming is making a comeback, but at a time when few organized militaries are willing or able to recognize its return. </span>For the implications of this development — most notably, that fighting units in very small numbers can do amazing things if used to swarm — are profoundly destabilizing. The most radical change is this: Standing armies can be sharply reduced in size, if properly reconfigured and trained to fight in this manner. Instead of continually “surging” large numbers of troops to trouble spots, the basic response of a swarm force would be to go swiftly, in small numbers, and strike the attackers at many points. In the future, it will take a swarm to defeat a swarm. Almost 20 years ago, I began a debate about networks that blossomed into an unlikely friendship with Vice Adm. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Art Cebrowski, the modern strategic thinker most likely to be as well remembered as Alfred Thayer Mahan, the great American apostle of sea power. He was the first in the Pentagon power structure to warm to my notions of developing fighting networks, embracing the idea of opening lots of lateral communications links between “sensors and shooters</span>.” We disagreed, however, about the potential of networks. Cebrowski thought that “<span style="font-size: 16px;">network-centric warfare” could be used to improve the performance of existing tools</span>— including aircraft carriers — for some time to come. I thought that networking implied a wholly new kind of navy, one made up of small, swift vessels, many of them remotely operated. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Cebrowski</span>, who passed away in late 2005, <span style="font-size: 16px;">clearly won this debate</span>, as <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. Navy remains heavily invested in being a “few-large” force — if one that is increasingly networked</span>. In an implicit nod to David Ronfeldt’s and my ideas, the Navy even has a Netwar Command now. Swarming has also gained some adherents. The most notable has been Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, who famously used swarm tactics in the last great Pentagon war game, “Millennium Challenge 2002,” to sink several aircraft carriers at the outset of the imagined conflict. But rather than accept that something quite radical was going on, the referees were instructed to “refloat” the carriers, and the costly game — its price tag ran in the few hundred millions — continued. Van Riper walked out. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Today, some in the U.S. military still pursue the idea of swarming, mostly in hopes of employing large numbers of small unmanned aerial vehicles in combat</span>. But military habits of mind and institutional interests continue to reflect a greater audience for surges than swarms. What //<span style="font-size: 16px;">if senior military leaders wake up and decide to take networks and swarming absolutely seriously</span>//? If they ever do, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">it is likely that the scourges of terrorism and aggression will become less a part of the world system</span>//. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Such a military would be smaller but quicker to respond, less costly but more lethal. The world system would become far less prone to many of the kinds of violence that have plagued it</span>. Networking and swarming are the organizational and doctrinal keys, respectively, to the strategic puzzle that has been waiting to be solved in our time. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A networked U.S. military that knows how to swarm would have much smaller active manpower</span> — easily two-thirds less than the more than 2 million serving today — but would be organized in hundreds more little units of mixed forces. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The model for military intervention would be the 200 Special Forces “horse soldiers</span>” who beat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan late in 2001. Such teams would deploy quickly and lethally, with ample reserves for relieving “first waves” and dealing with other crises. <span style="font-size: 16px;">At sea, instead of concentrating firepower in a handful of large, increasingly vulnerable supercarriers, the U.S. Navy would distribute its capabilities across many hundreds of small craft armed with very smart weapons.</span> Given their stealth and multiple uses, submarines would stay while carriers would go. And in the air, the “wings” would reduce in size but increase in overall number, with mere handfuls of aircraft in each. Needless to say, networking means that these small pieces would still be able to join together to swarm enemies, large or small. Is such a shift feasible? Absolutely. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Big reductions in the U.S. military are nothing new. The massive demobilization after World War II aside, active forces were reduced 40 percent in the few years after the Vietnam War and by another third right after the end of the Cold War</span>. But the key is not so much in cutting as it is in redesigning and rethinking. But what happens if the status quo prevails and the potential of this new round of changes in strategic affairs is ignored or misinterpreted? Failure awaits, at ruinous cost. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">The most likely form catastrophe </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">could take is that terrorist networks would stay on their feet long enough to acquire nuclear weapons</span>//. Even a handful of warheads in Osama bin Laden’s hands would give him great coercive power, as a network cannot be targeted for retaliation the same way a country can. Deterrence will lie in tatters. If there is ever to be a nuclear Napoleon, he will come from a terrorist network. Within the U.S. military, the danger is that senior commanders will fall back on a fatalism driven by their belief that both congressional and industrial leaders will thwart any effort at radical change. I have heard this objection countless times since the early 1990s, repeated mantra-like, all the way up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thus the mighty U.S. war machine is like a Gulliver trussed up by Lilliputian politicians and businessmen. The irony, however, is that <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. military has never been in a better position to gain acceptance for truly transformational change. Neither party in Congress can afford to be portrayed as standing in the way of strategic progress, and so, whatever the Pentagon asks for, it gets.</span> As for <span style="font-size: 16px;">defense contractors</span>, far from driving the agenda, they <span style="font-size: 16px;">are much too willing to give their military customers exactly what they demand</span> (rather than, perhaps, something better). <span style="font-size: 16px;">If the U.S. armed forces call for smaller, smarter weapons and systems to support swarming, they will get them. </span>Beyond the United States, <span style="font-size: 16px;">other countries' security forces are beginning to think along the lines of "many and small," are crafting better ways to "find," and are learning to swarm. Chinese naval thought today is clearly moving in this direction. Russian ground forces are, too</span>. Needless to say, <span style="font-size: 16px;">terrorist networks are still in the lead,</span> and not just al Qaeda. Hezbollah gave quite a demonstration of all three of the new rules of war in its summer 2006 conflict with Israel, a virtual laboratory test of nation versus network -- in which the network more than held its own. For the U.S. military, <span style="font-size: 16px;">failing a great leap forward in self-awareness of the need for radical change, a downward budgetary nudge is probably the best approach</span> -- despite President Barack Obama's unwillingness to extend his fiscal austerity program to security-related expenditures. This could take the form of a freeze on defense spending levels, to be followed by several years of, say, 10 percent annual reductions. To focus the redesign effort, a moratorium would be declared on all legacy-like systems (think aircraft carriers, other big ships, advanced fighters, tanks, etc.) while they are subjected to searching review. It should not be assumed that the huge sums invested in national defense have been wisely spent. <span style="font-size: 16px;">To most Americans who think that being strong on defense means devoting more resources and building bigger systems, this suggestion to cut spending will sound outrageous</span>. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">being smarter about defense might lower costs even as effectiveness improves. This pattern has held throughout the transformations of the last few decades, whether in farming or in industry. Why should the military be exempt? </span>There's real urgency to this debate. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Not only has history not ended with the Cold War and the advent of commerce-driven globalization, but conflict and violence have persisted -- even grown -- into a new postmodern scourge. </span>Indeed, it is ironic that, in an era in which the attraction to persuasive "soft power" has grown dramatically, <span style="font-size: 16px;">coercive "hard power" continues to dominate in world affairs. This is no surprise in the case of rogue nations hellbent on developing nuclear arsenals to ensure their security, nor when it comes to terrorist networks that think their essential nature is revealed in and sustained by violent acts.</span> But <span style="font-size: 16px;">this primary reliance on coercive capabilities is also on display across a range of countries great and small, most notably the United States, whose defense policy has over the past decade largely become its foreign policy. From the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to simmering crises with North Korea and Iran, and on to longer-range strategic concerns about East Asian and Central European security, the United States today is heavily invested in hard-power solutions. And it will continue to be. But if the radical adjustments in strategy, organization, and doctrine implied by the new rules of war are ignored, Americans will go on spending more and getting less when it comes to national defense</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">.</span>**</span>**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Networks will persist until they have the capability to land nuclear blows</span>**<span style="font-size: 16px;">.Other countries will leapfrog ahead of the United States militarily, and concepts like "deterrence" and "containment" of aggression will blow away like leaves in the wind. </span>So it has always been. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Every era of technological change has resulted in profound shifts in military and strategic affairs</span>. History tells us that <span style="font-size: 16px;">these developments were inevitable, but soldiers and statesmen were almost always too late in embracing them -- and tragedies upon tragedies ensued. There is still time to be counted among the exceptions</span>, like the Byzantines who, after the fall of Rome, radically redesigned their military and preserved their empire for another thousand years. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The U.S. goal should be to join the ranks of those who, in their eras, caught glimpses of the future and acted in time to shape it, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">saving the world from darkness</span>**</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">. </span>

Airpower credibility prevents nuclear war

<span style="font-family: Times;">Courtney Purrington, and Michael D. Swaine</span>“<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 16px;">SOURCES OF CONFLICT IN ASIA”, </span>[[http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR897/MR897.chap3.pdf]]]
This subsection attempts to synthesize some of the key operational implications distilled from the analyses relating to the rise of Asia and <span style="font-size: 16px;">the potential for conflict in each of its constituent regions</span>. The first key implication derived from the analysis of trends in Asia suggests that <span style="font-size: 16px;">American air</span> and space <span style="font-size: 16px;">power will continue to remain critical for conventional and unconventional deterrence</span>in Asia. This argument is justified by the fact that <span style="font-size: 16px;">several subregions of the conti- nent still harbor the potential for full-scale conventional war</span>. This potential is most conspicuous on the Korean peninsula and, to a lesser degree, in South Asia, the Persian Gulf, and the South China Sea. In some of these areas, such as Korea and the Persian Gulf, the United States has clear treaty obligations and, therefore, has pre- planned the use of air power should contingencies arise. <span style="font-size: 16px;">U.S. Air Force assets could also be called upon for operations in some of these other areas. In almost all these cases, U.S. air power would be at the forefront of an American politico-military response because</span> (a) <span style="font-size: 16px;">of the vast dis- tances on the Asian continent</span>; (b) <span style="font-size: 16px;">the diverse range of operational platforms available to the U.S. Air Force, a capability unmatched by any other country or service;</span> (c) <span style="font-size: 16px;">the possible unavailability of naval assets in close proximity, particularly in the context of surprise con- tingencies</span>; and (d) the heavy payload that can be carried by U.S. Air Force platforms. <span style="font-size: 16px;">These platforms can exploit speed, reach, and high operating tempos to sustain continual operations until the political objectives</span> are secured. The entire range of warfighting capability—fighters, bombers, elec- tronic warfare (EW), suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD), com- bat support platforms such as AWACS and J-STARS, and tankers—are relevant in the Asia-Pacific region, because <span style="font-size: 16px;">many of the regional contingencies will involve armed operations against large, fairly modern, conventional forces, most of which are built around large</span>Sources of Conflict in Asia 165 <span style="font-size: 16px;">land armies</span>, as is the case in Korea, China-Taiwan, India-Pakistan, and the Persian Gulf. In addition to conventional combat, the demands of unconventional deterrence will increasingly confront the U.S. Air Force in Asia. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The Korean peninsula, China, and the Indian subcontinent are already arenas of WMD proliferation</span>. While emergent nuclear capabilities continue to receive the most public attention, <span style="font-size: 16px;">chemical and biologi- cal warfare threats will progressively become future problems.</span> The delivery systems in the region are increasing in range and diversity. China already targets the continental United States with ballistic missiles. North Korea can threaten northeast Asia with existing Scud-class theater ballistic missiles. India will acquire the capability to produce ICBM-class delivery vehicles, and both China and India will acquire long-range cruise missiles during the time frames exam- ined in this report.

Second, these regimes have ambitions in their regions and around the world.[37] <span style="font-size: 16px;">Some of their leaders are </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">fanatical enough to actually consider a first strike using nuclear weapons</span>//; for example, <span style="font-size: 16px;">high-ranking officials of</span> the <span style="font-size: 16px;">Iran</span>ian government <span style="font-size: 16px;">have openly discussed using a nuclear weapon against Israel</span>.[38] Whether a first strike occurs or not, the possession of nuclear capability frees aggressive regimes to pursue their other goals violently with less fear of retaliation. For example, <span style="font-size: 16px;">North Korea’s nuclear capability means that it could </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">attack South</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">Korea</span>// conventionally with a measure of impunity; even if the attack failed, the United States and its allies would be less likely to remove the North Korean regime in retaliation. In other words, <span style="font-size: 16px;">nuclear capability lessens the penalties</span> which could be exacted on North Korea if it engages in aggression, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">which makes the aggression more likely</span>//. The same logic applies to Iran, which is why the other nations in the Middle East are so concerned about Iran’s nuclear program. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A nuclear attack by Iran is possible</span>, but the real danger of <span style="font-size: 16px;">Iranian nuclear capability</span> is that it <span style="font-size: 16px;">would make </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">conventional aggression in the region more likely</span>//.[39] Finally, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the more nations that get nuclear weapons, </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">the</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">greater the pressure on other nations to acquire them</span>// as a deterrent, <span style="font-size: 16px;">and this is particularly true when a government</span> acquiring the capability <span style="font-size: 16px;">is seen as </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">unstable </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">oraggressive</span>//. North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons has tended, for obvious reasons, to make the South Koreans and Japanese uncomfortable about having no deterrent themselves. The possibility of uncontrolled proliferation—what experts call <span style="font-size: 16px;">a “nuclear cascade</span>”[40]—<span style="font-size: 16px;">is </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">tremendously dangerous</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">; it increases the possibility that terrorists can get nuclear material</span> from a national program, <span style="font-size: 16px;">and it raises the prospect of a </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">multilateral nuclear confrontation</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;"> between nations</span>.[41] Many of <span style="font-size: 16px;">the smaller nuclear nations do not have</span> well-established <span style="font-size: 16px;">first strike doctrine</span> or launch protocols; <span style="font-size: 16px;">the chance of a nuclear exchange, accidental or intentional, increases </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">geometrically</span>// //<span style="font-size: 16px;">when a confrontation is multilateral. The antidote to proliferation is American leadership and power. The reality and perception of American strength not only deters aggressive regimes from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; it reassures other countries that they can exist safely under the umbrella of American power without having to develop their own deterrent capability</span>//.[42]



Terrorism risks Extinction

In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question “Is Nuclear War Inevitable??” In Section , Moore points out what most <span style="font-size: 16px;">terrorists</span>obviously already <span style="font-size: 16px;">know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange</span>. As Moore points out, <span style="font-size: 16px;">all</span> that militant <span style="font-size: 16px;">terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb</span> and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Because of the Russian “dead hand” system, “where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,” it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States</span>” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Israeli leaders</span> and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it <span style="font-size: 16px;">would retaliate with the suicidal “Samson option</span>” against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even “anti-Semitic” European cities In that case, of course, <span style="font-size: 16px;">Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of </span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">nuclear warheads</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">,</span> many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">would rain </span>upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radi<span style="font-size: 16px;">oactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations </span>in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And <span style="font-size: 16px;">what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Any accident, mistaken communication, false signal or “lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason could, in a matter of a few minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons</span>, and once a weapon is used, then the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is actually less probable since <span style="font-size: 16px;">each country would act under the “use them or lose them” strategy and psychology</span>; restraint by one power would be interpreted as a weakness by the other, which could be exploited as a window of opportunity to “win” the war. In other words, <span style="font-size: 16px;">once Pandora's Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them</span>. Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, “everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self-determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors” In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and once even just one is used, it is very likely that many, if not all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of much of human civilization while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter. In “Scenarios,” Moore summarizes the various ways a nuclear war could begin: <span style="font-size: 16px;">Such a war could start through a reaction to terrorist attacks, or through the need to protect against overwhelming military opposition</span>, or through the use of small battle field tactical nuclear weapons meant to destroy hardened targets. It might quickly move on to the use of strategic nuclear weapons delivered by short-range or inter-continental missiles or long-range bombers. These could deliver high altitude bursts whose electromagnetic pulse knocks out electrical circuits for hundreds of square miles. Or they could deliver nuclear bombs to destroy nuclear and/or non-nuclear military facilities, nuclear power plants, important industrial sites and cities. Or it could skip all those steps and start through the accidental or reckless use of strategic weapons



Leadership prevents nuclear war
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Khalilzad 95</span> – Zalmay Khalilzad, RAND, Washington Quarterly, Spring, 1995
Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because <span style="font-size: 16px;">a world in which the U</span>nited <span style="font-size: 16px;">S</span>tates <span style="font-size: 16px;">exercises leadership would</span>have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would <span style="font-size: 16px;">have a better chance of dealing</span>cooperatively <span style="font-size: 16px;">with</span> the world's <span style="font-size: 16px;">major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts</span>. Finally, U.S.<span style="font-size: 16px;">leadership would</span>help <span style="font-size: 16px;">preclude the rise of another hostile</span> global <span style="font-size: 16px;">rival, enabling</span> the United States and <span style="font-size: 16px;">the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange</span>. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.
Intervention is inevitable – hegemony is necessary to prevent war
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Kagan, 2k</span> (Robert, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment, Burden of Power is Having to Wield It, Carnegie, Washington Post, March 19, 2000, [[http://www.carnegieendowment.org]])

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The question, then, is not whether the United States should intervene everywhere or nowhere. The decision Americans need to make is whether the United States should generally lean forward, or whether it should adopt a posture of relative passivity. A strong America capable of projecting force quickly and with devastating effect to important regions of the world would make it less likely that challengers to regional stability will attempt to alter the status quo in their favor. It might even deter them from undertaking expensive efforts to arm themselves for such a challenge. An America whose willingness to project force is in doubt, on the other hand, can only encourage such challenges. In Europe, in Asia and in the Middle East, the message we should be sending to potential foes is: "Don't even think about it." That kind of deterrence offers the best recipe for lasting peace, and it is much cheaper than fighting the wars that would follow should we fail to create such a deterrent</span>.

We do know that Russian Prime Minister <span style="font-size: 16px;">Vladimir Putin has promised a nearly 30 percent increase in the Russian defense budget for 2009</span> for reasons that can only be associated <span style="font-size: 16px;">with a desire</span> by Moscow <span style="font-size: 16px;">to exert increasing leverage in its tradition­al sphere of influence--and perhaps beyond</span>. We also <span style="font-size: 16px;">know Russia has conducted more ballistic mis­sile tests this year than any year since the end of the Cold War</span>. We further know that the Kremlin has planted a flag on the seabed at the North Pole, asserting claims to an area the size of France, Germany, and Italy combined--an area which may hold one-third of the world's total undiscovered energy reserves. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Russian action in Georgia and threats against Ukraine aren't comforting</span>, either. Considering the weak defense spending in Europe, who will be able to stand up to this new Russia if necessary? I would suggest that, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">absent American military might</span>//, NATO--or any future<span style="font-size: 16px;">European defense force--might be little more than a paper tiger in the shadow of the Russian bear.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR.

Unfortunately, we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century.

Loss of US hegemony cause German nuclearization causing preemptive strikes and a Russo-German power war – and larger European wars – all go nuclear
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Mearsheimer 01</span>, Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago (John, “The Future of the American Pacifier”, Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct, p 46)
<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">FIVE EUROPEAN STATES now have sufficient wealth and population to qualify as potential great powers: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia. Of these, however</span>, <span style="font-size: 16px;">only Germany has the earmarks of a potential hegemon. It is the wealthiest European state, has the second-largest population (</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">after Russia), </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">and has the most powerful army in the region</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">Nevertheless</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">, Germany is not a great power today, much less a potential hegemon, because it has no nuclear weapons of its own and because it is heavily dependent on the United States for its security. If American troops were pulled out of Europe, however, and Germany became responsible for its own defense, it would probably acquire its own nuclear arsenal and increase the size of its army, transforming itself into something much more formidable</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. To illustrate Germany's potential military might, consider the population and wealth differentials between Germany and Russia during the twentieth century. Although Russia has always enjoyed a significant population advantage over Germany, its present edge is smaller than at any other time in the past hundred years. For example, Russia had approximately 2.6 times as many people as Germany in 1913 (175 million vs. 67 million), and twice as many in 1940 (170 million vs. 85 million). Despite this population disadvantage, Germany was a potential hegemon in both those years because of its marked advantage in wealth. It had a roughly 3.6-to-1 advantage in industrial might over Russia in 1913, and a 1.3-to-1 advantage in 1940. Over the last 15 years, the balance has shifted quite rapidly in Germany's favor, bringing it back to a very powerful position. In 1987, a representative year of the Cold War, the Soviet Union had roughly 4.7 times as many people as did West Germany (285 million vs. 61 million). Russia today, however, has only about 1.8 times as many people as Germany (147 million vs. 82 million), and Germany has a startling 6.6-to-1 advantage in wealth. Thus Germany now has a significant advantage in latent power over Russia, much like it had in the early twentieth century, when it was the dominant power in Europe. Germany also has an advantage in conventional military power. The size of Germany's standing army is 221,000 soldiers, and it can be quickly augmented by 295,400 reserves, thus creating a highly effective fighting force of more than half a million soldiers. Russia has about 348,000 soldiers in its standing army, and although it has a large pool of reserves, they are poorly trained and hard to mobilize quickly and efficiently in a crisis. In terms of quality, the German army is well trained and well led, whereas the Russian army is neither. Only on the nuclear front does Russia dominate, but Germany has the wherewithal to rectify this asymmetry if it chooses to. Yet even though Germany is likely to become a potential hegemon if it has to provide for its own security, the United States is still likely to pull its forces out of Europe. Why? Because despite Germany's significant military potential, other European powers should be able to keep it from dominating Europe without help from the United States. The United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Russia together have about three times as many people as Germany does, and their combined wealth is roughly three times greater than Germany's. The United Kingdom, France, and Russia all have nuclear weapons, moreover, providing a strong deterrent against an expansionist Germany even if it does develop its own nuclear option.</span> <span style="font-size: 16px;">Without the American pacifier, Europe is not guaranteed to remain peaceful. Indeed, intense security competition among the great powers would likely ensue </span>because, upon American withdrawal, Europe would go from benign bipolarity to unbalanced multipolarity, the most dangerous kind of power structure. The United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany would have to build up their own military forces and provide for their own security<span style="font-size: 16px;">.</span> In effect<span style="font-size: 16px;">, they would all become great powers, making Europe multipolar and raising the ever-present possibility that they might fight among themselves. And Germany would probably become a potential hegemon </span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">and thus the main source of worry</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">Looking at Europe today, such a forecast might appear far-fetched, but that is because </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">few are prepared to consider how radically the European security environment will be transformed by the withdrawal of U.S. troops. Once the major European powers are forced to provide for their own defense, suspicions among them are certain to grow, thereby triggering the familiar dynamics of great-power competition</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">The kind of trouble that might lie ahead for Europe can be illustrated by considering how particular German measures aimed at enhancing its security might nevertheless lead to instability</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">. </span>If the United States removed its security umbrella from over western Europe, Germany would likely move to acquire its own nuclear arsenal. This would be the case both because nuclear weapons are an excellent deterrent, as Germany's governing elites recognized during the Cold War, but also because it would be the best way to escape potential coercion by its three nuclear-armed neighbors. <span style="font-size: 16px;">During the proliferation process, however, these neighbors would probably contemplate using force to prevent Germany from going nuclear, and the result could be a major crisis. Without the American military on its territory, furthermore, Germany would probably increase the size of its army and certainly would be more inclined to try to dominate central Europe</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">Why?</span> <span style="font-size: 16px;">Because Germany would fear Russian control of that critically important buffer zone between them. Of course, Russia would have the same fear in reverse, </span>which would likely lead to a serious security competition between them for control of central Europe. France, meanwhile, would undoubtedly view such behavior by Germany with alarm and take measures to protect itself--for example, by increasing its defense spending and establishing closer relations with Russia. Germany, of course, would perceive these actions as hostile and respond with measures of its own.

Scenario 2 is Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance

Information backlogs in the status quo makes drone strikes ineffective – result in civilian casualties
Thom <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Shanker</span> is Pentagon correspondent for The New York Times <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Matt <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Richtel</span> is a technology correspondent in the San Francisco bureau of The New York Times, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">11</span> [“In New Military, Data Overload Can Be Deadly”, New York Times, Jan 16, [[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/technology/17brain.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all]]]
When <span style="font-size: 16px;">military investigators</span> looked into an attack by American helicopters last February that left 23 Afghan civilians dead, they <span style="font-size: 16px;">found that the operator of a Predator drone had failed to pass along crucial information about the makeup of a gathering crowd of villagers</span>. But Air Force and Army officials now say there was also an //<span style="font-size: 16px;">underlying cause for that </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">mistake: information overload</span>//. At an Air Force base in Nevada, the drone operator and his team struggled to work out what was happening in the village, where a convoy was forming. <span style="font-size: 16px;">They had to monitor the drone’s video feeds while participating in dozens of instant-message and radio exchanges with intelligence analysts and troops on the ground</span>. There were solid reports that the group included children, but the team did not adequately focus on them amid the swirl of data — much like a cubicle worker who loses track of an important e-mail under the mounting pile. The team was under intense pressure to protect American forces nearby, and in the end it determined, incorrectly, that the villagers’ convoy posed an imminent threat, resulting in one of the worst losses of civilian lives in the war in Afghanistan. “<span style="font-size: 16px;">Information overload — an accurate description,” said one senior military officer, who was briefed on the inquiry and spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case might yet result in a court martial</span>. The deaths would have been prevented, he said, “if we had just slowed things down and thought deliberately.” //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Data is </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">among the most potent weapons of the 21st century</span>//. Unprecedented amounts of raw information help the military determine what targets to hit and what to avoid. And <span style="font-size: 16px;">drone-based sensors have given rise to a new class of wired warriors who must filter the information sea</span>. But sometimes they are drowning. Research shows that the kind of intense multitasking required in such situations can make it hard to tell good information from bad. The military faces a balancing act: how to help soldiers exploit masses of data without succumbing to overload. Across the military, the data flow has surged; since the attacks of 9/11, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the amount of intelligence gathered by remotely piloted drones and other surveillance technologies has risen 1,600 percent</span>. On the ground, <span style="font-size: 16px;">troops increasingly use hand-held devices to communicate, get directions and set bombing coordinates. And the screens in jets can be so packed with data that some pilots call them “drool buckets” because, they say, they can get lost staring into them. “There is information overload at every level of the military</span> — from the general to the soldier on the ground,” said Art Kramer, a neuroscientist and director of the Beckman Institute, a research lab at the University of Illinois.

That's why the efficacy of missile strikes must be reassessed</span><span style="font-family: Times;">.The targeting of tribal safe havens by </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">CIA-operated drone strikes strengthens the very jihadist forces that America seeks to defeat, by alienating hearts and minds in a fragile, nuclear-armed, Muslim-majority Pakistani state</span><span style="font-family: Times;">.During a recent visit to the frontier region, I spoke with several South Waziri tribesmen about the impact of US missile strikes. They recounted how </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">militants exploit the popular resentment felt from the accidental killing of innocents from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and defined themselves as a force against the injustice of a hostile foreign occupation.The ability to keep militant groups off balance must be weighed against the cost of facilitating the rise of more insurgents</span><span style="font-family: Times;">.</span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 9.33333px;">Missile strikes alienate thousands of clans, sub-clans and extended families within a tribal society that places high social value on honor and </span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">revenge. To the Pashtun tribes straddling the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, personal and collective vendettas have been known to last for generations, and are invoked irrespective of time and cost involved. Successive waves of Persian, Greek, Arab, Turk, Mughal, British and Soviet invaders have never successfully subdued this thin slice of rugged terrain. On August 12, the US special envoy for the region, Richard Holbrooke, told an audience at the Center for American Progress that the porous border and its surrounding areas served as a fertile recruiting ground for Al-Qaeda. One US military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, called drone operations "a recruiting windfall for the Pakistani Taliban."</span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 9.33333px;">Military strikes appear to be the only viable recourse against the tribal region's shadowy insurgents, with US officials pointing to the successful killing of high-value Al-Qaeda militants like Abu Laith al-Libi in January 2008 and chemical weapons expert Abu Khabab al-Masri in July 2008</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">. However, even if tomorrow Osama bin Laden were killed by a UAV, the jihadist insurgency would not melt away. The ability to keep militant groups off balance must be weighed against the cost of facilitating the rise of more insurgents</span><span style="font-family: Times;">.Citizens living outside the ungoverned tribal areas also detest drones. "</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Anti-US sentiment has already been increasing in Pakistan … especially in regard to cross-border and reported drone strikes, which Pakistanis perceive to cause unacceptable civilian casualties," conceded US Central Command chief General David Petraeus in a declassified statement written on May 27, 2009</span><span style="font-family: Times;">.</span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 9.33333px;">Drone strikes also contribute to the widening trust deficit between Pakistanis and the US. A recent poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan for Al-Jazeera found that 59 percent believed the US was the greatest threat to Pakistan. Most Pakistanis oppose extremism; they simply disagree with American tactics.America's interests lie in ensuring the virus of anti-American radicalism does not infect the rest of the region. Yet</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Washington's attempts to stabilize Afghanistan help destabilize Pakistan, because its actions serve as a recruiting tool for Pakistani Taliban militants</span><span style="font-family: Times;">. </span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 9.33333px;">Just as one would not kill a fly with a sledgehammer, using overwhelming firepower to kill a single insurgent creates collateral damage that can recruit 50 more</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. Military force against insurgents must be applied precisely and discriminately. On the ground, Pakistani security forces lack training, equipment, and communication gear to carry out a low-intensity counterinsurgency. But drones provide a poor substitute if the goal is to engage rather than alienate the other side.A better strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan is for the United States to focus on limiting cross-border movement by supporting local Pakistani security forces with a small number of US Special Forces personnel. To improve fighting capabilities and enhance cooperation, Washington and Islamabad must increase the number of military-to-military training programs to help hone Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities and serve as a confidence-building measure to lessen the Pakistan Army's tilt toward radicalism.Ending drone</span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 9.33333px;"> strikes is no panacea for Pakistan's array of problems. But continuing those strikes will certainly deepen the multiple challenges the country faces. Most Pakistanis do not passively accept American actions, and officials in Islamabad cannot afford to be perceived as putting Washington's interests above those of their own people</span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">.</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> Long-term success in both Afghanistan and Pakistan depends on the people's repudiation of extremism. Continued US actions add more fuel to violent religious radicalism; it is time to reassess both US tactics and objectives in the region.</span>

George Perkovich, director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, confessed to his audience, "Those who really know what's going on in Pakistan's nuclear complex aren't talking about it, and those who are talking, including myself, don't really know what's going on in Pakistan's nuclear complex." He also said that when he was contacted for the event, he told Richard Weitz (full disclosure: Richard Weitz is a non-resident senior fellow at Center for a New American Security, where Tom is a senior fellow and I intern) he didn't think it should happen at all, saying "<span style="font-size: 16px;">When Americans, especially, talk about nuclear issues and concerns, in particular about the security of nuclear weapons and fissile materials in Pakistan, that gets heard in many ways in Pakistan and almost all of them are not helpful</span>." The discussion, he said, feeds a narrative in Pakistan, veracity aside, that the United States is only interested in self-preservation, its efforts are far from philanthropic, that it is anti-Muslim, playing favorites with India, and leading a concerted effort to denuclearize Pakistan, possibly with Israeli or Indian aid. The discussion continued, despite the caveats. The point that all three panelists expressed was simple but important: //<span style="font-size: 16px;">U.S. fears of terrorists acquiring a nuclear weapon from Pakistan, while valid, overlook the greater threat of a nuclear conflict with India. The fuse to ignite a war has been lit before -- at Kargil in 1999, after the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001, and most recently, after the Mumbai attacks in 2008 -- but a nuclear exchange has been prevented each time. With each of these incidents, though, the fuse has been cut shorter. The greatest risk for nuclear war in our time is the scenario in which a Pakistan-based terror group with ties to Inter-Services Intelligence launches another attack on India</span>// ("another Mumbai" is t//<span style="font-size: 16px;">he catchphrase</span>//, but it //<span style="font-size: 16px;">won't</span>// necessarily //<span style="font-size: 16px;">have to be of that scale or spectacle and is widely considered a matter of when, not if</span>//) and //<span style="font-size: 16px;">this touches off a sequence of escalation that results in a nuclear strike </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">and response. It's nearly happened before.</span>// Aparna Pande, a fellow at the Hudson Institute, described //<span style="font-size: 16px;">the strong pro-nuclear strike faction in Indian politics after the Mumbai attacks in 2008 and the common sentiment of, "if Pakistan can cross the border and hit us, why can't we hit back?" The answer is: because it's a short fuse</span>//. That simple fact, and the peril it implies, has been enough in the past, but it might not be good enough next time. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">This is a global problem</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">.</span>// "The impact on the United States is potentially larger than people realize," said Matthew Bunn, co-principal investigator for the Project on Managing the Atom at //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Harvard University</span>//. He described //<span style="font-size: 16px;">studies</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">in which nuclear war was simulated using atmospheric models developed for climate change research, "and if cities are actually burned it can cause enough soot to go up into the upper atmosphere that will stay for a long time, to seriously interfere with global agriculture." The resultant nuclear autumn could cause famine, and not just in South Asia. The bad news is that Pakistan's nuclear program is expanding -- it's set to become the fourth largest nuclear power, it is developing smaller, more mobile bombs, and it is building more nuclear reactors to churn out bulk supplies of weapons-grade uranium</span>//. The good news, though, is that (as far as we can tell) Pakistan has an effective security program in place. The bombs are under the purview of the military, the most stable and competent institution in the country. They are kept disassembled with the components kept in separate buildings, at secret facilities that both India and the United States would be hard-pressed to find. The sites are guarded by thousands of troops being watched by a meticulous internal affairs bureau to screen out extremists. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">It might be sufficient if Pakistan were not one of the most threatening and most threatened countries in the world. Infiltration remains the greatest tactical threat to Pakistan's nuclear security. There will always be a way to slip through a screening process -- in 2009, members of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan attacked the Pakistani Army headquarters in military uniforms carrying forged IDs</span>//, and previously at least two men affiliated with al Qaeda infiltrated then-President Pervez Musharraf's security detail and attempted to assassinate him. The insider threat remains, but as Bunn pointed out, there are only so many security measures that can be put in place that will actually improve Pakistan's already thorough security.
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">World War 3</span>
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Calvin ’98</span> (William, Theoretical Neurophysiologist – U Washington, Atlantic Monthly, January, Vol 281, No. 1, p. 47-64)

The population-crash scenario is surely the most appalling<span style="font-size: 16px;">. Plummeting crop yields would cause some powerful countries to try to take over their neighbors or distant lands -- if only because their armies, unpaid and lacking food, would go marauding, both at home and across the borders. The better-organized countries would attempt to use their armies, before they fell apart entirely, to take over countries with significant remaining resources, </span>driving out or starving their inhabitants if not using modern weapons to accomplish the same end: eliminating competitors for the remaining food.<span style="font-size: 16px;"> This would be a worldwide problem -- and could lead to a Third World War </span>--but Europe's vulnerability is particularly easy to analyze. The last abrupt cooling, the Younger Dryas, drastically altered Europe's climate as far east as Ukraine. Present-day Europe has more than 650 million people. It has excellent soils, and largely grows its own food. It could no longer do so if it lost the extra warming from the North Atlantic.
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Goes nuclear </span>
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Takacs ‘96</span>(David, The Idea Of Diversity: Philosophies Of Paradise, 1996, p. 200-1.)
So biodiversity keeps the world running. It has value and of itself, as well as for us. Raven, Erwin, and Wilson oblige us to think about the value of biodiversity for our own lives. The Ehrlichs’ rivet-popper trope makes this same point; by eliminating rivets, we play Russian roulette with global ecology and human futures: “It is likely that destruction of the rich complex of species in the Amazon basin could trigger rapid changes in global climate patterns. Agriculture remains heavily dependent on stable climate, and <span style="font-size: 16px;">human beings remain heavily dependent on food</span>. By the end of the century the extinction of perhaps a million species in the Amazon basin could have <span style="font-size: 16px;">entrained famines in which a billion human beings perished.</span> And if our species is very unlucky, the <span style="font-size: 16px;">famines could lead to a thermonuclear war, which could </span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">extinguish civilization</span>.” Elsewhere Ehrlich uses different particulars with no less drama: What then will happen if the current decimation of organic diversity continues? Crop yields will be more difficult to maintain in the face of climatic change, soil erosion , loss of dependable water supplies, decline of pollinators, and ever more serious assaults by pests. Conversion of productive land to wasteland will accelerate; deserts will continue their seemingly inexorable expansion. Air pollution will increase, and local climates will become harsher. Humanity will have to forgo many of the direct economic benefits it might have withdrawn from Earth's well­stocked genetic library. It might, for example, miss out on a cure for cancer; but that will make little difference. As ecosystem services falter, mortality from respiratory and epidemic disease, natural disasters, and especially famine will lower life expectancies to the point where can­cer (largely a disease of the elderly) will be unimportant. Humanity will bring upon itself consequences depressingly similar to those expected from a nuclear winter. Barring a nuclear conflict, it appears that civilization will disappear some time before the end of the next century - not with a bang but a whimper.



Pakistan Causes Nuclear war
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Pitt 09 </span>[William, NYT Correspondent, author, 5/8/9, “Unstable Pakistan Threatens the World”, <span style="font-family: Arial;">[[http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=commentary&article=2183]]</span>,]

But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep filled with troops today, killing five and wounding as many as 21, including several children who were waiting for a ride to school. Residents of the region where the attack took place are fleeing in terror as gunfire rings out around them, and government forces have been unable to quell the violence. Two regional government officials were beheaded by militants in retaliation for the killing of other militants by government forces. As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where we have come to expect such terrible events. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This</span>, unfortunately, <span style="font-size: 16px;">is a whole new ballgame</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">It is part of another conflict that is brewing, one which puts what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in deep shade, and which represents a grave and growing threat to us all.Pakistan is now trembling on the edge of violent chaos, and is doing so with nuclear weapons in its hip pocket, right in the middle of one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world</span>. The situation in brief: Pakistan for years has been a nation in turmoil, <span style="font-size: 16px;">run by a shaky government supported by a corrupted system, dominated by a blatantly criminal security service, and threatened by a large fundamentalist Islamic population with deep ties to the Taliban</span>in Afghanistan. <span style="font-size: 16px;">All thisis piled atop an ongoing standoff with neighboring India that has been the center of political gravity</span> in the region for more than half a century. The fact that <span style="font-size: 16px;">Pakistan, and India, and Russia, and China all possess nuclear weapons and share the same space means any ongoing or escalating violence over there has the real potential to crack open the very gates of Hell itself</span>.

More bandwidth and secure links are key to preventing data overflow – key to avoid naval collapse
Grace V. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Jean</span>, Journalist, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">11</span> [“Drone Sensor Data Will Overload Networks, Navy Officials Warn”, National Defense Magazine, NDIA Business and Technology Magazine, August, [[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2011/August/Pages/DroneSensorDataWillOverloadNetworks,NavyOfficialsWarn.aspx]]]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">The expected growth of unmanned systems at sea is raising concerns that the Navy’s networks are ill prepared to handle the commensurate flood of data that the sensors will produce</span>. "The Navy’s architecture is not designed to address the influx of sensors that is coming on,” said Chris Miller, executive director of the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic. The Navy’s maritime <span style="font-size: 16px;">intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance roadmap indicates that officials intend to field a fleet of unmanned undersea vehicles by the end of the decade along with a squadron of unmanned carrier-launched aircraft by 2018</span>. The fleet already is operating several robotic helicopters to support ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Somalia, and <span style="font-size: 16px;">those systems are producing a lot of data</span>, officials said at a recent naval IT conference in Vienna, Va. <span style="font-size: 16px;">“Information is exploding and much of it is coming from the sea,” said David Weddel</span>, assistant deputy chief of naval operations for information dominance. As the Navy fields unmanned systems, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">the demandfor bandwidth and data is going to increase by more than 1,000 percent,</span>// he said. “In the past, we always received more information [at sea] than we ever had to push back,” he said. “That equation has changed.” The MQ-8 Fire Scout, a vertical take-off and landing <span style="font-size: 16px;">unmanned aerial vehicle</span>, or VTUAV, <span style="font-size: 16px;">is producing a fair amount of data and that number is only going to increase as more systems hit the fleet</span>, Weddel said. There are two VTUAVs operating from frigates sailing off the coast of Somalia conducting anti-piracy operations and supporting special operations forces ashore. One was reportedly shot down in June over Libya, where it had been diverted to support NATO forces. Three more Fire Scouts are supporting troops in Afghanistan. Weddel said the Navy has plans to develop a follow-on to those aircraft. The medium-range maritime unmanned air system will carry heavier payloads and have longer endurance, he added. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Beneath the ocean, sailors are operating unmanned undersea vehicles called littoral battle space gliders that sense water temperature and salinity. The submersible robots are producing large amounts of data because they capture pictures of the ocean battle space</span>, said Weddel. Three of them deployed last year to the Gulf of Mexico to support government officials during the BP oil spill crisis. They were employed to help track the location and depth of the oil. These semi-autonomous vehicles and drones — in conjunction with other manned naval systems such as the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft — are expected to carry sophisticated sensors and other equipment to quickly provide sailors with pertinent battle information. “We’re all in on sensors,” said Miller. “But <span style="font-size: 16px;">what we haven’t done is balance out the equation and make sure I’ve got the bandwidth coming to my ships to make sure I can get that data off the ship</span>,” he said. Industry will offer <span style="font-size: 16px;">solutions</span> to <span style="font-size: 16px;">speed up data and processing on the network</span>, he added. While that is helpful, “my argument is, we need a bigger systems of systems architecture and discussion about what we need to go do,” he said. And <span style="font-size: 16px;">it is not only the drones and underwater robots driving up the demand for bandwidth and network capability. Ships themselves will too</span>, officials said. The Navy’s newest class of surface combatants, the littoral combat ship, will become increasingly dependent on Defense Department networks for reach back capability to attain operational support and intelligence from shore-based systems. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The ship was designed to operate with a small onboard crew of about 40 sailors and a support team ashore to take care of administrative duties, including maintenance and supply. As a result, </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">communications from</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;"> the ship back to shore is critical.</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;"> “So here you have a platform that moves at high speeds from hotspot to hotspot,</span>” said Rear Adm. Edward “Ned” Deets III, commander of the Naval Network Warfare Command. “How do you prepare the [commanding officer] and crew with the level of information and capability that they need for the next threat which, at the speed of operation of this ship, is in many cases simply three to four to five hours away?” <span style="font-size: 16px;">The challenge this presents to the Navy </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">is</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;"> the capacity to move information</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">— whether it’s satellite-based, line of sight-based, or within networks aboard ships — and to analyze the data. “An awful lot of data is going to fall on the cutting room floor if we can’t figure out how we can automate the data processing and data analysis</span>,” said Weddel. There also needs to be a discussion about how much information is stored aboard a ship and how much of it can be posted to a site or uploaded to another repository where it is retrievable via Defense Department networks. “It could be the marines on the beach, or maybe the SOF we’re supporting in the Horn of Africa. It’s not just about the Navy,” Weddel said. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Whatever network supports this must be able to form and reform very quickly, especially when it comes to data links between ships and the unmanned systems</span>, he added. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Data links are the “pipes” that systems use to communicate. Many data links are proprietary and limit the ability to share information among multiple sensors and networks.</span> “There’s nothing common about common data links, and it’s killing me,” said Weddel. <span style="font-size: 16px;">There are at least 11 different common data link programs and three additional ones for the Marine Corps, he pointed out. “It has to stop. I don’t have enough antennas onboard ship to do it, and </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">it’s hurting </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">our war fighting capability</span>//,” he said. The Navy is making plans to pursue a true common system beginning in 2013, he added. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The other challenge to consider is the Navy’s reliance upon satellites to transmit its communications globally. “Bandwidth for the time being is adequate. But </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">what happens when the bandwidth becomes limited or adversaries start jamming satellites</span>//?” Weddel said. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Potential enemies have realized how much the Defense Department depends upon space-based systems to conduct its business. The ability to jam satellites is available</span>, he pointed out. “So the question becomes, ‘How does the Navy maintain connectivity within the battle group?’” he said. The department is conducting a study for a joint airborne layer network that could substitute for jammed satellite networks. Officials intend to budget for the system in 2014. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Industry can help solve the Navy’s network challenge by automating some of the processes, designing common antennas and conforming to standard waveforms and capability. It can also address human factor issues, such as making the networked information easier for young sailors to manipulate and digest. Another challenge is information assurance — securing the information once it enters Navy networks</span>. A large part of that is imbuing into the Navy culture the idea that IT networks are combat systems, and that they need to be treated as such, said Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jonathan Greenert, who has been tapped to replace Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead, who is retiring.



U.S. seapower solves nuclear war and multiple scenarios for extinction
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">CONWAY ET AL 07</span> [James T., General, U.S. Marine Corps, Gary Roughead, Admiral, U.S. Navy, Thad W. Allen, Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, “A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower,” October, <span style="color: #4267b6; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.navy.mil/maritime/MaritimeStrategy.pdf]]</span>)]
This strategy reaffirms <span style="font-size: 16px;">the use of seapower to influence actions and activities at sea and ashore</span>. The expeditionary character and versatility of maritime forces provide the U.S. the asymmetric advantage of enlarging or contracting its military footprint in areas where access is denied or limited. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Permanent or prolonged basing of our military forces overseas often has unintended economic, social or political repercussions. The sea is a vast maneuver space, where the presence of maritime forces can be adjusted as conditions dictate to enable flexible approaches to escalation, de-escalation and deterrence of conflicts. The speed, flexibility, agility and scalability of maritime forces provide joint or combined force commanders a range of options for responding to crises.</span> Additionally, <span style="font-size: 16px;">integrated </span>maritime operations, either <span style="font-size: 16px;">within</span> formal alliance structures (such as the <span style="font-size: 16px;">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</span>) or more informal arrangements (such as the Global Maritime Partnership initiative), <span style="font-size: 16px;">send powerful messages to would-be aggressors t</span>hat we will act with others to ensure collective security and prosperity. United States seapower will be globally postured to secure our homeland and citizens from direct attack and to advance our interests around the world. As our security and prosperity are inextricably linked with those of others, U.S. maritime forces will be deployed <span style="font-size: 16px;">to protect and sustain the peaceful global system comprised of interdependent networks of trade, finance, information, law, people and governance</span>. We will employ the global reach, persistent presence, and operational flexibility inherent in U.S. seapower to accomplish six key tasks, or strategic imperatives. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Where tensions are high or where we wish to demonstrate to our friends and allies our commitment to security and stability, U.S. maritime forces will be characterized by regionally concentrated, forward-deployed task forces with the combat power to limit regional conflict, deter major power war, and should deterrence fail, win our Nation’s wars as part of a joint or combined campaign.</span> In addition, persistent, mission-tailored maritime forces will be globally distributed in order to contribute to homeland defense-in-depth, foster and sustain cooperative relationships with an expanding set of international partners, and prevent or mitigate disruptions and crises. Credible combat power will be continuously postured in the Western Pacific and the Arabian Gulf/Indian Ocean to protect our vital interests, assure our friends and allies of our continuing commitment to regional security, and deter and dissuade potential adversaries and peer competitors. This combat power can be selectively and rapidly repositioned to meet contingencies that may arise elsewhere. These forces will be sized and postured to fulfill the following strategic imperatives:Limit regional conflict with forward deployed, decisive maritime power. Today <span style="font-size: 16px;">regional conflict has ramifications far beyond the area of conflict. Humanitarian crises, violence spreading across borders, pandemics, and the interruption of vital resources are all possible when regional crises erupt</span>. While this strategy advocates a wide dispersal of networked maritime forces, <span style="font-size: 16px;">we cannot be everywhere, and we cannot act to mitigate all regional conflict. Where conflict threatens the global system and our national interests, maritime forces will be ready to respond alongside other elements of national and multi-national power, to give political leaders a range of options for deterrence, escalation and de-escalation. </span> Maritime forces that are persistently present and combat-ready provide the Nation’s primary forcible entry option in an era of declining access, <span style="font-size: 16px;">even as they provide the means for this Nation to respond quickly to other crises</span>. Whether over the horizon or powerfully arrayed in plain sight, maritime forces can <span style="font-size: 16px;">deter the ambitions of regional aggressors, assure friends and allies, gain and maintain access, and protect our citizens while working to sustain the global order</span>. Critical to this notion is the maintenance of a powerful fleet—ships, aircraft, Marine forces, and shore-based fleet activities—<span style="font-size: 16px;">capable of selectively controlling the seas, projecting power ashore, and protecting friendly forces and civilian populations from attack.</span>


===Advantage Two – China=== 
Growing Reliance on Information makes it the prime target for China. Military Communications will likely be exploited in a cyber war

Because platforms such a Worldview-1 and GeoEye-1 are commer- cial in nature, and not subject to expensive add-ons and countermeasures which would enhance their survivability, these <span style="font-size: 16px;">commercial satellites are highly vulnerable to potential PRC interference and destruction</span>. Indeed, <span style="font-size: 16px;">such satellites would present the PRC with an attractive target set in any future cross-strait crisis because the disabling of commercial satellites would serve a valuable military purpose without greatly escalating a crisis</span>. Theoretically the adversary would be blinded (at least partially) and yet would have no legal grounds to declare war. The <span style="font-size: 16px;">PRC employed just such a strategy in the 1995-96 Cross-Strait Missile Crisis</span>, using radar-jamming to blind a commercial SAR imagery satellite that was providing Taiwan with intelligence on PLA exercises and the PLA military buildup opposite Taiwan.234 //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Given</span>// this, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">government’s</span>// partial (and //<span style="font-size: 16px;">growing) reliance upon commercial satellites for</span>//imagery and //<span style="font-size: 16px;">communications certainly does represent an Achilles’ heellikely to be exploited by the PRC</span>//in any future conflict. How far such exploitation might go, and what affects it might have are subjects for the next chapter. In conclusion, this chapter has sought to describe the expanding U.S. reliance upon satellites, noting their economic value while primarily focusing on their military utility, to illustrate some of the ways space platforms are vital to the U.S. military’s revolution in military affairs. The Chinese ASAT test shows that the <span style="font-size: 16px;">U.S. military’s </span>unparalleled <span style="font-size: 16px;">space infrastructure</span>, while serving as an essential force-multiplier that gives the U.S. a tremendous edge in modern warfare, also <span style="font-size: 16px;">represents a weakness in the sense that it is particularly vulnerable to asymmetric interference and attack. This state of affairs is exacerbated as the U.S. military increasingly turns to commercial satellite providers</span> to offset budget overruns and scheduling delays in government-funded programs. Interestingly, the semi-classified military space budget did not drastically increase in the wake of the Chinese direct-assent ASAT test of last year despite the PRC action representing a significant, and troubling, alteration of both the PRC’s capabilities and intentions. We now turn to the next chapter to discuss the level of significance the Chinese development of counter-space weapons could have for U.S.-Sino relations in the coming years.



Cyber war reverses the nuclear taboo – new forms of war ensure accidental launch

The end of Cold War has led some to assume that <span style="font-size: 16px;">nuclear weapons</span>and nuclear deterrence <span style="font-size: 16px;">are passe.</span> Along with this, is a related <span style="font-size: 16px;">assumption that a revolution in high technology, conventional weaponry will accelerate the rate of nuclear political and military obsolescence. On the other hand, all concede that the "revolution in military affairs" is driven mostly by new technologies in information, communications, and electronics</span>. [1] New information and <span style="font-size: 16px;">communication technologies may enable new forms of war making, including information warfare, that are dysfunctional for deterrence stability with, or without, nuclear weapons. It is possible that the remnants of pax atomica will combine with attacks using the new strategies of information to produce an outcome no one favors: accidental or inadvertent nuclear war or escalation.</span> In order to proceed, we need a working definition of information warfare. A large literature offers candidate views on the concept of information warfare. [2] <span style="font-size: 16px;">For present purposes, information warfare can be defined as activities by one state or nonstate actor against another that attempt to disrupt, deceive, or destroy one or more of the following attributes of military or military related information</span>: (1) the physical aspects of information transfer or communication, such as landlines, <span style="font-size: 16px;">radio receivers, satellites</span>, commanders, and command posts, not to exclude the flow of electrons back and forth between senders and receivers; (2) <span style="font-size: 16px;">the communications contents, consisting of asserted facts, ideas, proposals, and other messages</span>; (3) the network of channels by which sender are receiver are connected and organizational behaviors influenced; (4) the security protocols that authenticate a message sender and/or enable senders and receivers to pass information back and forth without giving it away to the enemy; and, (5) <span style="font-size: 16px;">perseons in the security decision-making process, including their role perceptions and their images of the adversary that might be influenced by infowar. </span>



PLA is Building up it’s forces to target US ISR vulnerabilities – gives China upper hand in conflict
Alexander <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Neill</span>, head of the Asia Security Programme at the Royal United Services Institute, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">11</span> [“Viewpoint: A new Sino-US high-tech arms race?”, BBC News, Jan 11, [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-asia-pacific-12154991]]]
Beneath the veneer of official smiles and neatly choreographed handshakes at the defence summit in Beijing, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the Sino-US relationship remains fraught with uncertainty</span>. A year after military relations were frozen by Beijing in the wake of a $6.4bn (£4.1bn) arms package to Taiwan, the US request for a resumption of a substantial strategic dialogue has been given a lukewarm reception in Beijing. The People's Liberation Army's (PLA) appetite for engagement with the US has waned considerably over the last year. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Cementing its defence arrangement with Taiwan, and holding large-scale naval war games in China's back yard in recent months, the US has buttressed its alliances with its East Asian allies. These actions have fuelled resentment in China and fears of US military encirclement. US irritation is based on a recent spate of harassment by the PLA Navy and Chinese fishing vessels against the US Navy and its allies in the West Pacific</span>. The US is also frustrated with China's intransigence towards meaningful strategic dialogue on international security concerns, particularly while tension on the Korean peninsula remains high and nuclear proliferation by North Korea continues unchecked. But the Pentagon's visceral concern is its failure to detect the break-neck speed of Chinese military technological advances and its ability to curb an arms race in East Asia. 'Pressure point warfare' Despite recent headlines reporting the appearance of a Chinese stealth fighter prototype, of more concern to US military planners is the enabling technology that will produce the bite to China's military bark. This angst is focused on China's decade-long programme of military "informationisation" designed to leap-frog over US capabilities in the Pacific region. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The PLA is rapidly developing asymmetric warfare techniques against US command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance infrastructure, known as "C4ISR" in military parlance. </span>For China, with its inferior conventional military capabilities, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the key to gaining the upper hand in a conflict with the US is to gain dominance of the space theatre and to damage its digital nerve system</span>. China views space as a corner-stone of its future prosperity: a mandate from heaven for China's growth and military strength. For this reason, China is working hard to counter the Pentagon's monopoly in space and to build its own space-based deterrent. The <span style="font-size: 16px;">PLA's</span> doctrine of "pressure point warfare", a multi-layered approach using space, cyberspace and information operations alongside conventional capabilities is designed to cripple an adversary in one swift strike. This fast paced and high-tech military modernisation has led to the emergence of weapons systems and technology, which in certain theatres has <span style="font-size: 16px;">closed the military capability gap with the US considerably. These include directed energy, jamming and cyber attack technologies, designed to paralyse the US military machine</span>. The PLA has recently developed and successfully tested advanced anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons systems, demonstrating it can destroy or manoeuvre close to enemy satellites in space. ASAT weapons are part of a new genre of "assassin's mace" or surprise weapons aimed at the Pentagon's Achilles Heel in space and cyberspace. All of these capabilities require state of the art signals processing and communications systems, technology which China has been developing indigenously to create its own command and control architecture. Carrier fears <span style="font-size: 16px;">One of the most pressing concerns for the United States navy is the prospect of US aircraft carriers and other vessels being denied access to theatres of operation in the event that the US were dragged into a conflict over Taiwan or in support of its other Pacific allies.</span> Coined by Pentagon planners as China's "A2/AD" (Anti Access/Area Denial) strategy, the PLA would attempt to prevent US aircraft carriers from deploying to theatre, targeted by Chinese torpedoes, Cruise Missiles and Anti Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBMs). <span style="font-size: 16px;">PLA tacticians know that a successful strike against a moving US aircraft carrier requires advanced space-based targeting assets and an ability to penetrate the US ballistic missile defence umbrella</span>.



US-China relations collapse makes conflict inevitable – IR and empirics prove
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Zhang 11</span> (Baohui, Ph.D. in political science from the University of Texas in Austin , “The Security Dilemma in the U.S.-China Military Space Relationship, : Asian Survey, Vol. 51, No. 2 (March/April 2011), pp. 311-332”, April 2011, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/AS.2011.51.2.311]]</span>)
<span style="font-size: 16px;">China’s military space program and its strategies for space warfare have caused rising concerns in the United States.In fact, China’s military intentions in outer space have emerged as one of the central security issues between the two countries.</span>In November 2009, after the commander of the Chinese Air Force called the militarization of space “a historical inevitability,” General Kevin Chilton, head of the U.S. Strategic Command, urged China to explain the objectives of its rapidly advancing military space program.1 Indeed, in the wake of China’s January 2007 anti-satellite (ASAT) test, many U.S. experts have attempted to identify China’s motives. One driver of China’s military space program is its perception of a forthcoming revolution in military affairs. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) sees space as a new and critical dimension of future warfare. The comment by the commander of the Chinese Air Force captures this perception of the PLA.2 In addition,<span style="font-size: 16px;">China’s military space program is seen as part of a broad asymmetric strategy designed to offset conventional U.S. military advantages.</span> For example, as observed by Ashley J. Tellis in 2007,<span style="font-family: 'AGaramondPro-Regular','serif'; font-size: 14.6667px;"> “</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">China’s pursuit of counterspace capabilities </span>is not driven fundamentally by a desire to protest American space policies, and those of the George W. Bush administration in particular, but is<span style="font-size: 16px;">part of a considered strategy designed to counter the overall military capabilities of the United States.</span><span style="font-family: 'AGaramondPro-Regular','serif'; font-size: 14.6667px;">”</span><span style="font-family: 'AGaramondPro-Regular','serif'; font-size: 7.33333px;">3 </span>Richard J. Adams and Martin E. France, U.S. Air Force officers, contend that “Chinese interests in space weapons do not hinge on winning a potential U.S.-Chinese ASAT battle or participating in a space arms race.” Instead, they argue<span style="font-size: 16px;">, China’s military space program is driven by a desire to “counter the space-enabled advantage of U.S. conventional forces.”</span><span style="font-family: 'AGaramondPro-Regular','serif'; font-size: 7.33333px;">4 </span>This perspective implies that<span style="font-size: 16px;">given the</span><span style="font-family: 'AGaramondPro-Regular','serif'; font-size: 14.6667px;"> predicted </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">U.S. superiority in conventional warfare, China feels compelled to continue its offensive military space program.</span>Inevitably, this perspective sees China as the main instigator of a possible space arms race, whether implicitly or explicitly. China’s interpretation of the revolution in military affairs and its quest for asymmetric warfare capabilities are important for understanding the 2007 ASAT test. This article suggests that the Chinese military space program is also influenced by the security dilemma in international relations.<span style="font-size: 16px;">Due to the anarchic nature of the world order, “the search for security on the part of state A leads to insecurity for state B which therefore takes steps to increase its security leading in its turn to increased insecurity for state A and so on.”5 The military space relationship between China and the U.S. clearly embodies the tragedy of a security dilemma</span><span style="font-family: 'AGaramondPro-Regular','serif'; font-size: 14.6667px;">. </span>In many ways, the <span style="font-size: 16px;">current Chinese thinking on space warfare reflects China’s response to the perceived U.S. threat to its national securit</span>y. This response, in turn, has triggered American suspicion about China’s military intentions in outer space. Thus<span style="font-family: 'AGaramondPro-Regular','serif'; font-size: 14.6667px;">, </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">the security dilemma in the U.S.-China space relationship has inevitably led to measures and countermeasures</span><span style="font-family: 'AGaramondPro-Regular','serif'; font-size: 14.6667px;">. </span>

Satellite Vulnerability leads china to act offensively in space – triggers war over Taiwan
Chung-chian <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Teng</span> is Dean of the College of International Affairs at National Chengchi University <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Kuo-Hsiung <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Lee</span> is the director of the Natural Products Research Laboratories at UNC Chapel Hill <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">08</span> [“China's Militarization of Space: Motivations and Implications for U.S-Chinese Relations”, NCCU, Chapter 5: U.S. Response, Toward a “Cold War” in Space, pdf]
During the recent Iraq war, 68% of munitions were satellite guided, a massive increase from the merely 10% of satellite guided munitions used in the 1991 Iraq War.199 One senior Air Force officer said that thanks to satellite technology the U.S. no longer fights in the fog of war, but in a “huge cloud of electrons.”200 However, <span style="font-size: 16px;">because four-fifths of America’s military data is transmitted through unhardened commercial satellites, and a single Global Hawk unmanned surveillance drone flying over the middle east can consume several times more bandwidth than was used in the whole of the 1991 war against Iraq, Air Force officers commonly describe space as being America’s “Achilles Heel</span>.”201 Referring to China’s ASAT test, General Hamel of the Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center said “//<span style="font-size: 16px;">if they take </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">our asymmetric advantage in space, we go from an information age war machine to an industrial age war machine…shifting the balance, the edge will go to the adversary</span>//.” Many specialists also argue that aside from the U.S. military dependency on orbital space, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. economy, and in turn, much of the world economy, is also rapidly becoming dependent on space-based system</span>s. They posit that, in effect, the U.S. is now a “space faring” nation whose very way of life is tied to the myriad capabilities provided by the orbital space medium.203 War games conducted as part of U.S. national security protocols, such as the Army-After-Next, Navy Global and Air Force Global Engagement series, Space Game 2 and Schriever 1 & 2, as well as the privately conducted “DEADSATS” war games, conducted from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, confirm this view. According to some space experts who were intimately involved with the war games, the exercises exposed “a critical national Achilles heel that politicians, economists and corporate CEOs have largely ignored…<span style="font-size: 16px;">losses in space can quickly affect the economic, social, and national security fabric not only of the united States, but of the entire world</span>.”204 These experts further speculate that “<span style="font-size: 16px;">large military powers,” such as the United States, could “be held hostage by the unknowns inherent in a new kind of war.</span>”205 <span style="font-size: 16px;">These concerns are directly linked with China’s ASAT threat and their potential applicability in any future U.S.-Sino conflict. Clearly any possible U.S. military contingency in the Taiwan Straits would require secure satellites as the U.S. becomes ever more reliant upon its space systems</span>. Moreover, <span style="font-size: 16px;">reconnaissance satellites are thought to limit the risk inherent in the build-up of forces that both the PRC and the U.S. could be expected to deploy to the region in the event of a crisis</span>.206 However, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">if the U.S. was blinded as the result of a preemptive Chinese ASAT attack, the conflict could quickly escalate to a dangerous level</span>//. According to two experts on the subject, “if there is a great- power war in the twenty-first century, our crystal ball says that it will be between the United States and China over Taiwan, with a very serious potential for a horrible escalatory process.”207 This underscores the gravity of the topic as well as the negative impact the Chinese shift towards fielding counter-space weapons could have.



Strong and diverse ISR and Satellite capabilities deter short term China Attack
Chung-chian <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Teng</span> is Dean of the College of International Affairs at National Chengchi University <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Kuo-Hsiung <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Lee</span> is the director of the Natural Products Research Laboratories at UNC Chapel Hill <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">08</span> [“China's Militarization of Space: Motivations and Implications for U.S-Chinese Relations”, NCCU, Chapter Six: Space Militarization: Implications for U.S.-Chinese Relations, pdf]
In many ways <span style="font-size: 16px;">China’s counter-space platforms</span>, such as its already operational directed-energy, ground-based lasers and its direct-ascent, solid-fueled (and therefore rapidly deployable) ASAT missiles that can be launched from any of China’s hundreds of road-mobile, SRBM and MRMB launchers, already <span style="font-size: 16px;">represent a real threat to U.S. forces</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This threat will only grow and ramify with time, perhaps geometrically so, as the PRC continues to grow its young stock of operational</span> Dong Feng-31 (DF-31) road-mobile <span style="font-size: 16px;">ICBMs</span>, which while generally thought to be tipped with 400 kiloton nuclear <span style="font-size: 16px;">warheads</span>,235 <span style="font-size: 16px;">could be modified to attack U.S. national security satellites in GEO</span> with KKVs or future co-orbital killer satellites, EMP weapons and high-powered microwave weapons, all of which are under development. In the interim, General Cartwright’s statement, mentioned previously, that the PRC would be able to destroy all the U.S. reconnaissance satellites in LEO by 2010 appears to be correct.236 According to Desmond Ball, it would require approximately 20 ASAT missiles of the type that destroyed FY-1C last year to destroy 6-7 LEO satellites, which is the number of current U.S. Crystal and Lacrosse space vehicles currently believed to be in orbit. Assuming they passed over or near the PRC, U.S. spy satellites would indeed be vulnerable to China’s ASAT weapons by 2010, as 20 operational, direct-ascent ASAT missiles would presumably be easy enough to field by that time given that the PRC is already mass-producing well over a hundred similar missile platforms a year. All one would need to modify would be the warhead and guidance package, both of which have been already been proven and have been operational as of January 11, 2007.237 The PLA can be expected to continue to develop its ASAT guidance package (which is reportedly radar based and therefore highly vulnerable to jamming) in order to overcome U.S. defense satellites’ built-in counter-measures, which are thought to be quite technologically impressive.238 Therefore the PRC already has an operational ASAT capability, and one that is likely to grow in sophistication and capability. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This will add to the U.S. imperative to counter and deter the Chinese counter-space weapons, and further fuel the U.S.-Sino cold war style build-up in space mentioned previously. In the near-term China is unlikely to be able to compete directly with the U.S., and therefore will continue its asymmetric efforts to exploit the U.S. vulnerability in space.</span> Looking more distantly, <span style="font-size: 16px;">however, one can forecast a situation where China is competing with the U.S. in space</span>(and <span style="font-size: 16px;">on terra firma</span>) as more of a peer-competitor. In such a situation, <span style="font-size: 16px;">whereby there is a relative balance of power and mutual reliance upon orbital space, one could foresee increased stability and something akin to the détente that characterized the later stages of the cold war and led to U.S.-Soviet cooperation in outer space</span>. However, as noted by a recent study, it will be a long time before the PRC can be considered a true peer competitor of the U.S. in space.239 //<span style="font-size: 16px;">In the interim</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">, there is a strong possibility that the relationship between the two powers will be unstable, withpotential global repercussions</span>//. China’s irresponsible actions in space only underscore that growing trend, and point to a disturbing strategic environment in the years ahead. That said, the likely U.S. response to any ASAT attack on an American government satellite, which would be viewed much in the same way that an attack on U.S. terrestrial forces would be (i.e. an act of war), probably rule it out barring a massive miscalculation on the part of the Chinese leadership or a Chinese decision to engage in a Pearl Harbor style sneak attack. The danger lies in the fact that as the PRC’s counter-space capabilities grow and become more subtle with the development of micro-satellites, nano-satellites and other less conspicuous ASAT platforms which could potentially interfere with U.S. satellites without going so far as destroying them, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S.-Sino relationship in space may become more unstable because the potential Chinese menu of options would be increasingly tempting</span>, offering as it would ever more possibilities at a time when the U.S. reliance upon satellites was ever greater. To <span style="font-size: 16px;">offset this scenario</span>, which would mix a dangerous brew of Chinese capabilities with U.S. vulnerabilities in a situation <span style="font-size: 16px;">that could escalate rapidly to general war, the U.S. can be expected to not only diversify and strengthen its orbital assets, but also to develop better air-breathing reconnaissance platforms</span>, such as smaller, stealthier Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV) with longer dwell times in order to have the ability to rapidly restore lost satellite coverage in a crisis. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This U.S. diversification and multiplication of reconnaissance assets would thereby both strengthen the durability of its C4ISR network and force the PRC to plan for more targets, thus making it a less tempting option and creating an environment for better deterrence</span>. Let us now conclude this chapter with a summation and a brief policy suggestion.

US-China War over Taiwan goes nuclear – most likely scenario for conflict
Richard C. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Bush</span>, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and director of its Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Michael E. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">O'Hanlon</span>, senior fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution, where he specializes in U.S. defense strategy, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">07</span> [“A war like no other: the truth about China's challenge to America”, p. 186, google books]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">If war resulted, escalation pressures would be enormous</span>. It would be the first significant war between nuclear weapons states in world history. And the nuclear arsenals of the two sides could, as unreasonable and illogical as it sounds, come into play. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Nuclear exchanges</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;"> could even result</span>//. At a time when <span style="font-size: 16px;">the threat of superpower nuclear war has become much less vivid in the public eye</span> due to the end of the Cold War, <span style="font-size: 16px;">a Taiwan crisis could—ironically enough—quickly create </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">the most serious nuclear risk </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">since the Cuban Missile Crisis</span>. The conclusion is not intended to be melodramatic. Even in the event of war, the risk of nuclear conflagration would be be much less than fifty-fifty, since both sides would surely recognize the dangers. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">crises have dynamics all their own</span>. What neither side would see as desirable could nonetheless occur as the fog of war impeded accurate and timely <span style="font-size: 16px;">information flows and clouded leaders’ judgments—and</span> as <span style="font-size: 16px;">the loss of lives raised the stakes to the point where neither Beijing nor Washington could easily back down</span>. In addition, the war plans of the two sides could create momentum of their own. Although details are classified (and always changing in any even), <span style="font-size: 16px;">in the past these war plans apparently have called for hastier escalation than political leaders generally appreciate</span>. This may have changed of late, and certainly recent American commanders in the region have been sensitive to the need to build positive relationships with China and to avoid assuming that conflict would quickly escalate. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">predisposition to restraint may not easily survive direct combat with a major military power; arguments in favor of rapid escalation will be powerful</span>, whether or not the carry the day. Leaders in Taiwan, China, and the United States need to think these issues through thoroughly in advance—for the sake of their war plans, their diplomacy, and their politics. They must figure out how to avoid escalation in any serious crisis or war that beings—for once the three parties get to that point, <span style="font-size: 16px;">avoiding all-out U.S.-China war is more important than other realistic concerns</span>. Indeed, it is so paramount in importance that Taipei, Beijing, and Washington must avoid the temptation to manufacture crises or play politics with the independence of sovereignty issues.




===Contention Three – Solvency=== 
TSAT secures All Military Satellite Systems – Anti-jamming, bandwidth, on the move communications
Alec <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Klein</span>, award-winning investigative business journalism, Journalism Prof Northwestern, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">08</span> [“Weapons Upgrade Faces Big Hurdles; Problems With Wireless Technology May Threaten Army's Ambitious Plan”, Washington Post, April 8, [[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Sci/sci.military.naval/2008-04/msg00764.html]]]
At risk also is <span style="font-size: 16px;">the development of the Transformational Satellite Communications program, or TSAT, an Air Force project that is supposed to work with Future Combat Systems.</span> The Defense Department is planning to cut about $4 billion of the TSAT budget over the next five years, partly because of congressional concerns about an expensive and technical project that already has been cut, delayed and restructured. The Air Force has yet to select a contractor for the project, though Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the two leading contenders, have both been working on development contracts. <span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT would be about 100 times faster than military satellites in orbit now, Air Force officials say. That's to an extent because the satellites would take advantage of the latest Internet technology to reroute communications traffic more efficiently, they say</span>. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">is expected to also provide more securely encrypted communications for Future Combat Systems to prevent enemies from intercepting or jamming signals</span>//. Until recently, military officials said the program would launch its first satellite in 2016, though now they say the schedule is uncertain. According to a 2006 report, the GAO said TSAT began without sufficiently mature technology, noting that costs have increased and the timetable has been delayed. Before the latest cutbacks, according to the Air Force, the program had increased by about $8 billion, or 50 percent, to $24 billion, including inflation. The new cutbacks will defer work, delaying the timetable and adding to the program's overall expense because of "the costs associated with extending the contract to perform necessary work," the military said. But Richard Pino, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the Air Force's TSAT program director, said "the technologies are all at the right levels of maturity."</span> Boeing's Muilenburg said the prospect of additional cuts should not pose a problem for Future Combat Systems. In lieu of TSAT, he said that the Army program could use current military and commercial satellites. Loren B. Thompson, a defense consultant at the Lexington Institute, a public policy think tank, said, however, that <span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT "is crucial to the secure networking capabilities that underpin" Future Combat Systems. Given the cutbacks, he said, "If TSAT collapses, which looks like a distinct possibility, soldiers may have to rely on links that are harder to access on the move, more vulnerable to jamming and interceptions, and offer nowhere near as much bandwidth</span>." Cristina Chaplain, who oversees the GAO's review of space systems, also said that //<span style="font-size: 16px;">"TSAT was being designed to support communications on the move, whereas other programs don't do that to the extent that's needed by" Future Combat Systems</span>//. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sorenson, the Army's chief information officer, <span style="font-size: 16px;">acknowledges that the development of TSAT and the other complementary programs represent a "high risk," but he said the military is attempting to manage that risk by developing the programs incrementally</span>. Rickey E. Smith, <span style="font-size: 16px;">a retired Army colonel who is part of the military team designing how Future Combat Systems will be used, said that if the complementary programs fail, the Army project would certainly be impacted, but so would other military services that depend on these technologies. </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">And he said that while the GAO does good work, "They've never seen a program they liked</span>//."

NCW impossible without TSATs – space is key
James W. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Canan</span>, former senior editor of Air Force Magazine, 06 [“Timing in Battle: The T-Sat Edge”, AEROSPACE AMERICA/JANUARY 20<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">06,</span> [[http://www.aiaa.org/Aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_Jan06_CAN.pdf|www.aiaa.org/Aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_Jan06_CAN.pdf]], mcG]
<span style="color: #094b98;">B</span>y all accounts, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the success of the Pentagon’s ambitious plan to transform the U.S. military into a network-centric force is riding on the</span> transformational satellite communications system (<span style="font-size: 16px;">T-Sat</span>) now in development. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Defense planners are convinced that full-scale military transformation and network-centric operations will be impossible to achieve without the spaceborne communications that the revolutionary T-Sat constellation would provide.The military has begun its transition to highly mobile, fast-reaction, quick-strike, netcentric forces that include increasing numbers of autonomous or semiautonomous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).It</span> therefore <span style="font-size: 16px;">requires ultrareliable, superswift communications among all sorts of sensor systems, weapons platforms, and command posts in the air, on land, and at sea around the globe. T-Sats will be the space element</span>,<span style="font-size: 16px;">and the sine qua non, of the military’s planned GIG </span>(global information grid)—its “Internet in the sky.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Thus the T-Sat system is seen as “the cornerstone of [the Defense Dept.’s] future information operations</span>,” <span style="font-size: 16px;">the “centerpiece of our future global communications network,” and “the heart of the DOD net-centric operations environment concept essential to all future operations,”</span> a Pentagon document proclaims.
TSAT is specifically key to Solve bandwidth Shortages– Current Satellite communications don’t meet ISR needs
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">JDSB 8</span> [Report of the Joint Defense Science Board Intelligence Science Board Task Force on Integrating Sensor-Collected Intelligence, November, [[http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/dsb/sensors.pdf]]]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Just as the military and intelligence communities have transformed the way they operate, TSAT will transform the way they communicate</span>. As shown in figure E-12, <span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT will provide a dramatic increase in capacity and capability over </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">existing</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;"> and interim </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">satellite</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">communications</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;"> resources</span>. Depending on circumstances, <span style="font-size: 16px;">military forces often operate from unimproved and disadvantaged locations world-wide, are highly mobile, and depend heavily on reach-back for near-real time intelligence, imagery, and logistical information as well as inter-unit cooperation and support. </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">The greatly expanded use of UAVs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and for direct target engagement has placed extraordinary demands on the current SATCOM system. TSAT will mitigate those demands and further operational flexibility</span>//. The TSAT system is essential to enhancing military and intelligence operations. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Without TSAT</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">, mobile land forces and Navy ships will lack sufficient assured ISR communications</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;"> capacity, and the Military and IC will be unable to move and fully benefit from the large and growing quantity of data generated by new airborne and space ISR systems</span>. TSAT exemplifies the promise of the TCA’s enhanced capabilities and is a critical element of the transformation in military and intelligence operations.



TSAT’s integrate ISR capabilities so that data can be analyzed faster, more effectively, securely, and without backlog
Richard <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Best</span>, National Defense Specialist, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">11</span> [CRS Report for Congress Prepared for Members and Committees of Congress: Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Acquisition: Issues for Congress, pdf]
The committee report also addressed use of <span style="font-size: 16px;">commercial imagery and statutes</span> and regulations governing space commerce. Members of the committee’s Minority criticized several aspects of the report and maintained that it <span style="font-size: 16px;">failed to “address the importance of integrated ground systems for tasking, processing, exploitation and dissemination</span>.”47 In November 2008 a Joint Defense Science Board and Intelligence Science Board task force on integrating sensor-collected intelligence produced a report looking at various flaws in current ISR efforts that extend beyond acquisition issues. It argued that <span style="font-size: 16px;">ISR efforts can be better improved by integrating data from multiple sensors rather than by improving the design and performance of single sensors</span>. In making this argument the task force pointed to structural issues that complicate such data integration. To accomplish this goal the task force recommended ensuring the inclusion of meta-data (or tags that describe specific data that can in turn be searchable whereas the data itself may not be) that can allow identification of information of specific interest. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The task force’s emphasis on better ways to access and analyze data is influenced by the vast expansion in data available and in many cases never exploited</span>. It tended to favor a larger number of less sophisticated systems and achieve increased performance by integrating data from multiple sensors and platforms.48 <span style="font-size: 16px;">Significant problems derive from limitations on the dissemination of collected data. Currently, meta-data are not consistently applied and tags are not consistent from agency to agency</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Military commanders demand much larger quantities and more sophisticated types of intelligence</span>(especially tactical imagery), <span style="font-size: 16px;">but in many cases are unaware of and incapable of accessing data</span>available throughout the intelligence community<span style="font-family: Arial;">. “</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">The number of images and signal intercepts are well beyond the capacity of the existing analyst community so there are huge backlogs for translators and image interpreters and much of the collected data are never reviewed</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. </span>Further, decision makers and intelligence analyst have difficulty knowing what information is available.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Although an enormous number of full-motion video missions in support of tactical commanders has been conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span>the task force suggested that <span style="font-size: 16px;">surveillance has often been episodic and continuing coverage of a given region had not alwaysbeen possible</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span>The task force report emphasized that the//<span style="font-size: 16px;">ISR concept encompasses more than platforms for collection</span>//<span style="font-family: Arial;">. </span>It noted that DOD has developed the Global Information Grid which includes a high-speed communications network of various ground, air and space components<span style="font-family: Arial;">. </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">There is a need, according to the task force, for better ways for tactical commanders to access this information “on the move</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">” </span>and thus it emphasized the advantages of assured and //<span style="font-size: 16px;">accessible communications as would be made available by the redundant and complementary communications capabilities terrestrial fiber, government and civilian communications satellites, networks built and maintained by specific agencies. (The task force advocated the Transformational Satellite System</span>//<span style="font-family: Arial;">(</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">) to provide links to the fiber network to mobile and fixed theater command</span>//<span style="font-family: Arial;">s. </span>TSAT was subsequently killed by DOD because it was considered duplicative.) A key goal should be, according to the Task Force, to ensure that <span style="font-size: 16px;">future communications systems adhere to interoperability standards to ensure that they can support joint and international operations</span>as wel las “reach back” to U.S. agencies for analytical support. <span style="font-family: Arial;">The </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">essential concern of the task force was to ensure that the ongoing proliferation of platforms and sensors be matched by sufficient communications capabilities to enable their use.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Currently, they found that “Our </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">rapidly growing airborne ISR collection capabilities are not in balance with supporting communications.</span>//

<span style="font-size: 16px;">To achieve Information superiority, Joint Force Commanders must have the right information at the right place at the right time in order to make the best decisions</span> to advance and protect U.S. National Security interests. <span style="font-size: 16px;">An essential enabler towards that end is sufficient wideband communications connectivity. Current Department of Defense (DoD) wideband communications capabilities are insufficient</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The challenge is to dedicate sufficient resources in the most efficient manner to meet this growing need in the face of severe time pressure.</span> The reality is that <span style="font-size: 16px;">the current operational environment demonstrates the lack of an integrated architecture that provides robust communications to the lowest war fighting echelons under the most adverse conditions. </span>The <span style="font-size: 16px;">current fight and future threat require the network transport to evolve to a multi layered solution </span>(terrestrial –air-space). <span style="font-size: 16px;">Greater connectivity will expand situational awareness and facilitate communications among all types of modular brigades enabling them to enjoy greater mobility</span>, especially if communications can be maintained while on the move and in austere environments.

TSATs can be implemented efficiently and effectively - All Infrastructure is there – extensive efforts made in predevelopment phase
James W. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Canan</span>, former senior editor of Air Force Magazine, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">06</span> [“Timing in Battle: The T-Sat Edge”, AEROSPACE AMERICA/JANUARY 2006, [[http://www.aiaa.org/Aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_Jan06_CAN.pdf|www.aiaa.org/Aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_Jan06_CAN.pdf]], mcG]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Some officials have expressed concern that difficulties in mastering the technological intricacies of the signal processor/router may prevent its full development in time for the first scheduled T-Sat</span>launch. But Meink appears optimistic. “<span style="font-size: 16px;">From a technology standpoint, I think we’re in pretty good shape</span>,” says the program manager. He notes that the <span style="font-size: 16px;">contractors have considerable experience with similar technology in so-called heritage satellites</span>. “I’m not saying that any of this is easy to do,” Meink asserts. “We still have a lot of work to do, but <span style="font-size: 16px;">we’re meeting our objectives</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">We’re either on or ahead of schedule on the technologies. We’ve had a number of demonstrations in the lasercom and processor/router areas</span>. The contractors are meeting what they set out to do.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Risk reduction has very high priority in the T-Sat design/development phase. Meink says the T-Sat program was carefully configured from the beginning to avoid the problems of hasty and haphazard structuring</span> that have plagued some other space programs in recent years. “<span style="font-size: 16px;">We’ve taken more time than normal in the early part of the program to make sure that we’ve gotten this right, to ensure that the technology has matured to a higher level than usual in going into development</span>,” he says. He also notes that <span style="font-size: 16px;">the program will involve the independent, noncontractor testing of all advanced technology elements.</span>




Interoperability makes their generic NCW and GIG turns irrelevant – new guidance programs ensure plan solves
Clay <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Wilson</span>, Specialist in Technology and National Security Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">07</span> [“Network Centric Operations: Background and Oversight Issues for Congress”, CRS report for Congress, march 15, pdf, mcG]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">NCO is highly dependent on the interoperability of communications equipment, data, and software to enable networking of people, sensors, and manned and unmanned platforms</span>. Parts of NCO technology rely on lineof-sight radio transmission for microwave or infrared signals, or laser beams. Other parts of the technology aggregate information for transmission through larger network trunks for global distribution via fiber optic cables, microwave towers, or both lowaltitude and high-altitude satellites. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The designs for this technology must enable rapid communications between individuals in all services, and rapid sharing of data and information between mobile platforms and sensors used by all military services</span>.60 The <span style="font-size: 16px;">architectures must also have the ability to dynamically self-heal and re-form the network when one or more communications nodes are interrupted. DOD officials have noted that the new military Global Information Grid (GIG) must be also designed to interoperate securely with the networks of other organizations outside of DOD</span>, including state and local governments, multinational military commands, and the commercial and research communities.61<span style="font-size: 16px;">Some observers question whether the U.S. military can achieve true network and systems interoperability among all services. DOD reportedly intends to integrate the architectures of network systems used by all branches of the military to create a network centric capability linked to the GIG</span>(seesectionbelow). Tohelpaccomplish this integration, the <span style="font-size: 16px;">DOD Joint Staff has created a new Force Capability Board (FCB) to monitor NCO programs for mismatches in funding, or mismatches in capability</span>. When an issue is detected, the FCB reports to the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, which then provides guidance during budget deliberations at the Pentagon.62

<span style="font-size: 16px;">With TSAT, everything changes. While WGS and AEHF are evolutionary gains in capability and capacity, TSAT is truly transformation. Certainly, TSAT is more of the same in some respects; </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT will offer a tenfold increase in capacity over AEHF</span>//. <span style="font-size: 16px;">However, when you consider IP routing in space, the incredible gains as the result of laser communications, the efficiency delivered through dynamic bandwidth allocation (you get the bandwidth you need, when you need it) and T1 (1.544 Mbs) date rates for protected comm-on-the-move users with small diameter antennas, </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT will change the way we fight, coordinate, collaborate, maneuve</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">r</span>//—I could go on and on. <span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT will move more data, more protected data, to more users, while on the move.

**Information centric warfare is inevitable – just a question of effectiveness – 2 Internals**
**1. Operation Integration in the status quo**
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">DSB</span>, Federal Advisory Committee established to provide independent advice to the Secretary of Defense, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">07</span> [“Information Management for Net-Centric Operations”, //Volume II Operations Panel Report,// April 2007, pdf, mcG]

One of the defining aspects of today’s military environment is that <span style="font-size: 16px;">the Untied States has moved well beyond joint operations.</span> Today’s <span style="font-size: 16px;">operations are fully integrated with key interagency</span>, state and local government, alliance, coalition, host nation, international, and nongovernmental organizations and actors. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Each of these actors generally operates on its own distinct networ</span>k, <span style="font-size: 16px;">although</span> sustained <span style="font-size: 16px;">operations</span> during the past decade in the Balkans and now in Iraq and Afghanistan <span style="font-size: 16px;">have led to the development of tools and arrangements for information sharing</span>and collaboration. <span style="font-size: 16px;">These efforts, however, have often been ad hoc and have not allowed for the true integration of all elements of national and international power.Because future contingencies will almost certainly require collaboration of U.S. forces with interagency, coalition, and nongovernmental actors</span>, <span style="font-size: 16px;">DOD must work to improve and institutionalize its ability to work effectively with partners in all stages of combat</span>, stabilization, and reconstruction. <span style="font-size: 16px;">CENTRIXS</span>, for example, <span style="font-size: 16px;">has been the vehicle for collaboration</span> between U.S. and coalition forces during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. CENTRIXS has been successful in many ways, <span style="font-size: 16px;">but it is limited. It does address information sharing with non-military partners, because it will not allow for U.S. and coalition forces to plan and operate on the same network.</span> Although <span style="font-size: 16px;">it is vital for operational security reasons that U.S. forces maintain this firewall between U.S. military networks</span>and the networks of coalition (with the partial exception of the United Kingdom and Australia) and non-military partners, it is equally vital that the department work to find ways to improve the current situation in this area. Technical solutions will be helpful in this regard, but policy and process solutions are likely to be of equal or greater importance.
**2. Adapting to Adversaries**
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">DSB</span>, Federal Advisory Committee established to provide independent advice to the Secretary of Defense, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">07</span> [“Information Management for Net-Centric Operations”, Volume II Operations Panel Report, April 2007, pdf, mcG]
The <span style="font-size: 16px;">United States military steadily transformed during the latter part of the 20th century by an ever increasing reliance on information</span>networks and their ability to provide wider access to information and to support collaboration. Impressive gains in the usability, usefulness and availability of all forms of information have improved the effectiveness of military operations. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Our increasing ability to leverage information and networking will be a critical enabling factor in developing better ways to work with others in the USG and with both coalition and nontraditional partners</span> as we, collectively, undertake the challenging missions of the 21“ Century. Today a Company Commander can control a Division’s worth of ﬁrepower, tagging and tracking systems promise to signiﬁcantly improve the logistics chain and the improved availability of intelligence information and greater connectivity between sensors and shooters has increased the effectiveness of our forces and enhanced their security. During the past ten years, <span style="font-size: 16px;">we have seen the evolution of military missions driven by adaptive adversaries who recognize our increasing dependence on information networks.</span> Going forward, transfonnation must focus on addressing the stresses imposed by <span style="font-size: 16px;">21“ Century mission challenges associated with stabilization and reconstruction operations in urban and unconventional enviromnents</span> and responses to unforeseen events with catastrophic consequences. Information and the ability that networks provide to make this information available to those who need it, as well as the ability for individuals and organizations to collaborate, are the lifeblood of military and civil-military operations. The quality, reliability, availability, timeliness, discoverability, relevance, and security of information and interactions among individuals and organizations across the enterprise (warﬁghting, with business and <span style="font-size: 16px;">intelligence support) will have profound consequences for successful mission execution.</span>


**Other countries are pursuing NCW – US needs to secure hegemonic advantage by acting first – key to ground and air power**
John J. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Garstka</span>, assistant director for concepts and operations in the Office of Force Transformation, Office of the Secretary of Defense. He has spoken and written extensively on the topic of warfare in the information age, 20<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">03</span> [“Network-Centric Warfare Offers Warfighting Advantage”, Signal Online, May, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=235&zoneid=62]]</span>, mcG]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Datalinks are the new weapon of the information age</span>. The term network-centric warfare broadly describes the combination of emerging tactics, techniques and procedures that a networked force can employ to create a decisive warfighting advantage. According to John Keegan, author of A History of Warfare, it is similar to the significant warfighting developments of the industrial age and agrarian age in that <span style="font-size: 16px;">network-centric warfare seeks to exploit an order of magnitude change in an underlying source of power to increase warfighting advantage dramatically.</span>Paula Kaufman, in an article she wrote for IEEE Spectrum, agrees with this opinion<span style="font-size: 16px;">. In the industrial age, power was primarily derived from mass and the sources of power for moving mass. In the information age, power is increasingly derived from information sharing, information access and speed,</span> she says. The advantages network-centric warfare brings to the battlespace are particularly relevant to the tactical and operational levels of war, but they impact all levels of military activity from the tactical to the strategic. Although <span style="font-size: 16px;">the construct of an information advantage may seem somewhat intangible, it can be measured, and its impact on military operations can be evaluated in terms of mission effectiveness, survivability and lethality</span>—coins of the realm used by warfighters across the ages. Evidence of the power of network-centric warfare accumulated from a wide range of activities, including combat operations, training events, exercises and demonstrations, continues to strengthen and reinforce its existing tenets. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A U.S. Defense Department 2001 report to Congress about network-centric warfare enumerates several specific points: A robustly networked force improves information sharing; information sharing and collaboration enhances the quality of information and shared situational awareness; shared situational awareness enables collaboration and self-synchronization and enhances sustainability and speed of command; and these in turn dramatically increase mission effectiveness. </span>Although the margin of victory has varied across mission areas, the outcome has consistently been decisive in favor of forces that are robustly networked. In some tactical engagements, <span style="font-size: 16px;">superior platforms were decisively defeated by less capable platforms that leveraged the order of magnitude improvement in information sharing that networking enables.</span> In other engagements, digitized and networked ground forces with a reduced number of platforms were able to substitute information for mass and outperform units that had fought with a larger number of platforms not similarly digitized and networked. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Even more impressive, the combination of networked and digitized ground and air forces was able to defeat an opposition force decisively with unprecedented lethality by creating and leveraging an information advantage</span>. Most recently, military operations in support of operation Enduring Freedom highlighted the emergence of near-real-time information sharing as a source of warfighting advantage. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The source of power was not new platforms, but rather the networking of the legacy platforms with special operations forces</span> (SOF). The extent to which ground-based SOF were able to share precision information with command and control aircraft and fighter, bomber and attack aircraft was unprecedented in military operations. It represented an order of magnitude increase in information sharing over what had been previously demonstrated anywhere in the world in combat operations. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Two of the more noteworthy and documented examples of the power of network-centric warfare are drawn from the air-to-air mission. In this mission area, a major contributor to enhanced survivability and lethality is an increase in shared situational awareness</span> and enhanced situational understanding. With audio-only communications, p<span style="font-size: 16px;">ilots and controllers must share information</span>generated by onboard sensors about opposing forces as well as their own position and status via voice. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Communicating the minimum essential information required to take offensive or defensive actions takes time, and the resulting situational awareness can often differ significantly from reality</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">In contrast, when datalinks are employed on fighter aircraft, digital information on blue and red forces is shared instantaneously, enabling all participants to share a common tactical picture. This improved information position constitutes a significant information advantage vis-à-vis an adversary fighting with voice-only communications. This information advantage in turn enables a cognitive advantage in the form of dramatically increased shared situational awareness and enhanced situational understanding. The result is that pilots flying datalink-equipped aircraft can achieve much higher levels of shared situational awareness and understanding on a timeline previously unachievable with voice-only communications. They can translate these advantages into increased survivability and lethality. One of the best examples of how networking and digitization can be leveraged to create an information advantage took place in a training exercise in the mid-1990s when Royal Air Force (RAF) Tornado aircraft from U.K. 29 Squadron with tactical datalinks defeated U.S. Air Force F-15Cs with voice-only communications in a series of air-to-air engagements that took place during a red flag exercise in the airspace over the Nellis Air Force Base range. Historically, the most favorable outcome that the absolute best RAF pilots could manage when flying against F-15Cs was a draw. However, when the RAF introduced a datalink in the form of Link-16, U.K. 29 Squadron pilots, flying with new innovative tactics, were able to increase their kill ratio over the F-15C equipped with voice-only communications to approximately 4-to-1. The power of information sharing to increase survivability and lethality in the air-to-air mission was substantiated by the Air Force again in the mid-1990s during a joint tactical information distribution system (JTIDS) operational special project. Air Force pilots flying F-15Cs with and without datalinks clearly demonstrated an order of magnitude increase in information sharing enabled by the datalinks. This operational special project consisted of hundreds of tactical engagements, ranging in size from two-versus-two to eight-versus-16 aircraft, which were conducted during day and night conditions. During the more than 12,000 sorties and more than 19,000 flying hours, the average kill ratio for F-15Cs equipped with datalinks increased by more than 150 percent over F-15Cs fighting with voice-only communications, according to a JTIDS operational special project report to Congress. An analysis of the growing body of evidence highlights a very strong relationship between information advantage, cognitive advantage and increased lethality and survivability at the tactical level. It shows that these relationships are not unique to the air-to-air mission but rather that they were demonstrated first in this mission area as a result of the relative maturity of the application of networking technology in this arena. This same story line of increased warfighting effectiveness enabled by networking has been played out in counter special operations forces mission Fleet Battle Experiment Delta; counter anti-access, Fleet Battle Experiment Foxtrot; multinational rapid reaction forces, Allied Command Europe Mobile Force–Land; and combined arms maneuver warfare, Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I (DCX-I). During DCX-I, the blue force was digitized and networked to an unprecedented degree. Equally important, these forces were highly trained on this digital equipment and in many cases had developed new tactics, techniques and procedures to leverage their improved capability to operate in the information domain.</span> <span style="font-size: 16px;">The digitized and networked ground forces demonstrated significantly improved warfighting capabilities and were able to prevail over the opposing forces in a number of engagements</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">For example, during one phase of the exercise, the blue force was in a defensive posture with the opposing force moving to contact under the cover of darkness. A significant column of armor was detected by the joint surveillance target attack radar system and positively identified as hostile by a Hunter unmanned aerial vehicle, Col. Fred Stein, USA (Ret.), explains. An analysis of the real-time blue ground picture indicated that the attacking opposing force column was located approximately 10 miles from the brigade combat team’s defensive positions. The brigade commander, in consultation with the division commander, decided to engage the hostile force, and the fire mission was assigned to close air support. At this point, the engagement departed from the usual script, which had been characterized in the past by some as an exercise in futility, according to an internal correspondence from the Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Test Center. F-16s and A/OA-10s of the Arizona Air National Guard equipped with the situational awareness data link (SADL) performed a close-air-support mission. The networking of these aircraft enabled them to exchange real-time targeting information as well as to receive and display a forward trace of the blue ground picture. The result of this networking was more than an order of magnitude improvement in the ability of ground and air forces to share information. In addition to being equipped with SADL, the F-16s were equipped with Lightening II targeting pods and a mixed weapons load of GBU-12s and AGM-65D Mavericks. The Forward Air Controller–Airborne (FAC-A) determined that employing the F-16s as a coordinated pair would maximize combat power. In engaging the ground targets, the A/OA-10 FAC-A identified targets of interest and distributed sensor points of interest over SADL to facilitate sensor cueing by the F-16’s Lightening II targeting pod. Employing these tactics enabled each wave of two-ship pairs to engage tanks selectively and avoid dropping ordnance on less significant targets. The battle damage assessment of the first wave of F-16s was “two battalions rendered combat ineffective.” Follow-on flights of F-16s were equally lethal, according to the Air National Guard correspondence.</span> <span style="font-size: 16px;">The net result of this engagement was that this phase of the training exercise had to be recocked to enable ground forces to accomplish their training objectives for hasty defense and counterattack successfully, </span>Col. Stein says. This transformation of close air support at night from an exercise in futility to devastatingly effective combat highlights the efficacy of network-centric warfare. The impact of digitization and networking on the combined arms fight, specifically the impact of digital close air support, is described in an Army evaluation of DCX-I. “The National Training Center is a playing field that often humbles the visiting team,” it reports. “However, during the U.S. Army’s Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I, the visiting team, in the form of the U.S. Army’s 4th Infantry Division, supported by elements of the U.S. Air Force, including elements of the Arizona Air National Guard, were able to leverage the power of an order of magnitude increase in information sharing to turn the tables on the opposing forces on at least two occasions. Of particular significance was a devastating defeat of opposing forces at night by F-16 and A/OA-10 aircraft performing the close-air-support mission.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Worldwide, militaries are crafting their individual responses to the challenges and opportunities of the information age. They are taking actions that demonstrate an increased understanding of the sources of information age warfighting advantage</span>. A new vocabulary has developed that reflects the subtle variations in underlying strategies and core missions of militaries worldwide. To varying degrees, these actions also are reflected in emerging concepts and doctrine, focused investments in key enablers and well-crafted programs of experimentation. Besides network-centric warfare, currently used by the armed forces of the United States, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, other coined terms include Australia’s network-enabled warfare, the United Kingdom’s network-enabled capability, the Swedish armed forces’ network-based defense and the armed forces of the Republic of Singapore’s knowledge-based command and control. Each of these terms reflects its respective military’s ongoing response to the information age. Clearly, militaries worldwide are continuing to take a close look at network-centric warfare and related concepts for information age warfare. Evidently they like what they see.
Net-Centric Warfare is essential to prevent nuclear war, deter aggression, make heg sustainable and prevents nuclear terrorism – low cost, quicker fighting force will be necessary in dominating the military sphere
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Arquilla 10</span> (John Arquilla, professor of defense analysis at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, MARCH/APRIL 2010, “The New Rules of War”, [[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/22/the_new_rules_of_war]])

In another sign of the gathering swarm, the August 2008 Russian incursion into Georgia, rather than being a blast from the Cold War past, heralded the possibility that more traditional armies can master the art of omnidirectional attack. In this instance, Russian regular forces were augmented by ethnic militias fighting all over the area of operations — <span style="font-size: 16px;">and there was swarming in cyberspace at the same time. Indeed, the distributed denial of service attack, long a staple of cyberwarriors, is a model form of swarming</span>. And in this instance, <span style="font-size: 16px;">Georgian command and control was seriously disrupted by the hackers</span>. Simultaneous attack from several directions might be at the very cutting edge in conflict, but its lineage is quite old. Traditional tribal warfare, whether by nomadic horse archers or bush fighters, always featured some elements of swarms. The zenith of this kind of fighting probably came with the 13th-century Mongols, who had a name for this doctrine: “Crow Swarm.” When the attack was not carried out at close quarters by charging horsemen, but was instead conducted via arrows raining down on massed targets, the khans called it “Falling Stars.” With such tactics, the Mongols carved out the largest empire the world has ever seen, and kept it for a few centuries. But swarming was eclipsed by the rise of guns in the 15th century, which strongly favored massed volley fire. Industrial processes encouraged even more massing, and mechanization favored large flank maneuvers more than small swarms. Now again, in an age of global interdependence replete with advanced information technologies, even quite small teams of fighters can cause huge amounts of disruption. There is an old Mongol proverb: “With 40 men you can shake the world.” Look at what al Qaeda did with less than half that number on Sept. 11, 2001. This point was made by the great British strategist B.H. Liddell Hart in his biography of T.E. Lawrence, a master of the swarm in his own right. Liddell Hart, writing in 1935, predicted that at some point “the old concentration of force is likely to be replaced by an intangibly ubiquitous distribution of force — pressing everywhere, yet assailable nowhere.” Now, <span style="font-size: 16px;">swarming is making a comeback, but at a time when few organized militaries are willing or able to recognize its return. </span>For the implications of this development — most notably, that fighting units in very small numbers can do amazing things if used to swarm — are profoundly destabilizing. The most radical change is this: Standing armies can be sharply reduced in size, if properly reconfigured and trained to fight in this manner. Instead of continually “surging” large numbers of troops to trouble spots, the basic response of a swarm force would be to go swiftly, in small numbers, and strike the attackers at many points. In the future, it will take a swarm to defeat a swarm. Almost 20 years ago, I began a debate about networks that blossomed into an unlikely friendship with Vice Adm. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Art Cebrowski, the modern strategic thinker most likely to be as well remembered as Alfred Thayer Mahan, the great American apostle of sea power. He was the first in the Pentagon power structure to warm to my notions of developing fighting networks, embracing the idea of opening lots of lateral communications links between “sensors and shooters</span>.” We disagreed, however, about the potential of networks. Cebrowski thought that “<span style="font-size: 16px;">network-centric warfare” could be used to improve the performance of existing tools</span>— including aircraft carriers — for some time to come. I thought that networking implied a wholly new kind of navy, one made up of small, swift vessels, many of them remotely operated. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Cebrowski</span>, who passed away in late 2005, <span style="font-size: 16px;">clearly won this debate</span>, as <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. Navy remains heavily invested in being a “few-large” force — if one that is increasingly networked</span>. In an implicit nod to David Ronfeldt’s and my ideas, the Navy even has a Netwar Command now. Swarming has also gained some adherents. The most notable has been Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, who famously used swarm tactics in the last great Pentagon war game, “Millennium Challenge 2002,” to sink several aircraft carriers at the outset of the imagined conflict. But rather than accept that something quite radical was going on, the referees were instructed to “refloat” the carriers, and the costly game — its price tag ran in the few hundred millions — continued. Van Riper walked out. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Today, some in the U.S. military still pursue the idea of swarming, mostly in hopes of employing large numbers of small unmanned aerial vehicles in combat</span>. But military habits of mind and institutional interests continue to reflect a greater audience for surges than swarms. What //<span style="font-size: 16px;">if senior military leaders wake up and decide to take networks and swarming absolutely seriously</span>//? If they ever do, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">it is likely that the scourges of terrorism and aggression will become less a part of the world system</span>//. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Such a military would be smaller but quicker to respond, less costly but more lethal. The world system would become far less prone to many of the kinds of violence that have plagued it</span>. Networking and swarming are the organizational and doctrinal keys, respectively, to the strategic puzzle that has been waiting to be solved in our time. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A networked U.S. military that knows how to swarm would have much smaller active manpower</span> — easily two-thirds less than the more than 2 million serving today — but would be organized in hundreds more little units of mixed forces. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The model for military intervention would be the 200 Special Forces “horse soldiers</span>” who beat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan late in 2001. Such teams would deploy quickly and lethally, with ample reserves for relieving “first waves” and dealing with other crises. <span style="font-size: 16px;">At sea, instead of concentrating firepower in a handful of large, increasingly vulnerable supercarriers, the U.S. Navy would distribute its capabilities across many hundreds of small craft armed with very smart weapons.</span> Given their stealth and multiple uses, submarines would stay while carriers would go. And in the air, the “wings” would reduce in size but increase in overall number, with mere handfuls of aircraft in each. Needless to say, networking means that these small pieces would still be able to join together to swarm enemies, large or small. Is such a shift feasible? Absolutely. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Big reductions in the U.S. military are nothing new. The massive demobilization after World War II aside, active forces were reduced 40 percent in the few years after the Vietnam War and by another third right after the end of the Cold War</span>. But the key is not so much in cutting as it is in redesigning and rethinking. But what happens if the status quo prevails and the potential of this new round of changes in strategic affairs is ignored or misinterpreted? Failure awaits, at ruinous cost. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">The most likely form catastrophe </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">could take is that terrorist networks would stay on their feet long enough to acquire nuclear weapons</span>//. Even a handful of warheads in Osama bin Laden’s hands would give him great coercive power, as a network cannot be targeted for retaliation the same way a country can. Deterrence will lie in tatters. If there is ever to be a nuclear Napoleon, he will come from a terrorist network. Within the U.S. military, the danger is that senior commanders will fall back on a fatalism driven by their belief that both congressional and industrial leaders will thwart any effort at radical change. I have heard this objection countless times since the early 1990s, repeated mantra-like, all the way up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thus the mighty U.S. war machine is like a Gulliver trussed up by Lilliputian politicians and businessmen. The irony, however, is that <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. military has never been in a better position to gain acceptance for truly transformational change. Neither party in Congress can afford to be portrayed as standing in the way of strategic progress, and so, whatever the Pentagon asks for, it gets.</span> As for <span style="font-size: 16px;">defense contractors</span>, far from driving the agenda, they <span style="font-size: 16px;">are much too willing to give their military customers exactly what they demand</span> (rather than, perhaps, something better). <span style="font-size: 16px;">If the U.S. armed forces call for smaller, smarter weapons and systems to support swarming, they will get them. </span>Beyond the United States, <span style="font-size: 16px;">other countries' security forces are beginning to think along the lines of "many and small," are crafting better ways to "find," and are learning to swarm. Chinese naval thought today is clearly moving in this direction. Russian ground forces are, too</span>. Needless to say, <span style="font-size: 16px;">terrorist networks are still in the lead,</span> and not just al Qaeda. Hezbollah gave quite a demonstration of all three of the new rules of war in its summer 2006 conflict with Israel, a virtual laboratory test of nation versus network -- in which the network more than held its own. For the U.S. military, <span style="font-size: 16px;">failing a great leap forward in self-awareness of the need for radical change, a downward budgetary nudge is probably the best approach</span> -- despite President Barack Obama's unwillingness to extend his fiscal austerity program to security-related expenditures. This could take the form of a freeze on defense spending levels, to be followed by several years of, say, 10 percent annual reductions. To focus the redesign effort, a moratorium would be declared on all legacy-like systems (think aircraft carriers, other big ships, advanced fighters, tanks, etc.) while they are subjected to searching review. It should not be assumed that the huge sums invested in national defense have been wisely spent. <span style="font-size: 16px;">To most Americans who think that being strong on defense means devoting more resources and building bigger systems, this suggestion to cut spending will sound outrageous</span>. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">being smarter about defense might lower costs even as effectiveness improves. This pattern has held throughout the transformations of the last few decades, whether in farming or in industry. Why should the military be exempt? </span>There's real urgency to this debate. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Not only has history not ended with the Cold War and the advent of commerce-driven globalization, but conflict and violence have persisted -- even grown -- into a new postmodern scourge. </span>Indeed, it is ironic that, in an era in which the attraction to persuasive "soft power" has grown dramatically, <span style="font-size: 16px;">coercive "hard power" continues to dominate in world affairs. This is no surprise in the case of rogue nations hellbent on developing nuclear arsenals to ensure their security, nor when it comes to terrorist networks that think their essential nature is revealed in and sustained by violent acts.</span> But <span style="font-size: 16px;">this primary reliance on coercive capabilities is also on display across a range of countries great and small, most notably the United States, whose defense policy has over the past decade largely become its foreign policy. From the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to simmering crises with North Korea and Iran, and on to longer-range strategic concerns about East Asian and Central European security, the United States today is heavily invested in hard-power solutions. And it will continue to be. But if the radical adjustments in strategy, organization, and doctrine implied by the new rules of war are ignored, Americans will go on spending more and getting less when it comes to national defense</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">.</span>**</span>**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Networks will persist until they have the capability to land nuclear blows</span>**<span style="font-size: 16px;">.Other countries will leapfrog ahead of the United States militarily, and concepts like "deterrence" and "containment" of aggression will blow away like leaves in the wind. </span>So it has always been. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Every era of technological change has resulted in profound shifts in military and strategic affairs</span>. History tells us that <span style="font-size: 16px;">these developments were inevitable, but soldiers and statesmen were almost always too late in embracing them -- and tragedies upon tragedies ensued. There is still time to be counted among the exceptions</span>, like the Byzantines who, after the fall of Rome, radically redesigned their military and preserved their empire for another thousand years. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The U.S. goal should be to join the ranks of those who, in their eras, caught glimpses of the future and acted in time to shape it, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">saving the world from darkness</span>**</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">There is a reason that</span> regimes like <span style="font-size: 16px;">Iran and North Korea</span> go to the time and expense, and assume the risks of <span style="font-size: 16px;">developing nuclear weapons</span> programs; nuclear capability empowers them to achieve their ends, and thereby <span style="font-size: 16px;">poses challenges to the </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">U</span>//nited //<span style="font-size: 16px;">S</span>//tates, for several reasons. First, there is a danger that <span style="font-size: 16px;">rogue regimes</span> with nuclear material <span style="font-size: 16px;">may assist terrorists in developing</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">w</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">eapons of mass destruction</span>//.[36] Even the possibility that such regimes may do so gives them leverage internationally. Second, these regimes have ambitions in their regions and around the world.[37] <span style="font-size: 16px;">Some of their leaders are </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">fanatical enough to actually consider a first strike using nuclear weapons</span>//; for example, <span style="font-size: 16px;">high-ranking officials of</span> the <span style="font-size: 16px;">Iran</span>ian government <span style="font-size: 16px;">have openly discussed using a nuclear weapon against Israel</span>.[38] Whether a first strike occurs or not, the possession of nuclear capability frees aggressive regimes to pursue their other goals violently with less fear of retaliation. For example, <span style="font-size: 16px;">North Korea’s nuclear capability means that it could </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">attack South</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">Korea</span>// conventionally with a measure of impunity; even if the attack failed, the United States and its allies would be less likely to remove the North Korean regime in retaliation. In other words, <span style="font-size: 16px;">nuclear capability lessens the penalties</span> which could be exacted on North Korea if it engages in aggression, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">which makes the aggression more likely</span>//. The same logic applies to Iran, which is why the other nations in the Middle East are so concerned about Iran’s nuclear program. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A nuclear attack by Iran is possible</span>, but the real danger of <span style="font-size: 16px;">Iranian nuclear capability</span> is that it <span style="font-size: 16px;">would make </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">conventional aggression in the region more likely</span>//.[39] Finally, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the more nations that get nuclear weapons, </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">the</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">greater the pressure on other nations to acquire them</span>// as a deterrent, <span style="font-size: 16px;">and this is particularly true when a government</span> acquiring the capability <span style="font-size: 16px;">is seen as </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">unstable </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">oraggressive</span>//. North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons has tended, for obvious reasons, to make the South Koreans and Japanese uncomfortable about having no deterrent themselves. The possibility of uncontrolled proliferation—what experts call <span style="font-size: 16px;">a “nuclear cascade</span>”[40]—<span style="font-size: 16px;">is </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">tremendously dangerous</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">; it increases the possibility that terrorists can get nuclear material</span> from a national program, <span style="font-size: 16px;">and it raises the prospect of a </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">multilateral nuclear confrontation</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;"> between nations</span>.[41] Many of <span style="font-size: 16px;">the smaller nuclear nations do not have</span> well-established <span style="font-size: 16px;">first strike doctrine</span> or launch protocols; <span style="font-size: 16px;">the chance of a nuclear exchange, accidental or intentional, increases </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">geometrically</span>// //<span style="font-size: 16px;">when a confrontation is multilateral. The antidote to proliferation is American leadership and power. The reality and perception of American strength not only deters aggressive regimes from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; it reassures other countries that they can exist safely under the umbrella of American power without having to develop their own deterrent capability</span>//.[42]



Terrorism risks Extinction

In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question “Is Nuclear War Inevitable??” In Section , Moore points out what most <span style="font-size: 16px;">terrorists</span>obviously already <span style="font-size: 16px;">know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange</span>. As Moore points out, <span style="font-size: 16px;">all</span> that militant <span style="font-size: 16px;">terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb</span> and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Because of the Russian “dead hand” system, “where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,” it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States</span>” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Israeli leaders</span> and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it <span style="font-size: 16px;">would retaliate with the suicidal “Samson option</span>” against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even “anti-Semitic” European cities In that case, of course, <span style="font-size: 16px;">Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of </span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">nuclear warheads</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">,</span> many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">would rain </span>upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radi<span style="font-size: 16px;">oactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations </span>in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And <span style="font-size: 16px;">what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Any accident, mistaken communication, false signal or “lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason could, in a matter of a few minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons</span>, and once a weapon is used, then the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is actually less probable since <span style="font-size: 16px;">each country would act under the “use them or lose them” strategy and psychology</span>; restraint by one power would be interpreted as a weakness by the other, which could be exploited as a window of opportunity to “win” the war. In other words, <span style="font-size: 16px;">once Pandora's Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them</span>. Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, “everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self-determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors” In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and once even just one is used, it is very likely that many, if not all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of much of human civilization while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter. In “Scenarios,” Moore summarizes the various ways a nuclear war could begin: <span style="font-size: 16px;">Such a war could start through a reaction to terrorist attacks, or through the need to protect against overwhelming military opposition</span>, or through the use of small battle field tactical nuclear weapons meant to destroy hardened targets. It might quickly move on to the use of strategic nuclear weapons delivered by short-range or inter-continental missiles or long-range bombers. These could deliver high altitude bursts whose electromagnetic pulse knocks out electrical circuits for hundreds of square miles. Or they could deliver nuclear bombs to destroy nuclear and/or non-nuclear military facilities, nuclear power plants, important industrial sites and cities. Or it could skip all those steps and start through the accidental or reckless use of strategic weapons

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The question, then, is not whether the United States should intervene everywhere or nowhere. The decision Americans need to make is whether the United States should generally lean forward, or whether it should adopt a posture of relative passivity. A strong America capable of projecting force quickly and with devastating effect to important regions of the world would make it less likely that challengers to regional stability will attempt to alter the status quo in their favor. It might even deter them from undertaking expensive efforts to arm themselves for such a challenge. An America whose willingness to project force is in doubt, on the other hand, can only encourage such challenges. In Europe, in Asia and in the Middle East, the message we should be sending to potential foes is: "Don't even think about it." That kind of deterrence offers the best recipe for lasting peace, and it is much cheaper than fighting the wars that would follow should we fail to create such a deterrent</span>.

Because platforms such a Worldview-1 and GeoEye-1 are commer- cial in nature, and not subject to expensive add-ons and countermeasures which would enhance their survivability, these <span style="font-size: 16px;">commercial satellites are highly vulnerable to potential PRC interference and destruction</span>. Indeed, <span style="font-size: 16px;">such satellites would present the PRC with an attractive target set in any future cross-strait crisis because the disabling of commercial satellites would serve a valuable military purpose without greatly escalating a crisis</span>. Theoretically the adversary would be blinded (at least partially) and yet would have no legal grounds to declare war. The <span style="font-size: 16px;">PRC employed just such a strategy in the 1995-96 Cross-Strait Missile Crisis</span>, using radar-jamming to blind a commercial SAR imagery satellite that was providing Taiwan with intelligence on PLA exercises and the PLA military buildup opposite Taiwan.234 //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Given</span>// this, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">government’s</span>// partial (and //<span style="font-size: 16px;">growing) reliance upon commercial satellites for</span>//imagery and //<span style="font-size: 16px;">communications certainly does represent an Achilles’ heellikely to be exploited by the PRC</span>//in any future conflict. How far such exploitation might go, and what affects it might have are subjects for the next chapter. In conclusion, this chapter has sought to describe the expanding U.S. reliance upon satellites, noting their economic value while primarily focusing on their military utility, to illustrate some of the ways space platforms are vital to the U.S. military’s revolution in military affairs. The Chinese ASAT test shows that the <span style="font-size: 16px;">U.S. military’s </span>unparalleled <span style="font-size: 16px;">space infrastructure</span>, while serving as an essential force-multiplier that gives the U.S. a tremendous edge in modern warfare, also <span style="font-size: 16px;">represents a weakness in the sense that it is particularly vulnerable to asymmetric interference and attack. This state of affairs is exacerbated as the U.S. military increasingly turns to commercial satellite providers</span> to offset budget overruns and scheduling delays in government-funded programs. Interestingly, the semi-classified military space budget did not drastically increase in the wake of the Chinese direct-assent ASAT test of last year despite the PRC action representing a significant, and troubling, alteration of both the PRC’s capabilities and intentions. We now turn to the next chapter to discuss the level of significance the Chinese development of counter-space weapons could have for U.S.-Sino relations in the coming years.



Cyber war reverses the nuclear taboo – new forms of war ensure accidental launch

The end of Cold War has led some to assume that <span style="font-size: 16px;">nuclear weapons</span>and nuclear deterrence <span style="font-size: 16px;">are passe.</span> Along with this, is a related <span style="font-size: 16px;">assumption that a revolution in high technology, conventional weaponry will accelerate the rate of nuclear political and military obsolescence. On the other hand, all concede that the "revolution in military affairs" is driven mostly by new technologies in information, communications, and electronics</span>. [1] New information and <span style="font-size: 16px;">communication technologies may enable new forms of war making, including information warfare, that are dysfunctional for deterrence stability with, or without, nuclear weapons. It is possible that the remnants of pax atomica will combine with attacks using the new strategies of information to produce an outcome no one favors: accidental or inadvertent nuclear war or escalation.</span> In order to proceed, we need a working definition of information warfare. A large literature offers candidate views on the concept of information warfare. [2] <span style="font-size: 16px;">For present purposes, information warfare can be defined as activities by one state or nonstate actor against another that attempt to disrupt, deceive, or destroy one or more of the following attributes of military or military related information</span>: (1) the physical aspects of information transfer or communication, such as landlines, <span style="font-size: 16px;">radio receivers, satellites</span>, commanders, and command posts, not to exclude the flow of electrons back and forth between senders and receivers; (2) <span style="font-size: 16px;">the communications contents, consisting of asserted facts, ideas, proposals, and other messages</span>; (3) the network of channels by which sender are receiver are connected and organizational behaviors influenced; (4) the security protocols that authenticate a message sender and/or enable senders and receivers to pass information back and forth without giving it away to the enemy; and, (5) <span style="font-size: 16px;">perseons in the security decision-making process, including their role perceptions and their images of the adversary that might be influenced by infowar.</span>



PLA is Building up it’s forces to target US ISR vulnerabilities – gives China upper hand in conflict
Alexander <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Neill</span>, head of the Asia Security Programme at the Royal United Services Institute, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">11</span> [“Viewpoint: A new Sino-US high-tech arms race?”, BBC News, Jan 11, [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-asia-pacific-12154991]]]
Beneath the veneer of official smiles and neatly choreographed handshakes at the defence summit in Beijing, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the Sino-US relationship remains fraught with uncertainty</span>. A year after military relations were frozen by Beijing in the wake of a $6.4bn (£4.1bn) arms package to Taiwan, the US request for a resumption of a substantial strategic dialogue has been given a lukewarm reception in Beijing. The People's Liberation Army's (PLA) appetite for engagement with the US has waned considerably over the last year. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Cementing its defence arrangement with Taiwan, and holding large-scale naval war games in China's back yard in recent months, the US has buttressed its alliances with its East Asian allies. These actions have fuelled resentment in China and fears of US military encirclement. US irritation is based on a recent spate of harassment by the PLA Navy and Chinese fishing vessels against the US Navy and its allies in the West Pacific</span>. The US is also frustrated with China's intransigence towards meaningful strategic dialogue on international security concerns, particularly while tension on the Korean peninsula remains high and nuclear proliferation by North Korea continues unchecked. But the Pentagon's visceral concern is its failure to detect the break-neck speed of Chinese military technological advances and its ability to curb an arms race in East Asia. 'Pressure point warfare' Despite recent headlines reporting the appearance of a Chinese stealth fighter prototype, of more concern to US military planners is the enabling technology that will produce the bite to China's military bark. This angst is focused on China's decade-long programme of military "informationisation" designed to leap-frog over US capabilities in the Pacific region. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The PLA is rapidly developing asymmetric warfare techniques against US command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance infrastructure, known as "C4ISR" in military parlance. </span>For China, with its inferior conventional military capabilities, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the key to gaining the upper hand in a conflict with the US is to gain dominance of the space theatre and to damage its digital nerve system</span>. China views space as a corner-stone of its future prosperity: a mandate from heaven for China's growth and military strength. For this reason, China is working hard to counter the Pentagon's monopoly in space and to build its own space-based deterrent. The <span style="font-size: 16px;">PLA's</span> doctrine of "pressure point warfare", a multi-layered approach using space, cyberspace and information operations alongside conventional capabilities is designed to cripple an adversary in one swift strike. This fast paced and high-tech military modernisation has led to the emergence of weapons systems and technology, which in certain theatres has <span style="font-size: 16px;">closed the military capability gap with the US considerably. These include directed energy, jamming and cyber attack technologies, designed to paralyse the US military machine</span>. The PLA has recently developed and successfully tested advanced anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons systems, demonstrating it can destroy or manoeuvre close to enemy satellites in space. ASAT weapons are part of a new genre of "assassin's mace" or surprise weapons aimed at the Pentagon's Achilles Heel in space and cyberspace. All of these capabilities require state of the art signals processing and communications systems, technology which China has been developing indigenously to create its own command and control architecture. Carrier fears <span style="font-size: 16px;">One of the most pressing concerns for the United States navy is the prospect of US aircraft carriers and other vessels being denied access to theatres of operation in the event that the US were dragged into a conflict over Taiwan or in support of its other Pacific allies.</span> Coined by Pentagon planners as China's "A2/AD" (Anti Access/Area Denial) strategy, the PLA would attempt to prevent US aircraft carriers from deploying to theatre, targeted by Chinese torpedoes, Cruise Missiles and Anti Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBMs). <span style="font-size: 16px;">PLA tacticians know that a successful strike against a moving US aircraft carrier requires advanced space-based targeting assets and an ability to penetrate the US ballistic missile defence umbrella</span>.



US-China relations collapse makes conflict inevitable – IR and empirics prove
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Zhang 11</span> (Baohui, Ph.D. in political science from the University of Texas in Austin , “The Security Dilemma in the U.S.-China Military Space Relationship, : Asian Survey, Vol. 51, No. 2 (March/April 2011), pp. 311-332”, April 2011, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/AS.2011.51.2.311]]</span>)
<span style="font-size: 16px;">China’s military space program and its strategies for space warfare have caused rising concerns in the United States.In fact, China’s military intentions in outer space have emerged as one of the central security issues between the two countries.</span>In November 2009, after the commander of the Chinese Air Force called the militarization of space “a historical inevitability,” General Kevin Chilton, head of the U.S. Strategic Command, urged China to explain the objectives of its rapidly advancing military space program.1 Indeed, in the wake of China’s January 2007 anti-satellite (ASAT) test, many U.S. experts have attempted to identify China’s motives. One driver of China’s military space program is its perception of a forthcoming revolution in military affairs. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) sees space as a new and critical dimension of future warfare. The comment by the commander of the Chinese Air Force captures this perception of the PLA.2 In addition,<span style="font-size: 16px;">China’s military space program is seen as part of a broad asymmetric strategy designed to offset conventional U.S. military advantages.</span> For example, as observed by Ashley J. Tellis in 2007,<span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 14.6667px;"> “</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">China’s pursuit of counterspace capabilities </span>is not driven fundamentally by a desire to protest American space policies, and those of the George W. Bush administration in particular, but is<span style="font-size: 16px;">part of a considered strategy designed to counter the overall military capabilities of the United States.</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 14.6667px;">”</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 7.33333px;">3 </span>Richard J. Adams and Martin E. France, U.S. Air Force officers, contend that “Chinese interests in space weapons do not hinge on winning a potential U.S.-Chinese ASAT battle or participating in a space arms race.” Instead, they argue<span style="font-size: 16px;">, China’s military space program is driven by a desire to “counter the space-enabled advantage of U.S. conventional forces.”</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 7.33333px;">4 </span>This perspective implies that<span style="font-size: 16px;">given the</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 14.6667px;"> predicted </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">U.S. superiority in conventional warfare, China feels compelled to continue its offensive military space program.</span>Inevitably, this perspective sees China as the main instigator of a possible space arms race, whether implicitly or explicitly. China’s interpretation of the revolution in military affairs and its quest for asymmetric warfare capabilities are important for understanding the 2007 ASAT test. This article suggests that the Chinese military space program is also influenced by the security dilemma in international relations.<span style="font-size: 16px;">Due to the anarchic nature of the world order, “the search for security on the part of state A leads to insecurity for state B which therefore takes steps to increase its security leading in its turn to increased insecurity for state A and so on.”5 The military space relationship between China and the U.S. clearly embodies the tragedy of a security dilemma</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 14.6667px;">. </span>In many ways, the <span style="font-size: 16px;">current Chinese thinking on space warfare reflects China’s response to the perceived U.S. threat to its national securit</span>y. This response, in turn, has triggered American suspicion about China’s military intentions in outer space. Thus<span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 14.6667px;">, </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">the security dilemma in the U.S.-China space relationship has inevitably led to measures and countermeasures</span><span style="font-family: AGaramondPro-Regular,serif; font-size: 14.6667px;">.</span>

Satellite Vulnerability leads china to act offensively in space – triggers war over Taiwan
Chung-chian <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Teng</span> is Dean of the College of International Affairs at National Chengchi University <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Kuo-Hsiung <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Lee</span> is the director of the Natural Products Research Laboratories at UNC Chapel Hill <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">08</span> [“China's Militarization of Space: Motivations and Implications for U.S-Chinese Relations”, NCCU, Chapter 5: U.S. Response, Toward a “Cold War” in Space, pdf]
During the recent Iraq war, 68% of munitions were satellite guided, a massive increase from the merely 10% of satellite guided munitions used in the 1991 Iraq War.199 One senior Air Force officer said that thanks to satellite technology the U.S. no longer fights in the fog of war, but in a “huge cloud of electrons.”200 However, <span style="font-size: 16px;">because four-fifths of America’s military data is transmitted through unhardened commercial satellites, and a single Global Hawk unmanned surveillance drone flying over the middle east can consume several times more bandwidth than was used in the whole of the 1991 war against Iraq, Air Force officers commonly describe space as being America’s “Achilles Heel</span>.”201 Referring to China’s ASAT test, General Hamel of the Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center said “//<span style="font-size: 16px;">if they take </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">our asymmetric advantage in space, we go from an information age war machine to an industrial age war machine…shifting the balance, the edge will go to the adversary</span>//.” Many specialists also argue that aside from the U.S. military dependency on orbital space, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. economy, and in turn, much of the world economy, is also rapidly becoming dependent on space-based system</span>s. They posit that, in effect, the U.S. is now a “space faring” nation whose very way of life is tied to the myriad capabilities provided by the orbital space medium.203 War games conducted as part of U.S. national security protocols, such as the Army-After-Next, Navy Global and Air Force Global Engagement series, Space Game 2 and Schriever 1 & 2, as well as the privately conducted “DEADSATS” war games, conducted from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, confirm this view. According to some space experts who were intimately involved with the war games, the exercises exposed “a critical national Achilles heel that politicians, economists and corporate CEOs have largely ignored…<span style="font-size: 16px;">losses in space can quickly affect the economic, social, and national security fabric not only of the united States, but of the entire world</span>.”204 These experts further speculate that “<span style="font-size: 16px;">large military powers,” such as the United States, could “be held hostage by the unknowns inherent in a new kind of war.</span>”205 <span style="font-size: 16px;">These concerns are directly linked with China’s ASAT threat and their potential applicability in any future U.S.-Sino conflict. Clearly any possible U.S. military contingency in the Taiwan Straits would require secure satellites as the U.S. becomes ever more reliant upon its space systems</span>. Moreover, <span style="font-size: 16px;">reconnaissance satellites are thought to limit the risk inherent in the build-up of forces that both the PRC and the U.S. could be expected to deploy to the region in the event of a crisis</span>.206 However, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">if the U.S. was blinded as the result of a preemptive Chinese ASAT attack, the conflict could quickly escalate to a dangerous level</span>//. According to two experts on the subject, “if there is a great- power war in the twenty-first century, our crystal ball says that it will be between the United States and China over Taiwan, with a very serious potential for a horrible escalatory process.”207 This underscores the gravity of the topic as well as the negative impact the Chinese shift towards fielding counter-space weapons could have.



Strong and diverse ISR and Satellite capabilities deter short term China Attack
Chung-chian <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Teng</span> is Dean of the College of International Affairs at National Chengchi University <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Kuo-Hsiung <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Lee</span> is the director of the Natural Products Research Laboratories at UNC Chapel Hill <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">08</span> [“China's Militarization of Space: Motivations and Implications for U.S-Chinese Relations”, NCCU, Chapter Six: Space Militarization: Implications for U.S.-Chinese Relations, pdf]
In many ways <span style="font-size: 16px;">China’s counter-space platforms</span>, such as its already operational directed-energy, ground-based lasers and its direct-ascent, solid-fueled (and therefore rapidly deployable) ASAT missiles that can be launched from any of China’s hundreds of road-mobile, SRBM and MRMB launchers, already <span style="font-size: 16px;">represent a real threat to U.S. forces</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This threat will only grow and ramify with time, perhaps geometrically so, as the PRC continues to grow its young stock of operational</span> Dong Feng-31 (DF-31) road-mobile <span style="font-size: 16px;">ICBMs</span>, which while generally thought to be tipped with 400 kiloton nuclear <span style="font-size: 16px;">warheads</span>,235 <span style="font-size: 16px;">could be modified to attack U.S. national security satellites in GEO</span> with KKVs or future co-orbital killer satellites, EMP weapons and high-powered microwave weapons, all of which are under development. In the interim, General Cartwright’s statement, mentioned previously, that the PRC would be able to destroy all the U.S. reconnaissance satellites in LEO by 2010 appears to be correct.236 According to Desmond Ball, it would require approximately 20 ASAT missiles of the type that destroyed FY-1C last year to destroy 6-7 LEO satellites, which is the number of current U.S. Crystal and Lacrosse space vehicles currently believed to be in orbit. Assuming they passed over or near the PRC, U.S. spy satellites would indeed be vulnerable to China’s ASAT weapons by 2010, as 20 operational, direct-ascent ASAT missiles would presumably be easy enough to field by that time given that the PRC is already mass-producing well over a hundred similar missile platforms a year. All one would need to modify would be the warhead and guidance package, both of which have been already been proven and have been operational as of January 11, 2007.237 The PLA can be expected to continue to develop its ASAT guidance package (which is reportedly radar based and therefore highly vulnerable to jamming) in order to overcome U.S. defense satellites’ built-in counter-measures, which are thought to be quite technologically impressive.238 Therefore the PRC already has an operational ASAT capability, and one that is likely to grow in sophistication and capability. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This will add to the U.S. imperative to counter and deter the Chinese counter-space weapons, and further fuel the U.S.-Sino cold war style build-up in space mentioned previously. In the near-term China is unlikely to be able to compete directly with the U.S., and therefore will continue its asymmetric efforts to exploit the U.S. vulnerability in space.</span> Looking more distantly, <span style="font-size: 16px;">however, one can forecast a situation where China is competing with the U.S. in space</span>(and <span style="font-size: 16px;">on terra firma</span>) as more of a peer-competitor. In such a situation, <span style="font-size: 16px;">whereby there is a relative balance of power and mutual reliance upon orbital space, one could foresee increased stability and something akin to the détente that characterized the later stages of the cold war and led to U.S.-Soviet cooperation in outer space</span>. However, as noted by a recent study, it will be a long time before the PRC can be considered a true peer competitor of the U.S. in space.239 //<span style="font-size: 16px;">In the interim</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">, there is a strong possibility that the relationship between the two powers will be unstable, withpotential global repercussions</span>//. China’s irresponsible actions in space only underscore that growing trend, and point to a disturbing strategic environment in the years ahead. That said, the likely U.S. response to any ASAT attack on an American government satellite, which would be viewed much in the same way that an attack on U.S. terrestrial forces would be (i.e. an act of war), probably rule it out barring a massive miscalculation on the part of the Chinese leadership or a Chinese decision to engage in a Pearl Harbor style sneak attack. The danger lies in the fact that as the PRC’s counter-space capabilities grow and become more subtle with the development of micro-satellites, nano-satellites and other less conspicuous ASAT platforms which could potentially interfere with U.S. satellites without going so far as destroying them, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S.-Sino relationship in space may become more unstable because the potential Chinese menu of options would be increasingly tempting</span>, offering as it would ever more possibilities at a time when the U.S. reliance upon satellites was ever greater. To <span style="font-size: 16px;">offset this scenario</span>, which would mix a dangerous brew of Chinese capabilities with U.S. vulnerabilities in a situation <span style="font-size: 16px;">that could escalate rapidly to general war, the U.S. can be expected to not only diversify and strengthen its orbital assets, but also to develop better air-breathing reconnaissance platforms</span>, such as smaller, stealthier Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV) with longer dwell times in order to have the ability to rapidly restore lost satellite coverage in a crisis. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This U.S. diversification and multiplication of reconnaissance assets would thereby both strengthen the durability of its C4ISR network and force the PRC to plan for more targets, thus making it a less tempting option and creating an environment for better deterrence</span>. Let us now conclude this chapter with a summation and a brief policy suggestion.

US-China War over Taiwan goes nuclear – most likely scenario for conflict
Richard C. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Bush</span>, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and director of its Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Michael E. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">O'Hanlon</span>, senior fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution, where he specializes in U.S. defense strategy, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">07</span> [“A war like no other: the truth about China's challenge to America”, p. 186, google books]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">If war resulted, escalation pressures would be enormous</span>. It would be the first significant war between nuclear weapons states in world history. And the nuclear arsenals of the two sides could, as unreasonable and illogical as it sounds, come into play. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Nuclear exchanges</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;"> could even result</span>//. At a time when <span style="font-size: 16px;">the threat of superpower nuclear war has become much less vivid in the public eye</span> due to the end of the Cold War, <span style="font-size: 16px;">a Taiwan crisis could—ironically enough—quickly create </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">the most serious nuclear risk </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">since the Cuban Missile Crisis</span>. The conclusion is not intended to be melodramatic. Even in the event of war, the risk of nuclear conflagration would be be much less than fifty-fifty, since both sides would surely recognize the dangers. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">crises have dynamics all their own</span>. What neither side would see as desirable could nonetheless occur as the fog of war impeded accurate and timely <span style="font-size: 16px;">information flows and clouded leaders’ judgments—and</span> as <span style="font-size: 16px;">the loss of lives raised the stakes to the point where neither Beijing nor Washington could easily back down</span>. In addition, the war plans of the two sides could create momentum of their own. Although details are classified (and always changing in any even), <span style="font-size: 16px;">in the past these war plans apparently have called for hastier escalation than political leaders generally appreciate</span>. This may have changed of late, and certainly recent American commanders in the region have been sensitive to the need to build positive relationships with China and to avoid assuming that conflict would quickly escalate. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">predisposition to restraint may not easily survive direct combat with a major military power; arguments in favor of rapid escalation will be powerful</span>, whether or not the carry the day. Leaders in Taiwan, China, and the United States need to think these issues through thoroughly in advance—for the sake of their war plans, their diplomacy, and their politics. They must figure out how to avoid escalation in any serious crisis or war that beings—for once the three parties get to that point, <span style="font-size: 16px;">avoiding all-out U.S.-China war is more important than other realistic concerns</span>. Indeed, it is so paramount in importance that Taipei, Beijing, and Washington must avoid the temptation to manufacture crises or play politics with the independence of sovereignty issues.

TSAT is specifically key to Solve bandwidth Shortages– Current Satellite communications don’t meet ISR needs

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Just as the military and intelligence communities have transformed the way they operate, TSAT will transform the way they communicate</span>. As shown in figure E-12, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">TSAT will provide a dramatic increase in capacity and capability over </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">existing</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and interim </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">satellite</span>////<span style="font-size: 12pt;">communications</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> resources</span>. Depending on circumstances, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">military forces often operate from unimproved and disadvantaged locations world-wide, are highly mobile, and depend heavily on reach-back for near-real time intelligence, imagery, and logistical information as well as inter-unit cooperation and support. </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The greatly expanded use of UAVs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and for direct target engagement has placed extraordinary demands on the current SATCOM system. TSAT will mitigate those demands and further operational flexibility</span>//. The TSAT system is essential to enhancing military and intelligence operations. //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Without TSAT</span>////<span style="font-size: 12pt;">, mobile land forces and Navy ships will lack sufficient assured ISR communications</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> capacity, and the Military and IC will be unable to move and fully benefit from the large and growing quantity of data generated by new airborne and space ISR systems</span>. TSAT exemplifies the promise of the TCA’s enhanced capabilities and is a critical element of the transformation in military and intelligence operations.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some officials have expressed concern that difficulties in mastering the technological intricacies of the signal processor/router may prevent its full development in time for the first scheduled T-Sat</span>launch.

He notes that the <span style="font-size: 12pt;">contractors have considerable experience with similar technology in so-called heritage satellites</span>. “I’m not saying that any of this is easy to do,” Meink asserts. “We still have a lot of work to do, but <span style="font-size: 12pt;">we’re meeting our objectives</span>. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">We’re either on or ahead of schedule on the technologies.

Meink says the T-Sat program was carefully configured from the beginning to avoid the problems of hasty and haphazard structuring</span> that have plagued some other space programs in recent years. “<span style="font-size: 12pt;">We’ve taken more time than normal in the early part of the program to make sure that we’ve gotten this right, to ensure that the technology has matured to a higher level than usual in going into development</span>,” he says. He also notes that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the program will involve the independent, noncontractor testing of all advanced technology elements.</span>

Interoperability makes their generic NCW and GIG turns irrelevant – new guidance programs ensure plan solves
Clay <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wilson</span>, Specialist in Technology and National Security Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">07</span> [“Network Centric Operations: Background and Oversight Issues for Congress”, CRS report for Congress, march 15, pdf, mcG]
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">NCO is highly dependent on the interoperability of communications equipment, data, and software to enable networking of people, sensors, and manned and unmanned platforms</span>. Parts of NCO technology rely on lineof-sight radio transmission for microwave or infrared signals, or laser beams. Other parts of the technology aggregate information for transmission through larger network trunks for global distribution via fiber optic cables, microwave towers, or both lowaltitude and high-altitude satellites. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The designs for this technology must enable rapid communications between individuals in all services, and rapid sharing of data and information between mobile platforms and sensors used by all military services</span>.60 The <span style="font-size: 12pt;">architectures must also have the ability to dynamically self-heal and re-form the network when one or more communications nodes are interrupted. DOD officials have noted that the new military Global Information Grid (GIG) must be also designed to interoperate securely with the networks of other organizations outside of DOD</span>, including state and local governments, multinational military commands, and the commercial and research communities.61<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some observers question whether the U.S. military can achieve true network and systems interoperability among all services. DOD reportedly intends to integrate the architectures of network systems used by all branches of the military to create a network centric capability linked to the GIG</span>(seesectionbelow). Tohelpaccomplish this integration, the <span style="font-size: 12pt;">DOD Joint Staff has created a new Force Capability Board (FCB) to monitor NCO programs for mismatches in funding, or mismatches in capability</span>. When an issue is detected, the FCB reports to the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, which then provides guidance during budget deliberations at the Pentagon.62

TSAT is the only system that works – AEHF and WGS Fail

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">With TSAT, everything changes. While WGS and AEHF are evolutionary gains in capability and capacity, TSAT is truly transformation. Certainly, TSAT is more of the same in some respects; </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">TSAT will offer a tenfold increase in capacity over AEHF</span>//. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">However, when you consider IP routing in space, the incredible gains as the result of laser communications, the efficiency delivered through dynamic bandwidth allocation (you get the bandwidth you need, when you need it) and T1 (1.544 Mbs) date rates for protected comm-on-the-move users with small diameter antennas, </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">TSAT will change the way we fight, coordinate, collaborate, maneuve</span>////<span style="font-size: 12pt;">r</span>//—I could go on and on. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">TSAT will move more data, more protected data, to more users, while on the move.

As planned, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the T-Sat operational constellation will consist of five highly advanced communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit. A sixth T-Sat will be deployed as an inactive spare in the event of attrition</span>. Each <span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat will provide</span> both laser communications (<span style="font-size: 12pt;">lasercom) and</span> advanced <span style="font-size: 12pt;">radio frequency</span>(RF) communications, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">with crosslinks to other space platforms and downlinks to airborne, land-based, and sea-based platforms.</span> Each <span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat will also embody the so-called next-generation signal processor/router (NGPR) for ultra-high-speed prioritization</span> and distribution of communications. These innovative features will enable the TSat system to disseminate a wealth of information through and from space in rapid-fire fashion, at exceedingly high data rates, to military and national intelligence users, in fixed positions or on the move, anywhere in the world. T<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sats are designed to withstand jamming and other disruptive or destructive antisatellite countermeasures</span>. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are competing for the contract to produce the T-Sats in an acquisition program that will cost an estimated $16 billion. In January 2004, the Air Force awarded each company a contract of about $500 million to carry out the design and risk-reduction phase of T-Sat development. The service will select the winner in late FY06. First launch of a <span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat is planned for</span>the <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2013</span>-2015 time frame. Full operational capability of the T-Sat constellation is scheduled for 2018.
TSAT meets requirements – Transformational COM study proves

The <span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat system is the heart of the Pentagon’s transformational communications architecture</span> <span style="font-size: 9.5pt;">(TCA), </span>devised by defense scientists in 2004 under the direction of Peter Teets, former undersecretary of the Air Force. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The TCA resulted from the transformational communications study (TCS) undertaken by the Defense Dept</span>. in 2002. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The architecture addresses, among other things, wideband space-to-space and space-tohigh-altitude airborne communications using a common standard for laser communication; communications and relay satellites; ground terminals; operational management systems; and communications interfaces. </span>The <span style="font-size: 9.5pt;">TCA </span>makes sure that new, transformational satcom systems will be able to connect with existing, or legacy, systems in space. The Air Force-managed T-Sat/<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;">T-MOS </span>system is being developed to do just that. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Meink explains that T-Sat will be “the means of removing communications constraints in terms of capacity, control, adaptability, responsiveness, and coverage</span>,” <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and of meeting global U.S. requirements for communications across the defense, intelligence, and civil communities</span>, including <span style="font-size: 9.5pt;">NASA</span>. “<span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat would be a key enabler of our forces whether or not they go to this idealized net-centric warfare,”</span> Meink says. “T-Sat would be critical to what our forces are capable of doing right now, not just to what they’ll be capable of doing in the future. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">We’re trying to do as much as we can with what we have right now.” The key to T-Sat’s transformational capability lies in its packet-routed, rather than circuit-switched, communications, </span>the program director notes. He explains that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">packet-routing will result in “dynamic, seamless, full-mesh connectivity—connecting anyone to everyone” using the GIG</span>, whereas circuit-switching is relatively static, and affords only point-to-point or multipoint connectivity

Commercial aerospace fails – oversight is key – Aerospace effective
Robert H. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Trice</span>, PhD Poli Sci, prof poli sci, member of the Council on Foreign Relations and past Chairman of the International Council of the Aerospace Industries Association, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">11</span> [“Modestly-Sized Aerospace & Defense Sector Is Major National Asset”, March 10, Essay, pdf]
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">One reason A&D companies are sometimes charged with being costly, cumbersome, risk averse and bureaucratic is that they mirror their primary customers</span>. And, inevitably, the <span style="font-size: 12pt;">periodic attempts to make the process more economical and “commercial-like” fail because this government marketplace is the antithesis of a commercial one</span>. Commercial businesses work in generally open markets, dealing directly with multiple customers empowered to make buying decisions through individual transactions, and with growth largely constrained by anti-trust laws. A<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&D companies are largely dealing with a single customer set comprised of multiple, competing political constituencies, with growth and size limits often set by industrial base considerations.</span> Commercial firms work to a price-based, closed book business model. The market determines what consumers will pay for a particular widget, irrespective of what it costs to make it. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">A&D companies work to a cost-based, open book business model</span>. Cost and price negotiations are governed by the Truth in Negotiation Act (TINA) and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) that lay out every element of contractor cost to be analyzed. To ensure A&D companies are fulfilling their DOD contractual obligations, in 2009 the Defense Contracting Auditing Agency (DCAA) employed 4,000 people with a budget of $433M, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) had 10,000 civilians with a budget of over $1B, and the Office of the Inspector General had 1,475 auditors and a budget of $288M. In addition, there are military service acquisition and program management offices for every program, the Office of the Secretary of Defense acquisition community and Congress’ auditing arm, the General Accountability Office (GAO). The Department of Defense has stated that it will further increase oversight by hiring 20,000 more acquisition professionals, at a time of flattening acquisition budgets. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">A&D companies have to staff their program management, finance, contracts and internal audit functions to service these legally mandated government requirements. Unless a commercial company really messes up</span> (Enron, AIG, BP, Lehman Brothers), <span style="font-size: 12pt;">it is likely to face limited government oversight. By the very nature of its work, an A&D company lives with significant oversight every day.</span> A commercial company faces very limited controls over most exports; defense exports, quite rightly, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">are by far the most highly regulated of any industrial sector</span>. Each step along the way to a foreign sale of U.S. defense equipment requires its own State Department export license, and each proposed sale over $50M is subject to Congressional review. As of 2010, there are literally tens of thousands of active licenses that govern how A&D companies approach the international marketplace. And finally, a commercial company’s product life cycles are largely driven by consumer demand. Some products go gang-busters for years while others simply go bust. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">For A&D companies, program life cycles are driven by the vagaries of annual budgeting and appropriations processes, changing threats, requirements, and philosophies, program performance and, in some cases, political whims. The business consequences can occasionally be surreal, and the military impacts consequential. </span>

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">In the 21st century, unipolarity will destroy US legitimacy – US can’t deter conflict if the liberal order collapses</span>
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Maher</span>**, Ph.D. in pol sci,** <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">11</span> – Richard Maher, Ph.D. in Political Science from Brown University, Winter 2011, “The Paradox of American Unipolarity: Why the United States May Be Better Off in a Post-Unipolar World,” Orbis, Vol. 55, No. 1, p. 53-68

Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, world politics has been unipolar, defined by American preponderance in each of the core components of state power—military, economic, and technological. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Such an imbalanced distribution of power in favor of a single country is unprecedented in the modern state system. This material advantage does not automatically translate into America’s preferred political and diplomatic outcomes</span>, however. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Other states, if now only at the margins, are challenging U.S. power and authority</span>. Additionally, on a range of issues, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the United States is finding it increasingly difficult to realize its goals and ambitions</span>. The even bigger challenge for policymakers in Washington is how to respond to signs that America’s unquestioned preeminence in international politics is waning. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This decline in the United States’ relative position is in part a consequence of the burdens and susceptibilities produced by unipolarity</span>. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. position both internationally and domestically may actually be strengthened once this period of unipolarity has passed</span>. On pure material terms, the gap between the United States and the rest of the world is indeed vast. The U.S. economy, with a GDP of over $14 trillion, is nearly three times the size of China’s, now the world’s second-largest national economy. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The United States today accounts for approximately 25 percent of global economic output, a figure that has held relatively stable despite steadily increasing economic growth in China, India, Brazil, and other countries</span>. Among the group of six or seven great powers, this figure approaches 50 percent. When one takes discretionary spending into account, the United States today spends more on its military than the rest of the world combined. This imbalance is even further magnified by the fact that five of the next seven biggest spenders are close U.S. allies. China, the country often seen as America’s next great geopolitical rival, has a defense budget that is one-seventh of what the United States spends on its military. There is also a vast gap in terms of the reach and sophistication of advanced weapons systems. By some measures, the United States spends more on research and development for its military than the rest of the world combined. What is remarkable is that the United States can do all of this without completely breaking the bank. Th<span style="font-size: 16px;">e United States today devotes approximately 4 percent of GDP to defense. As a percentage of GDP, the United States today spends far less on its military than it did during the Cold War,</span> when defense spending hovered around 10 percent of gross economic output. As one would expect, the United States today enjoys unquestioned preeminence in the military realm. No other state comes close to having the capability to project military power like the United States.1 <span style="font-size: 16px;">And yet, despite this material preeminence, the United States sees its political and strategic influence diminishing around the world</span>. It is involved in two costly and destructive wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, where success has been elusive and the end remains out of sight. China has adopted a new assertiveness recently, on everything from U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, currency convertibility, and America’s growing debt (which China largely finances). Pakistan, one of America’s closest strategic allies, is facing the threat of social and political collapse. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Russia is using its vast energy resources to reassert its dominance in what it views as its historical sphere of influence</span>. Negotiations with North Korea and Iran have gone nowhere in dismantling their nuclear programs. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Brazil’s growing economic and political influence offer another option for partnership and investment for countries in the Western Hemisphere. And relations with Japan, following the election that brought the opposition Democratic Party into power, are at their frostiest in decades. To many observers, it seems that </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">America’s vast power is not translating into America’s preferred outcomes. </span>//As the United States has come to learn, <span style="font-size: 16px;">raw power does not automatically translate into the realization of one’s preferences, nor is it necessarily easy to maintain one’s predominant position in world politics. There are many costs that come with predominance – material, political, and reputational</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">. Vast imbalances of power create apprehension and anxiety in others, in one’s friends just as much as in one’s rivals.</span>// In this view, it is not necessarily //American// predominance that produces unease but rather American //predominance//. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Predominance also makes one a tempting target, and a scapegoat for other countries’ own problems and unrealized ambitions</span>. Many a Third World autocrat has blamed his country’s economic and social woes on an ostensible U.S. conspiracy to keep the country fractured, underdeveloped, and subservient to America’s own interests. Predominant power likewise breeds envy, resentment, and alienation. How is it possible for one country to be so rich and powerful when so many others are weak, divided, and poor? //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Legitimacy—the perception that one’s role and purpose is acceptable and one’s power is used justly—is indispensable for maintaining power and influence in world politics. </span>//As we witness the emergence (or re-emergence) of great powers in other parts of the world, we realize that <span style="font-size: 16px;">American predominance cannot last forever. It is inevitable that the distribution of power and influence will become more balanced in the future</span>, and that the United States will necessarily see its relative power decline. W<span style="font-size: 16px;">hile the United States naturally should avoid hastening the end of this current period of American predominance, it should not look upon the next period of global politics and international history with dread or foreboding. </span>It certainly should not seek to maintain its predominance at any cost, devoting unlimited ambition, resources, and prestige to the cause. In fact, contrary to what many have argued about the importance of maintaining its predominance, <span style="font-size: 16px;">America’s position in the world—both at home and internationally—could very well be strengthened once its era of preeminence is over. It is, therefore, necessary for the United States to start thinking about how best to position itself in the ‘‘post-unipolar’’ world.</span>

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Effective US leadership is necessary to solve all future scenarios for conflict – Russia and China are key game players who the US must get on board in global politics</span>
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Larson</span>, pol sci prof, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">10</span>—Larson & Shevchenko 10 – Deborah Welch Larson, Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Alexei Shevchenko, Assistant Professor of Political Science at California State University, Fullerton, Spring 2010, “Status Seekers: Chinese and Russian Responses to U.S. Primacy,” International Security, Vol. 34, No. 4, p. 63-95
Since the end of the Cold War, scholars and foreign policy analysts have debated the type of world order that the United States should strive to create—a hegemonic system, a multilateral institutional system, or a great power concert.1 Initially, a major issue was whether attempts to maintain U.S. primacy would stimulate counterbalancing from other states.2 But since the 2003 Iraq War, a new consideration has emerged—how to persuade other states to cooperate with U.S. global governance. 3 <span style="font-size: 16px;">States that do not oppose efforts by the United States to maintain stability may nonetheless decline to follow its leadership</span>. This is a matter for concern because <span style="font-size: 16px;">although the United States can act alone, it cannot succeed on such issues as controlling terrorism, curbing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), rebuilding failed states, or maintaining economic stability without help from other states.</span> Among the states whose support is critical are China and Russia. <span style="font-size: 16px;">China, which in modern times has never been accorded great power status, has experienced impressive economic growth and is rapidly rising in the international system. China’s ascendance creates expectations</span> of an uncertain power transition in the Asia-Pacific region and potentially in world politics, one <span style="font-size: 16px;">that could be accompanied by dangerous competition. Then there is Russia, a former superpower</span> and (after a decade of post-Soviet retrenchment complicated by gross internal mismanagement) most recently a resurgent power because of a rise in energy prices, <span style="font-size: 16px;">a power that has not yet found a place in world politics</span>. Obtaining cooperation from China and Russia is more complex and difficult because they are outsiders from the liberal Western community, with differing values and interests.4 <span style="font-size: 16px;">In contrast, as a long-standing democracy, rising power India is more susceptible to appeals to common values</span>, especially since the 2006 nuclear agreement with the United States recognized India’s status as a nuclear power.5 <span style="font-size: 16px;">With China and Russia, the problem is how to obtain their cooperation with U.S. global governance if they cannot be integrated into the West.</span> The <span style="font-size: 16px;">United States needs Chinese and Russian assistance to curb proliferation of WMD, control terrorism, maintain stable energy supplies, and stabilize Eurasia</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">China and Russia have permanent seats on the United Nations (UN) Security Council, allowing them to veto resolutions authorizing intervention or sanctions against would-be proliferators or aggressors</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">China and Russia also have political ties with Iran and North Korea</span> that could make them useful intermediaries. Because of its economic aid and geographic proximity, China is an essential interlocutor with North Korea; Russia is a major arms supplier and economic partner with Iran. Russia has thousands of nuclear weapons and tons of nuclear materials, both coveted by rogue states and terrorist groups. <span style="font-size: 16px;">As the second-largest oil exporter and the holder of the world’s largest gas reserves, Russia can affect global energy supplies and prices. Russia could provide help as a transit route for U.S. military supplies and source of intelligence for the U.S. effort to stabilize Afghanistan</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">As the dominant power in Central Asia, Russia can assist in maintaining stability in this energy-rich region, an area that is increasingly important to China as well. The United States needs to work with China to stabilize security relationships in the Asia-Pacific region, head off regional rivalries, and prevent dangerous conºict resulting from a North Korean implosion</span>. Scholars have debated whether future Chinese and Russian foreign policies will contribute to global stability.6 Both states have been reluctant to agree to tough sanctions on North Korea and Iran to stop their nuclear programs.7 <span style="font-size: 16px;">As China’s consumption of energy has grown, Beijing has been actively competing for control of energy resources around the world</span>, sometimes in rogue states such as Burma, Iran, and Sudan.8 China has used the growing wealth of its economy to modernize its military, increasing its ability to coerce Taiwan or seize disputed territory in the East and South China Seas.9 Russia has been trying to exert influence over the post-Soviet space by such means as cutting off the supply of oil and gas,10 and most dramatically, its August 2008 incursion into Georgia followed by recognition of the breakaway republics Abkhazia and South Ossetia.11 Both China and Russia have sold arms to objectionable regimes such as Burma, Iran, Syria, and Venezuela.12 Securing Chinese and Russian cooperation requires understanding the objectives and logic of their grand strategies and devising effective policies to achieve that goal. In what follows, we demonstrate that despite apparent shifts and turns, Chinese and Russian foreign policies since the end of the Cold War have been motivated by a consistent objective—to restore both countries’ great power status. <span style="font-size: 16px;">We argue that China and Russia will be more likely to participate in global governance if the United States can find ways to recognize their distinctive status and identities. States’ concerns about their relative status have been largely overlooked by</span> the dominant theoretical approaches of <span style="font-size: 16px;">neorealism and liberalism</span>.13 <span style="font-size: 16px;">Neorealism focuses on material components of power, whereas liberalism is oriented around norms, institutions, and economic interdependence. These approaches have limited utility for persuading China and Russia to cooperate because neither country needs economic or security assistance from the West,</span> and they do not subscribe to Western liberal democratic norms. For insights into the role of status in international politics, we draw on social identity theory (SIT), which explores how social groups strive to achieve a positively distinctive identity.14 When a group’s identity is no longer favorable, it may pursue one of several strategies: social mobility, social competition, or social creativity. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Social mobility emulates the values and practices of the higher-status group with the goal of gaining admission into elite clubs. Social competition tries to equal or surpass the dominant group in the area on which its claims to superior status rest. Finally, social creativity reframes a negative attribute as positive or stresses achievement in a different domain</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Applied to international relations, SIT suggests that states may improve their status by joining elite clubs, trying to best the dominant states, or achieving preeminence outside the arena of geopolitical competition</span>.15 We apply a theoretical framework based on SIT to case studies of changes in Chinese and Russian grand strategy since the end of the Cold War as a plausibility probe.16 <span style="font-size: 16px;">Our study indicates that China and Russia initially sought great power status through partial acceptance of Western capitalist norms but were denied integration</span> into elite-Western clubs. Both states turned to more competitive policies but did not enhance their relative standing. Rather than adjust to the U.S.-led liberal democratic system, China and Russia sought to develop new, more positive images by contributing to global governance while maintaining distinctive identities. <span style="font-size: 16px;">China has been remarkably successful in changing other states’ perceptions of its identity, whereas Russia’s cooperation was largely taken for granted.</span> Russia’s foreign policy is currently in a transitional phase with some elements of social competition. Our case studies suggest that the desire for greater status may motivate rising powers to take on more responsibility for maintaining world order. For this outcome to occur, the dominant power, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the United States, must offer recognition of the rising state’s more positive identity and status. Overall U.S. predominance allows the United States to recognize other countries’ achievements and contributions in the area of global governance without detracting from its own status.</span> Use of status incentives should receive greater consideration as a tool of global governance. We begin by discussing the basic propositions of SIT, showing why groups are motivated to achieve positive distinctiveness. We then elaborate and conceptualize the SIT typology of identity management strategies, providing applications to international relations. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This theoretical framework is then used to explain major shifts in Chinese and Russian grand strategy since the end of the Cold War, and especially the adoption of more cooperative policies</span>. The conclusion identifies contributions of SIT to understanding otherwise puzzling Chinese and Russian behavior.

<span style="font-size: 16px;">There is a reason that</span> regimes like <span style="font-size: 16px;">Iran and North Korea</span> go to the time and expense, and assume the risks of <span style="font-size: 16px;">developing nuclear weapons</span> programs; nuclear capability empowers them to achieve their ends, and thereby <span style="font-size: 16px;">poses challenges to the </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">U</span>//nited //<span style="font-size: 16px;">S</span>//tates, for several reasons. First, there is a danger that <span style="font-size: 16px;">rogue regimes</span> with nuclear material <span style="font-size: 16px;">may assist terrorists in developing </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">weapons of mass destruction</span>//.[36] Even the possibility that such regimes may do so gives them leverage internationally. Second, these regimes have ambitions in their regions and around the world.[37] <span style="font-size: 16px;">Some of their leaders are </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">fanatical enough to actually consider a first strike using nuclear weapons</span>//; for example, <span style="font-size: 16px;">high-ranking officials of</span> the <span style="font-size: 16px;">Iran</span>ian government <span style="font-size: 16px;">have openly discussed using a nuclear weapon against Israel</span>.[38] Whether a first strike occurs or not, the possession of nuclear capability frees aggressive regimes to pursue their other goals violently with less fear of retaliation. For example, <span style="font-size: 16px;">North Korea’s nuclear capability means that it could </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">attack South</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">Korea</span>// conventionally with a measure of impunity; even if the attack failed, the United States and its allies would be less likely to remove the North Korean regime in retaliation. In other words, <span style="font-size: 16px;">nuclear capability lessens the penalties</span> which could be exacted on North Korea if it engages in aggression, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">which makes the aggression more likely</span>//. The same logic applies to Iran, which is why the other nations in the Middle East are so concerned about Iran’s nuclear program. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A nuclear attack by Iran is possible</span>, but the real danger of <span style="font-size: 16px;">Iranian nuclear capability</span> is that it <span style="font-size: 16px;">would make </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">conventional aggression in the region more likely</span>//.[39] Finally, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the more nations that get nuclear weapons, </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">the</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">greater the pressure on other nations to acquire them</span>// as a deterrent, <span style="font-size: 16px;">and this is particularly true when a government</span> acquiring the capability <span style="font-size: 16px;">is seen as </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">unstable or aggressive</span>//. North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons has tended, for obvious reasons, to make the South Koreans and Japanese uncomfortable about having no deterrent themselves. The possibility of uncontrolled proliferation—what experts call <span style="font-size: 16px;">a “nuclear cascade</span>”[40]—<span style="font-size: 16px;">is </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">tremendously dangerous</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">; it increases the possibility that terrorists can get nuclear material</span> from a national program, <span style="font-size: 16px;">and it raises the prospect of a </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">multilateral nuclear confrontation</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;"> between nations</span>.[41] Many of <span style="font-size: 16px;">the smaller nuclear nations do not have</span> well-established <span style="font-size: 16px;">first strike doctrine</span> or launch protocols; <span style="font-size: 16px;">the chance of a nuclear exchange, accidental or intentional, increases </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">geometrically</span>// //<span style="font-size: 16px;">when a confrontation is multilateral.

Political instability in Afghanistan would spillover, collapsing Pakistan and risks an all out nuclear war over power vacuum in Kabul
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Grant, </span>Governance, Strategy & Terrorism Section Director at The Henry Jackson Society,<span style="font-size: 16px;"> 10</span> [George Grant is the Governance, Strategy & Terrorism Section Director at The Henry Jackson Society, the author of a number of briefing papers with relevance in this field, including an analysis of the political, economic and philosophical drivers of radical Islamism in the Muslim World as well as a report on China’s rise in Africa, and what it means for the continent’s democratic and economic prospects, Masters Degrees in History, “Succeeding in Afghanistan,” Henry Jackson Society: Project for Democratic Geopolitics is a crosspartisan, British think-tank, 2010, [[http://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com/documents/Succeeding_in_Afghanistan.pdf]]]
In addition to <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">increasing the risk to Western national security</span>, failure in Afghanistan <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">would also generate the possibility of widespread regional instability.The country</span> likely to be most severely affected <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">would be neighbouring, nuclear-armed Pakistan</span>, and this is the principal reason why the government in Islamabad has finally started to take the threat posed by the Taliban seriously. Not only would t<span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">he Pakistan-Taliban be rejuvenated psychologically, the material and logistical assistance that they would receive from across the border could seriously enhance the threat they pose to the Pakistani government.</span> For all the focus on Afghanistan, <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">the threat posed to Pakistan by insurgents is not one to be underestimated</span>. It is worth recalling the events of <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">April 2009</span>, when a resurgent <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Taliban advanced to within just 60 miles of Islamabad, prompting very real concerns of a Taliban takeover of the country and its nuclear arsenal</span>.110 It is also worth recalling that what precipitated this resurgence was the capitulation of the Pakistani government in the Swat Valley, granting carte blanche to the Taliban to exercise administrative and judicial control, thus placing even more territory in the hands of the Taliban, having already lost control of most of its tribal agencies bordering Afghanistan. <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">To cede control of Afghanistan to the Taliban, even in just those regions bordering Pakistan, could result in a rejuvenation of the insurgency across the border which would, in the worst case scenario, pose an existential threat to Pakistan, and the seemingly fantastical but nonetheless real possibility of its nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of the Taliban</span>. The consequences of this scenario would be dire indeed. The absolutely <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">unacceptable prospect of the Taliban gaining control of a nuclear arsenal would surely precipitate a massive incursion by Western countries or by India, with the potential to throw not only Pakistan, but the entire region into massive conflict.</span> This is, however, the worst-case scenario and one that is unlikely to come to pass, though it is by no means impossible. More likely is that Pakistan would be able to withstand a renewed insurgency, but the fallout in terms of civilian deaths, <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">displacement and further instability would nonetheless be severe</span>. The wider <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">potential for instability in the region would come from the power struggle that would ensue amongst regional actors to ensure that a regime amenable to their own ambitions emerged in Kabul,</span> or at least to prevent the emergence of a hostile regime. It is no secret that <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">the rationale behind Pakistan’s support for the Taliban during the 1990s was the perceived necessity of countering the influence of India in the country,</span> which was lending its support to non-Taliban elements, principally the Northern Alliance.111 In the wake of the 2001 invasion India was quick to lend serious diplomatic and economic assistance to the new government in Kabul. Several thousand Indians are involved in over a billion dollars worth of development projects in Afghanistan, from road-building, to sanitation projects, to the digging of wells, to the erection of power transmission lines and more besides. India is even constructing the country’s new parliament building.112 The ability of India, with an economy more than six times the size of Pakistan, to overshadow the latter’s own assistance efforts has already set alarm bells ringing in Islamabad. “Who is the beneficiary of this war on terror that requires the collaboration of Pakistan?” a retired Pakistani officer was recently quoted as asking. “India is again in Afghanistan, working against us.”113 <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">In the event of a collapse of authority in Afghanistan this power- struggle would only escalate as not only India and Pakistan sought to fill the vacuum, but potentially other regional actors, including Iran and Russia</span>.

Collapse draws in all-out war with India and US – goes nuclear – all efforts to solve incentivize their use

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">It appears that the success or failure of any U.S. or international effort to secure Pakistan’s nuclear weapons will rely, to a high degree, on how well America’s “spies”, and those of cooperating states, have been able to infiltrate Pakistan’s jihadist groups, and on the friendships that military officers, U.S. and British in particular, have been able to form over the years with their Loyalist Pakistani counterparts. But even </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">assuming that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons can be located</span>. <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">there is stil</span>l <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">significant </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">uncertainty as to whether they can be disabled or secured.</span> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Even if intelligence correctly pinpoints the location of the nuclear weapons storage sites controlled by Islamist Pakistani Army units</span>, <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">the United States still confronts several problems in seizing</span> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">or de- stroying </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">these weapons</span>. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">First</span>, <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">any air strike or insertion of ground forces would likely require surprise</span> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">to succeed</span>. <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Forewarned, the Islamists would likely reposition the weapons or, even worse, try to use them</span>. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">If surprise were achieved, however. U.S. and other military observers believe another problem must be addressed: </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">the weapons are likely stored in deep underground chambers, impervious to</span> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">destruction by even the most powerful American “bunker buster" </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">precision-guided munitions</span>. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">sometimes referred to as “smart bombs.” There have been reports that the U.S. government has developed very low-yield, highly accurate “pre- cision” earth-penetrating nuclear weapons in anticipation of this prob- lem." However, it is doubtful that any U.S. president would authorize the first use of American nuclear weapons, even under these circumstances. Finally;</span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"> it might be necessary to destroy or neutralize all of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons</span> (<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">or at least those not given to the Jihadists simultaneously</span>. <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">The Islamist army elements would have great incentive to em- ploy at least some of the weapons that survived any U.S. strike</span>. <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">lest they be lost in any follow-on attacks. The likely targets of Islamist nuclear ret- rihution strikes would be Pakistani Loyalist forces, India, and U.S. forces in neighboring Afghanistan</span>. If Loyalist units are hit, <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">the temptation on their part to retaliate in kind against Islamist forces or jihadist strong- holds may be irresistible. Should lndia be attacked. a full-scale nuclear exchange involving dozens. and perhaps hundreds, of warheads may ensue.</span> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">There are indications that </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">New Delhi would retaliate with scores of nuclear weapons to ensure it destroyed every Pakistani nuclear weapon.</span>" <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">While U.S. air and missile defenses now positioned in the area may be able to intercept some Pakistani nuclear weapons launched against India. there are no guarantees that they will he able to intercept every aircraft or missile. It is, of course, possible that the attacks may be mounted employing nontraditional means (e.g., hy smuggling a weapon across the Indian border, employing a small commercial aircraft on a “kaniikaze” strike, or trucking one into a Loyalist arm). Simply put, there is no shortage of risks involved in taking action, as military plan- ners readily concede. </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">lf the United States attempts to take out Pakistan‘s nuclear forces and fails to eliminate them all. Washington may he blamed for acting but not succeeding, even though doing nothing may be the worst option of all</span>. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Again we come back to the critical importance of having detailed intelligence regarding the location of Pakistan weapons and the ability to strike quickly and effectively. The challenges associated with securing the nuclear weapons trans- ferred to the jihadists are no less formidable, even assuming the U.S. military can identify where the weapons are located. If the weapons are held by a small group of jihadists, and if their location can be precisely defined, and if the location is in a sparsely populated area, the clandestine insertion of elite U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOP) troops would he one possible means ol' securing the weapons, particularly il' they are inserted immediately following an air strike that kills or clisperses the ji- hadists. But this option relies for its success on an uncomfortable number of “ifs." In any event, a combined air-SOF strike may prove difficult to pull off. Although their development has long been discussed</span>, <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">another problem confronting the U.S. military is its lack of long-range stealthy SOF aircraft, </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">both planes and helicopters, to move these forces over the great distances that will be required to penetrate deep into Pakistan, while also avoiding detection. Equally worrisome is how the captured nuclear weapon and the U.S. troops guarding it will be evacuated. It is unlikely that the aircraft that transport the Special Forms will be able to land in Pakistan. let alone refuel there.” Yet another concern is that if the weapons are found to he in a densely populated area, a much larger force will he required to seize them, reducing the chances for surprise while greatly increasing the possibility of civilian casualties. lt would take days to organize and transport such a large force. Military commanders thus confront the problem of time. Once intelligence reports the suspected location of a weapon, the clock is ticking. If the Jihadists are smart, and one must assume they are, they are likely moving their weapons on a regular basis. The longer it takes to organize and deploy a search team and the associated forces, the greater the chance that they will arrive to find-nothing. This planning factor is critical for U.S. commanders. </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">The military has only a small number of Special Forces and even less in the way of air transportation assets</span>. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">It cannot afford at failed snatch mission. A just-published article in Janes Defence Weekly states that the entire U.S. military has sufficient assets to con- duct at most two or three of these snatch raids simultaneously.“ Thus the intelligence must he of the highest grade, U.S. forces must operate with the greatest speed, and the operations must he superbly coordi- nated. </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Once the jihadists realize that the snatch operations are under way, their incentive to use these weapons, rather than have them seized, will likely increase dramatically.</span>

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">No Offense – multilateral institutions are necessary to solve all global problems – Unipolarity destroys every chance for solvency </span>
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Brumberg, 3 (</span>Daniel, Harvard International Review, [[http://www.carnegieendowment.org]])

<span style="font-size: 16px;">US hegemonic ambition runs counter to the realities of a globalizing world. It openly contradicts the concept of sovereignty</span> in today's world and is in conflict with the principles of free information, open borders, and more integrated trade and financing. <span style="font-size: 16px;">It</span> also <span style="font-size: 16px;">ignores our common vulnerability to threats-ranging from terrorism and weapons of mass destruction to environmental degradation and the spread of diseases-which require close cooperation among all members of the international community, including both state and nonstate actors</span>. The multitude of open interactions among state and nonstate entities within and across national boundaries indicates the emergence of a global civil society, which in turn will call increasingly for global accountability. Thus, domestic constituencies should not be the exclusive focus of responsible national governments. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The emerging world public opinion</span>, facilitated by improved communication technologies and greater circulation of information, <span style="font-size: 16px;">appreciates the interdependence of domestic and foreign politie</span>s, which greatly constrains national governments. <span style="font-size: 16px;">World public opinion is weighing more and more in domestic decision-making processes-a trend that the US administration tends to underestimate</span>. The new initiative recently undertaken by the US State Department to better inform the global community of US policies is a belated but welcome recognition of the need for global accountability. However, <span style="font-size: 16px;">a careful analysis of global trends would indicate that resentment of US policy across the world does not emanate solely from lack of information or misperceptions about US policies. Rather, it represents the serious apprehension of well-informed people both outside and within the United States about the rising unilateral tendencies of the Bush administration.</span>


America is declining, but not at a disastrous rate, controlling the information age is essential to peacefully deal with the rise of the rest – failure means we don’t shift to multipolarity

<span style="font-size: 16px;">It is time for a new narrative about the future of U.S. power</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Describing power transition</span> in the twenty-first century <span style="font-size: 16px;">as</span> a traditional age of //<span style="font-size: 16px;">hegemonic decline in inaccurate, and it can lead to dangerous policy implications if it encourages china to engage in adventurous policies or the United States to overreact out of fear</span>//. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The United States is not in absolute decline, and in relative terms, there is a reasonable probability that </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">it will remain more powerful than any single state in the coming decades</span>//. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">At the same time, the country will certainly face a rise in the power resources of many other—both state and nonstate actors.</span>// <span style="font-size: 16px;">Because globalization will spread technological capabilities and information technology will allow more people to communicate, U.S. culture and the U.S. economy will become less locally dominant than they were at the start of this century. </span>Yet <span style="font-size: 16px;">it is unlikely that the United States will decay</span> like ancient Rome, <span style="font-size: 16px;">or even that it will be surpassed by another state, including China</span>. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">The problem of American power in the twenty-first century, then, is not on of decline but what to do in the light of the realization that even the largest country cannot achieve the outcomes it wants without the help of others</span>//. <span style="font-size: 16px;">An increasing number of challenges will require the United States to exercise power with others as much as power over others. This, in turn, </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">will require a deeper understanding of power, how it is changing, and how to construct “smart power” strategies that combine hard- and soft-power resources in an information age</span>//. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The country’s capacity to maintain alliances and create networks will be an important dimension of its hard and soft power</span>. Power is not good or bad per se. It is like calories in a diet: more is not always better. If a country has too few power resources, it is less likely to obtain its preferred outcomes, but too much power (in terms of resources) has often proved to be a curse when it leads to overconfidence and inappropriate strategies. Davide Slew goliath because Goliath’s superior power resources led him to pursue an inferior strategy, which in turn led to he defeat and death. A smart-power narrative for //<span style="font-size: 16px;">the twenty-first century is not about maximizing power or preserving hegemony. It is about finding way to combine resources in successful strategies in the new context of power diffusion and the “rise of the rest</span>//.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">As the largest power, the United States will remain important in global affairs, but the twentieth century narrative about an American century and American primacy-as well as narratives of American decline—s misleading when it is used as a guide to the type of strategy that will e necessary in the twenty-first century</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The coming decades are not likely to see a post-American world, but the United States will need a smart strategy that combines hard- and soft-power resources—and that emphasizes alliances and networks that are responsive to the new context of a global informational age</span>.

Other countries are pursuing information sharing – US needs to act now to compete for and secure influence in the information age
John J. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Garstka</span>, assistant director for concepts and operations in the Office of Force Transformation, Office of the Secretary of Defense. He has spoken and written extensively on the topic of warfare in the information age, 20<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">03</span> [“Network-Centric Warfare Offers Warfighting Advantage”, Signal Online, May, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=235&zoneid=62]]</span>, mcG]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Datalinks are the new weapon of the information age</span>. The term network-centric warfare broadly describes the combination of emerging tactics, techniques and procedures that a networked force can employ to create a decisive warfighting advantage. According to John Keegan, author of A History of Warfare, it is similar to the significant warfighting developments of the industrial age and agrarian age in that <span style="font-size: 16px;">network-centric warfare seeks to exploit an order of magnitude change in an underlying source of power to increase warfighting advantage dramatically.</span> Paula Kaufman, in an article she wrote for IEEE Spectrum, agrees with this opinion<span style="font-size: 16px;">. In the industrial age, power was primarily derived from mass and the sources of power for moving mass. In the information age, power is increasingly derived from information sharing, information access and speed,</span> she says. The advantages network-centric warfare brings to the battlespace are particularly relevant to the tactical and operational levels of war, but they impact all levels of military activity from the tactical to the strategic. Although <span style="font-size: 16px;">the construct of an information advantage may seem somewhat intangible, it can be measured, and its impact on military operations can be evaluated in terms of mission effectiveness, survivability and lethality</span>—coins of the realm used by warfighters across the ages. Evidence of the power of network-centric warfare accumulated from a wide range of activities, including combat operations, training events, exercises and demonstrations, continues to strengthen and reinforce its existing tenets. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A U.S. Defense Department 2001 report to Congress about network-centric warfare enumerates several specific points: A robustly networked force improves information sharing; information sharing and collaboration enhances the quality of information and shared situational awareness; shared situational awareness enables collaboration and self-synchronization and enhances sustainability and speed of command; and these in turn dramatically increase mission effectiveness. </span>Although the margin of victory has varied across mission areas, the outcome has consistently been decisive in favor of forces that are robustly networked. In some tactical engagements, <span style="font-size: 16px;">superior platforms were decisively defeated by less capable platforms that leveraged the order of magnitude improvement in information sharing that networking enables.</span> In other engagements, digitized and networked ground forces with a reduced number of platforms were able to substitute information for mass and outperform units that had fought with a larger number of platforms not similarly digitized and networked. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Even more impressive, the combination of networked and digitized ground and air forces was able to defeat an opposition force decisively with unprecedented lethality by creating and leveraging an information advantage</span>. Most recently, military operations in support of operation Enduring Freedom highlighted the emergence of near-real-time information sharing as a source of warfighting advantage. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The source of power was not new platforms, but rather the networking of the legacy platforms with special operations forces</span> (SOF). The extent to which ground-based SOF were able to share precision information with command and control aircraft and fighter, bomber and attack aircraft was unprecedented in military operations. It represented an order of magnitude increase in information sharing over what had been previously demonstrated anywhere in the world in combat operations. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Two of the more noteworthy and documented examples of the power of network-centric warfare are drawn from the air-to-air mission. In this mission area, a major contributor to enhanced survivability and lethality is an increase in shared situational awareness</span> and enhanced situational understanding. With audio-only communications, p<span style="font-size: 16px;">ilots and controllers must share information</span> generated by onboard sensors about opposing forces as well as their own position and status via voice. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Communicating the minimum essential information required to take offensive or defensive actions takes time, and the resulting situational awareness can often differ significantly from reality</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">In contrast, when datalinks are employed on fighter aircraft, digital information on blue and red forces is shared instantaneously, enabling all participants to share a common tactical picture. This improved information position constitutes a significant information advantage vis-à-vis an adversary fighting with voice-only communications. This information advantage in turn enables a cognitive advantage in the form of dramatically increased shared situational awareness and enhanced situational understanding. The result is that pilots flying datalink-equipped aircraft can achieve much higher levels of shared situational awareness and understanding on a timeline previously unachievable with voice-only communications. They can translate these advantages into increased survivability and lethality. One of the best examples of how networking and digitization can be leveraged to create an information advantage took place in a training exercise in the mid-1990s when Royal Air Force (RAF) Tornado aircraft from U.K. 29 Squadron with tactical datalinks defeated U.S. Air Force F-15Cs with voice-only communications in a series of air-to-air engagements that took place during a red flag exercise in the airspace over the Nellis Air Force Base range. Historically, the most favorable outcome that the absolute best RAF pilots could manage when flying against F-15Cs was a draw. However, when the RAF introduced a datalink in the form of Link-16, U.K. 29 Squadron pilots, flying with new innovative tactics, were able to increase their kill ratio over the F-15C equipped with voice-only communications to approximately 4-to-1. The power of information sharing to increase survivability and lethality in the air-to-air mission was substantiated by the Air Force again in the mid-1990s during a joint tactical information distribution system (JTIDS) operational special project. Air Force pilots flying F-15Cs with and without datalinks clearly demonstrated an order of magnitude increase in information sharing enabled by the datalinks. This operational special project consisted of hundreds of tactical engagements, ranging in size from two-versus-two to eight-versus-16 aircraft, which were conducted during day and night conditions. During the more than 12,000 sorties and more than 19,000 flying hours, the average kill ratio for F-15Cs equipped with datalinks increased by more than 150 percent over F-15Cs fighting with voice-only communications, according to a JTIDS operational special project report to Congress. An analysis of the growing body of evidence highlights a very strong relationship between information advantage, cognitive advantage and increased lethality and survivability at the tactical level. It shows that these relationships are not unique to the air-to-air mission but rather that they were demonstrated first in this mission area as a result of the relative maturity of the application of networking technology in this arena. This same story line of increased warfighting effectiveness enabled by networking has been played out in counter special operations forces mission Fleet Battle Experiment Delta; counter anti-access, Fleet Battle Experiment Foxtrot; multinational rapid reaction forces, Allied Command Europe Mobile Force–Land; and combined arms maneuver warfare, Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I (DCX-I). During DCX-I, the blue force was digitized and networked to an unprecedented degree. Equally important, these forces were highly trained on this digital equipment and in many cases had developed new tactics, techniques and procedures to leverage their improved capability to operate in the information domain.</span> <span style="font-size: 16px;">The digitized and networked ground forces demonstrated significantly improved warfighting capabilities and were able to prevail over the opposing forces in a number of engagements</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">For example, during one phase of the exercise, the blue force was in a defensive posture with the opposing force moving to contact under the cover of darkness. A significant column of armor was detected by the joint surveillance target attack radar system and positively identified as hostile by a Hunter unmanned aerial vehicle, Col. Fred Stein, USA (Ret.), explains. An analysis of the real-time blue ground picture indicated that the attacking opposing force column was located approximately 10 miles from the brigade combat team’s defensive positions. The brigade commander, in consultation with the division commander, decided to engage the hostile force, and the fire mission was assigned to close air support. At this point, the engagement departed from the usual script, which had been characterized in the past by some as an exercise in futility, according to an internal correspondence from the Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Test Center. F-16s and A/OA-10s of the Arizona Air National Guard equipped with the situational awareness data link (SADL) performed a close-air-support mission. The networking of these aircraft enabled them to exchange real-time targeting information as well as to receive and display a forward trace of the blue ground picture. The result of this networking was more than an order of magnitude improvement in the ability of ground and air forces to share information. In addition to being equipped with SADL, the F-16s were equipped with Lightening II targeting pods and a mixed weapons load of GBU-12s and AGM-65D Mavericks. The Forward Air Controller–Airborne (FAC-A) determined that employing the F-16s as a coordinated pair would maximize combat power. In engaging the ground targets, the A/OA-10 FAC-A identified targets of interest and distributed sensor points of interest over SADL to facilitate sensor cueing by the F-16’s Lightening II targeting pod. Employing these tactics enabled each wave of two-ship pairs to engage tanks selectively and avoid dropping ordnance on less significant targets. The battle damage assessment of the first wave of F-16s was “two battalions rendered combat ineffective.” Follow-on flights of F-16s were equally lethal, according to the Air National Guard correspondence.</span> <span style="font-size: 16px;">The net result of this engagement was that this phase of the training exercise had to be recocked to enable ground forces to accomplish their training objectives for hasty defense and counterattack successfully, </span>Col. Stein says. This transformation of close air support at night from an exercise in futility to devastatingly effective combat highlights the efficacy of network-centric warfare. The impact of digitization and networking on the combined arms fight, specifically the impact of digital close air support, is described in an Army evaluation of DCX-I. “The National Training Center is a playing field that often humbles the visiting team,” it reports. “However, during the U.S. Army’s Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I, the visiting team, in the form of the U.S. Army’s 4th Infantry Division, supported by elements of the U.S. Air Force, including elements of the Arizona Air National Guard, were able to leverage the power of an order of magnitude increase in information sharing to turn the tables on the opposing forces on at least two occasions. Of particular significance was a devastating defeat of opposing forces at night by F-16 and A/OA-10 aircraft performing the close-air-support mission.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Worldwide, militaries are crafting their individual responses to the challenges and opportunities of the information age. They are taking actions that demonstrate an increased understanding of the sources of information age warfighting advantage</span>. A new vocabulary has developed that reflects the subtle variations in underlying strategies and core missions of militaries worldwide. To varying degrees, these actions also are reflected in emerging concepts and doctrine, focused investments in key enablers and well-crafted programs of experimentation. Besides network-centric warfare, currently used by the armed forces of the United States, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, other coined terms include Australia’s network-enabled warfare, the United Kingdom’s network-enabled capability, the Swedish armed forces’ network-based defense and the armed forces of the Republic of Singapore’s knowledge-based command and control. Each of these terms reflects its respective military’s ongoing response to the information age. Clearly, militaries worldwide are continuing to take a close look at network-centric warfare and related concepts for information age warfare. Evidently they like what they see.



If the US fails to maintain influence in shaping the new world order conflict with China will be inevitable

Liu Jianfei sees //<span style="font-size: 16px;">U.S. influence as indispensable in shaping a new world order and cautions China about taking “too high a profile,” or “seeking to be a leader” of the international system. “China still needs more time to develop and open up to the outside world,</span>//” he says. “//<span style="font-size: 16px;">Many are calling for China to be the new leader in the new world order, but we need to continue down the road of reform and development and not adopt hegemonic tendencies. China also needs the cooperation and trade of the United States and other Western countries in order to succeed”</span>// [14]. What emerges is a lively debate in China about whether the international system is undergoing a fundamental shift that heralds the decline of U.S. power. As evidenced by the wide range of opinions, experts are far from reaching agreement on the core question of whether the United States is in decline. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The vast majority maintains that the prevailing international structure of power will not last; it eventually will give way to a multipolar era in which China and other emerging economies have an increasing say about issues of global importance</span>. At the same time, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">many experts also caution that the transition to multipolarity will be a prolonged process, and that for the foreseeable future the United States will maintain its position at the helm of the international structure of power. Only a minority of experts view the United States as already in decline and the world on the cusp of becoming truly multipolar</span>//. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Conspicuously absent from the debate is discussion of how a multipolar system would operate and what role China would play in the new world order. Would a more equal power distribution among major powers result in greater competition or cooperation, in balancing or bandwagoning, for example</span>//? <span style="font-size: 16px;">If future international developments persuade Chinese leaders that the United States is in decline and that a multipolar world has arrived, Chinese experts will need to more closely examine such questions.</span> //<span style="font-size: 16px;">An emerging multipolar world could prompt Beijing to adopt a more assertive foreign policy and military posture,</span>// //<span style="font-size: 16px;">but could also provide incentives for China to be cooperative</span>//. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Tensions over territorial claims with the Philippines, Vietnam, and Japan continue to simmer, and a perceived power vacuum in the area could embolden China to assert greater influence over these disputed islands. Furthermore, the potential for China to adopt coercive policies against Taiwan is an ever-present danger looming over U.S.-China relations.</span>// Yet, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Beijing might instead see its interests best served by working cooperatively with the other major powers to ensure a soft landing as the world transitions from “one superpower, many major powers” to a new multipolar pattern. </span>//Significant disincentives will exist to a revisionist shift in China’s foreign and defense policies. Assertiveness or aggression by China would likely cause the other major powers to band together to counter the emergent Chinese threat. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Unless China perceives a threat to its vital interests</span>// (such as a declaration of independence by Taiwan),//<span style="font-size: 16px;"> Beijing may see strong incentives to act cautiously. The time may then come for China to </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">discard Deng Xiaoping’s dictum to “keep a low profile,” and </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">become the “responsible stakeholder” that the world hopes for rather than the next global hegemon.</span>//

TSAT secures All Military Satellite Systems – Anti-jamming, bandwidth, on the move communications
Alec <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Klein</span>, award-winning investigative business journalism, Journalism Prof Northwestern, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">08</span> [“Weapons Upgrade Faces Big Hurdles; Problems With Wireless Technology May Threaten Army's Ambitious Plan”, Washington Post, April 8, [[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Sci/sci.military.naval/2008-04/msg00764.html]]]
At risk also is <span style="font-size: 16px;">the development of the Transformational Satellite Communications program, or TSAT, an Air Force project that is supposed to work with Future Combat Systems.</span> The Defense Department is planning to cut about $4 billion of the TSAT budget over the next five years, partly because of congressional concerns about an expensive and technical project that already has been cut, delayed and restructured. The Air Force has yet to select a contractor for the project, though Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the two leading contenders, have both been working on development contracts. <span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT would be about 100 times faster than military satellites in orbit now, Air Force officials say. That's to an extent because the satellites would take advantage of the latest Internet technology to reroute communications traffic more efficiently, they say</span>. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT is expected to also provide more securely encrypted communications for Future Combat Systems to prevent enemies from intercepting or jamming signals</span>//. Until recently, military officials said the program would launch its first satellite in 2016, though now they say the schedule is uncertain. According to a 2006 report, the GAO said TSAT began without sufficiently mature technology, noting that costs have increased and the timetable has been delayed. Before the latest cutbacks, according to the Air Force, the program had increased by about $8 billion, or 50 percent, to $24 billion, including inflation. The new cutbacks will defer work, delaying the timetable and adding to the program's overall expense because of "the costs associated with extending the contract to perform necessary work," the military said. But Richard Pino, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the Air Force's TSAT program director, said "the technologies are all at the right levels of maturity."</span> Boeing's Muilenburg said the prospect of additional cuts should not pose a problem for Future Combat Systems. In lieu of TSAT, he said that the Army program could use current military and commercial satellites. Loren B. Thompson, a defense consultant at the Lexington Institute, a public policy think tank, said, however, that <span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT "is crucial to the secure networking capabilities that underpin" Future Combat Systems. Given the cutbacks, he said, "If TSAT collapses, which looks like a distinct possibility, soldiers may have to rely on links that are harder to access on the move, more vulnerable to jamming and interceptions, and offer nowhere near as much bandwidth</span>." Cristina Chaplain, who oversees the GAO's review of space systems, also said that //<span style="font-size: 16px;">"TSAT was being designed to support communications on the move, whereas other programs don't do that to the extent that's needed by" Future Combat Systems</span>//. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sorenson, the Army's chief information officer, <span style="font-size: 16px;">acknowledges that the development of TSAT and the other complementary programs represent a "high risk," but he said the military is attempting to manage that risk by developing the programs incrementally</span>. Rickey E. Smith, <span style="font-size: 16px;">a retired Army colonel who is part of the military team designing how Future Combat Systems will be used, said that if the complementary programs fail, the Army project would certainly be impacted, but so would other military services that depend on these technologies. </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">And he said that while the GAO does good work, "They've never seen a program they liked</span>//." For the GAO's Francis, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the question for his team of investigators is not whether they like these military programs but whether they will work in concert with Future Combat Systems.</span>


NCW impossible without TSATs – space is key
James W. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Canan</span>, former senior editor of Air Force Magazine, 06 [“Timing in Battle: The T-Sat Edge”, AEROSPACE AMERICA/JANUARY 20<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">06,</span> [[http://www.aiaa.org/Aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_Jan06_CAN.pdf|www.aiaa.org/Aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_Jan06_CAN.pdf]], mcG]
<span style="color: #094b98;">B</span>y all accounts, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the success of the Pentagon’s ambitious plan to transform the U.S. military into a network-centric force is riding on the</span> transformational satellite communications system (<span style="font-size: 16px;">T-Sat</span>) now in development. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Defense planners are convinced that full-scale military transformation and network-centric operations will be impossible to achieve without the spaceborne communications that the revolutionary T-Sat constellation would provide.The military has begun its transition to highly mobile, fast-reaction, quick-strike, netcentric forces that include increasing numbers of autonomous or semiautonomous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).It</span> therefore <span style="font-size: 16px;">requires ultrareliable, superswift communications among all sorts of sensor systems, weapons platforms, and command posts in the air, on land, and at sea around the globe. T-Sats will be the space element</span>, <span style="font-size: 16px;">and the sine qua non, of the military’s planned GIG </span>(global information grid)—its “Internet in the sky.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Thus the T-Sat system is seen as “the cornerstone of [the Defense Dept.’s] future information operations</span>,” <span style="font-size: 16px;">the “centerpiece of our future global communications network,” and “the heart of the DOD net-centric operations environment concept essential to all future operations,”</span> a Pentagon document proclaims.


Net-Centric Warfare is the only way to secure the information age – NCW will transform the military to match up with rising powers
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Arquilla 10</span> (John Arquilla, professor of defense analysis at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, MARCH/APRIL 2010, “The New Rules of War”, [[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/22/the_new_rules_of_war]])
In another sign of the gathering swarm, the August 2008 Russian incursion into Georgia, rather than being a blast from the Cold War past, heralded the possibility that more traditional armies can master the art of omnidirectional attack. In this instance, Russian regular forces were augmented by ethnic militias fighting all over the area of operations — <span style="font-size: 16px;">and there was swarming in cyberspace at the same time. Indeed, the distributed denial of service attack, long a staple of cyberwarriors, is a model form of swarming</span>. And in this instance, <span style="font-size: 16px;">Georgian command and control was seriously disrupted by the hackers</span>. Simultaneous attack from several directions might be at the very cutting edge in conflict, but its lineage is quite old. Traditional tribal warfare, whether by nomadic horse archers or bush fighters, always featured some elements of swarms. The zenith of this kind of fighting probably came with the 13th-century Mongols, who had a name for this doctrine: “Crow Swarm.” When the attack was not carried out at close quarters by charging horsemen, but was instead conducted via arrows raining down on massed targets, the khans called it “Falling Stars.” With such tactics, the Mongols carved out the largest empire the world has ever seen, and kept it for a few centuries. But swarming was eclipsed by the rise of guns in the 15th century, which strongly favored massed volley fire. Industrial processes encouraged even more massing, and mechanization favored large flank maneuvers more than small swarms. Now again, in an age of global interdependence replete with advanced information technologies, even quite small teams of fighters can cause huge amounts of disruption. There is an old Mongol proverb: “With 40 men you can shake the world.” Look at what al Qaeda did with less than half that number on Sept. 11, 2001. This point was made by the great British strategist B.H. Liddell Hart in his biography of T.E. Lawrence, a master of the swarm in his own right. Liddell Hart, writing in 1935, predicted that at some point “the old concentration of force is likely to be replaced by an intangibly ubiquitous distribution of force — pressing everywhere, yet assailable nowhere.” Now, <span style="font-size: 16px;">swarming is making a comeback, but at a time when few organized militaries are willing or able to recognize its return. </span>For the implications of this development — most notably, that fighting units in very small numbers can do amazing things if used to swarm — are profoundly destabilizing. The most radical change is this: Standing armies can be sharply reduced in size, if properly reconfigured and trained to fight in this manner. Instead of continually “surging” large numbers of troops to trouble spots, the basic response of a swarm force would be to go swiftly, in small numbers, and strike the attackers at many points. In the future, it will take a swarm to defeat a swarm. Almost 20 years ago, I began a debate about networks that blossomed into an unlikely friendship with Vice Adm. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Art Cebrowski, the modern strategic thinker most likely to be as well remembered as Alfred Thayer Mahan, the great American apostle of sea power. He was the first in the Pentagon power structure to warm to my notions of developing fighting networks, embracing the idea of opening lots of lateral communications links between “sensors and shooters</span>.” We disagreed, however, about the potential of networks. Cebrowski thought that “<span style="font-size: 16px;">network-centric warfare” could be used to improve the performance of existing tools</span> — including aircraft carriers — for some time to come. I thought that networking implied a wholly new kind of navy, one made up of small, swift vessels, many of them remotely operated. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Cebrowski</span>, who passed away in late 2005, <span style="font-size: 16px;">clearly won this debate</span>, as <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. Navy remains heavily invested in being a “few-large” force — if one that is increasingly networked</span>. In an implicit nod to David Ronfeldt’s and my ideas, the Navy even has a Netwar Command now. Swarming has also gained some adherents. The most notable has been Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, who famously used swarm tactics in the last great Pentagon war game, “Millennium Challenge 2002,” to sink several aircraft carriers at the outset of the imagined conflict. But rather than accept that something quite radical was going on, the referees were instructed to “refloat” the carriers, and the costly game — its price tag ran in the few hundred millions — continued. Van Riper walked out. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Today, some in the U.S. military still pursue the idea of swarming, mostly in hopes of employing large numbers of small unmanned aerial vehicles in combat</span>. But military habits of mind and institutional interests continue to reflect a greater audience for surges than swarms. What //<span style="font-size: 16px;">if senior military leaders wake up and decide to take networks and swarming absolutely seriously</span>//? If they ever do, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">it is likely that the scourges of terrorism and aggression will become less a part of the world system</span>//. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Such a military would be smaller but quicker to respond, less costly but more lethal. The world system would become far less prone to many of the kinds of violence that have plagued it</span>. Networking and swarming are the organizational and doctrinal keys, respectively, to the strategic puzzle that has been waiting to be solved in our time. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A networked U.S. military that knows how to swarm would have much smaller active manpower</span> — easily two-thirds less than the more than 2 million serving today — but would be organized in hundreds more little units of mixed forces. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The model for military intervention would be the 200 Special Forces “horse soldiers</span>” who beat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan late in 2001. Such teams would deploy quickly and lethally, with ample reserves for relieving “first waves” and dealing with other crises. <span style="font-size: 16px;">At sea, instead of concentrating firepower in a handful of large, increasingly vulnerable supercarriers, the U.S. Navy would distribute its capabilities across many hundreds of small craft armed with very smart weapons.</span> Given their stealth and multiple uses, submarines would stay while carriers would go. And in the air, the “wings” would reduce in size but increase in overall number, with mere handfuls of aircraft in each. Needless to say, networking means that these small pieces would still be able to join together to swarm enemies, large or small. Is such a shift feasible? Absolutely. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Big reductions in the U.S. military are nothing new. The massive demobilization after World War II aside, active forces were reduced 40 percent in the few years after the Vietnam War and by another third right after the end of the Cold War</span>. But the key is not so much in cutting as it is in redesigning and rethinking. But what happens if the status quo prevails and the potential of this new round of changes in strategic affairs is ignored or misinterpreted? Failure awaits, at ruinous cost. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">The most likely form catastrophe could take is that terrorist networks would stay on their feet long enough to acquire nuclear weapons</span>//. Even a handful of warheads in Osama bin Laden’s hands would give him great coercive power, as a network cannot be targeted for retaliation the same way a country can. Deterrence will lie in tatters. If there is ever to be a nuclear Napoleon, he will come from a terrorist network. Within the U.S. military, the danger is that senior commanders will fall back on a fatalism driven by their belief that both congressional and industrial leaders will thwart any effort at radical change. I have heard this objection countless times since the early 1990s, repeated mantra-like, all the way up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thus the mighty U.S. war machine is like a Gulliver trussed up by Lilliputian politicians and businessmen. The irony, however, is that <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. military has never been in a better position to gain acceptance for truly transformational change. Neither party in Congress can afford to be portrayed as standing in the way of strategic progress, and so, whatever the Pentagon asks for, it gets.</span> As for <span style="font-size: 16px;">defense contractors</span>, far from driving the agenda, they <span style="font-size: 16px;">are much too willing to give their military customers exactly what they demand</span> (rather than, perhaps, something better). <span style="font-size: 16px;">If the U.S. armed forces call for smaller, smarter weapons and systems to support swarming, they will get them. </span>Beyond the United States, <span style="font-size: 16px;">other countries' security forces are beginning to think along the lines of "many and small," are crafting better ways to "find," and are learning to swarm. Chinese naval thought today is clearly moving in this direction. Russian ground forces are, too</span>. Needless to say, <span style="font-size: 16px;">terrorist networks are still in the lead,</span> and not just al Qaeda. Hezbollah gave quite a demonstration of all three of the new rules of war in its summer 2006 conflict with Israel, a virtual laboratory test of nation versus network -- in which the network more than held its own. For the U.S. military, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">failing a great leap forward in self-awareness of the need for radical change, a downward budgetary nudge is probably the best approach</span>// -- despite President Barack Obama's unwillingness to extend his fiscal austerity program to security-related expenditures. This could take the form of a freeze on defense spending levels, to be followed by several years of, say, 10 percent annual reductions. To focus the redesign effort, a moratorium would be declared on all legacy-like systems (think aircraft carriers, other big ships, advanced fighters, tanks, etc.) while they are subjected to searching review. It should not be assumed that the huge sums invested in national defense have been wisely spent. <span style="font-size: 16px;">To most Americans who think that being strong on defense means devoting more resources and building bigger systems, this suggestion to cut spending will sound outrageous</span>. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">being smarter about defense might lower costs even as effectiveness improves. This pattern has held throughout the transformations of the last few decades, whether in farming or in industry. Why should the military be exempt? </span>There's real urgency to this debate. Not only has history not ended with the Cold War and the advent of commerce-driven globalization, but conflict and violence have persisted -- even grown -- into a new postmodern scourge.Indeed, it is ironic that, in an era in which the attraction to persuasive "soft power" has grown dramatically, coercive "hard power" continues to dominate in world affairs. This is no surprise in the case of rogue nations hellbent on developing nuclear arsenals to ensure their security, nor when it comes to terrorist networks that think their essential nature is revealed in and sustained by violent acts. But this primary reliance on coercive capabilities is also on display across a range of countries great and small, most notably the United States, whose defense policy has over the past decade largely become its foreign policy. From the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to simmering crises with North Korea and Iran, and on to longer-range strategic concerns about East Asian and Central European security, the United States today is heavily invested in hard-power solutions. And it will continue to be. But if the radical adjustments in strategy, organization, and doctrine implied by the new rules of war are ignored,<span style="font-size: 16px;"> Americans will go on spending more and getting less when it comes to national defense</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">.</span>**</span>**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Networks will persist until they have the capability to land nuclear blows</span>**<span style="font-size: 16px;">. Other countries will leapfrog ahead of the United States militarily, and concepts like "deterrence" and "containment" of aggression will blow away like leaves in the wind. </span>So it has always been. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Every era of technological change has resulted in profound shifts in military and strategic affairs</span>. History tells us that <span style="font-size: 16px;">these developments were inevitable, but soldiers and statesmen were almost always too late in embracing them -- and tragedies upon tragedies ensued. There is still time to be counted among the exceptions</span>, like the Byzantines who, after the fall of Rome, radically redesigned their military and preserved their empire for another thousand years. The U.S. goal should be to join the ranks of those who, in their eras, caught glimpses of the future and acted in time to shape it, saving the world from darkness.

===<span style="font-size: 1.1em;">Advantage Two – China</span>=== 
Growing Reliance on Information makes it the prime target for China. Military Communications will likely be exploited in a cyber war

Because platforms such a Worldview-1 and GeoEye-1 are commer- cial in nature, and not subject to expensive add-ons and countermeasures which would enhance their survivability, these <span style="font-size: 16px;">commercial satellites are highly vulnerable to potential PRC interference and destruction</span>. Indeed, <span style="font-size: 16px;">such satellites would present the PRC with an attractive target set in any future cross-strait crisis because the disabling of commercial satellites would serve a valuable military purpose without greatly escalating a crisis</span>. Theoretically the adversary would be blinded (at least partially) and yet would have no legal grounds to declare war. The <span style="font-size: 16px;">PRC employed just such a strategy in the 1995-96 Cross-Strait Missile Crisis</span>, using radar-jamming to blind a commercial SAR imagery satellite that was providing Taiwan with intelligence on PLA exercises and the PLA military buildup opposite Taiwan.234 //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Given</span>// this, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">government’s</span>// partial (and //<span style="font-size: 16px;">growing) reliance upon commercial satellites for</span>//imagery and //<span style="font-size: 16px;">communications certainly does represent an Achilles’ heellikely to be exploited by the PRC</span>//in any future conflict. How far such exploitation might go, and what affects it might have are subjects for the next chapter. In conclusion, this chapter has sought to describe the expanding U.S. reliance upon satellites, noting their economic value while primarily focusing on their military utility, to illustrate some of the ways space platforms are vital to the U.S. military’s revolution in military affairs. The Chinese ASAT test shows that the <span style="font-size: 16px;">U.S. military’s </span>unparalleled <span style="font-size: 16px;">space infrastructure</span>, while serving as an essential force-multiplier that gives the U.S. a tremendous edge in modern warfare, also <span style="font-size: 16px;">represents a weakness in the sense that it is particularly vulnerable to asymmetric interference and attack. This state of affairs is exacerbated as the U.S. military increasingly turns to commercial satellite providers</span> to offset budget overruns and scheduling delays in government-funded programs. Interestingly, the semi-classified military space budget did not drastically increase in the wake of the Chinese direct-assent ASAT test of last year despite the PRC action representing a significant, and troubling, alteration of both the PRC’s capabilities and intentions. We now turn to the next chapter to discuss the level of significance the Chinese development of counter-space weapons could have for U.S.-Sino relations in the coming years.



Cyber war reverses the nuclear taboo – new forms of war ensure accidental launch

The end of Cold War has led some to assume that <span style="font-size: 16px;">nuclear weapons</span>and nuclear deterrence <span style="font-size: 16px;">are passe.</span> Along with this, is a related <span style="font-size: 16px;">assumption that a revolution in high technology, conventional weaponry will accelerate the rate of nuclear political and military obsolescence. On the other hand, all concede that the "revolution in military affairs" is driven mostly by new technologies in information, communications, and electronics</span>. [1] New information and <span style="font-size: 16px;">communication technologies may enable new forms of war making, including information warfare, that are dysfunctional for deterrence stability with, or without, nuclear weapons. It is possible that the remnants of pax atomica will combine with attacks using the new strategies of information to produce an outcome no one favors: accidental or inadvertent nuclear war or escalation.</span> In order to proceed, we need a working definition of information warfare. A large literature offers candidate views on the concept of information warfare.

Alexander <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Neill</span>, head of the Asia Security Programme at the Royal United Services Institute, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">11</span> [“Viewpoint: A new Sino-US high-tech arms race?”, BBC News, Jan 11, [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-asia-pacific-12154991]]]
Beneath the veneer of official smiles and neatly choreographed handshakes at the defence summit in Beijing, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the Sino-US relationship remains fraught with uncertainty</span>. A year after military relations were frozen by Beijing in the wake of a $6.4bn (£4.1bn) arms package to Taiwan, the US request for a resumption of a substantial strategic dialogue has been given a lukewarm reception in Beijing. The People's Liberation Army's (PLA) appetite for engagement with the US has waned considerably over the last year. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Cementing its defence arrangement with Taiwan, and holding large-scale naval war games in China's back yard in recent months, the US has buttressed its alliances with its East Asian allies. These actions have fuelled resentment in China and fears of US military encirclement. US irritation is based on a recent spate of harassment by the PLA Navy and Chinese fishing vessels against the US Navy and its allies in the West Pacific</span>. The US is also frustrated with China's intransigence towards meaningful strategic dialogue on international security concerns, particularly while tension on the Korean peninsula remains high and nuclear proliferation by North Korea continues unchecked. But the Pentagon's visceral concern is its failure to detect the break-neck speed of Chinese military technological advances and its ability to curb an arms race in East Asia. 'Pressure point warfare' Despite recent headlines reporting the appearance of a Chinese stealth fighter prototype, of more concern to US military planners is the enabling technology that will produce the bite to China's military bark. This angst is focused on China's decade-long programme of military "informationisation" designed to leap-frog over US capabilities in the Pacific region. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The PLA is rapidly developing asymmetric warfare techniques against US command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance infrastructure, known as "C4ISR" in military parlance. </span>For China, with its inferior conventional military capabilities, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the key to gaining the upper hand in a conflict with the US is to gain dominance of the space theatre and to damage its digital nerve system</span>. China views space as a corner-stone of its future prosperity: a mandate from heaven for China's growth and military strength. For this reason, China is working hard to counter the Pentagon's monopoly in space and to build its own space-based deterrent. The <span style="font-size: 16px;">PLA's</span> doctrine of "pressure point warfare", a multi-layered approach using space, cyberspace and information operations alongside conventional capabilities is designed to cripple an adversary in one swift strike. This fast paced and high-tech military modernisation has led to the emergence of weapons systems and technology, which in certain theatres has <span style="font-size: 16px;">closed the military capability gap with the US considerably. These include directed energy, jamming and cyber attack technologies, designed to paralyse the US military machine</span>. The PLA has recently developed and successfully tested advanced anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons systems, demonstrating it can destroy or manoeuvre close to enemy satellites in space. ASAT weapons are part of a new genre of "assassin's mace" or surprise weapons aimed at the Pentagon's Achilles Heel in space and cyberspace. All of these capabilities require state of the art signals processing and communications systems, technology which China has been developing indigenously to create its own command and control architecture. Carrier fears <span style="font-size: 16px;">One of the most pressing concerns for the United States navy is the prospect of US aircraft carriers and other vessels being denied access to theatres of operation in the event that the US were dragged into a conflict over Taiwan or in support of its other Pacific allies.</span> Coined by Pentagon planners as China's "A2/AD" (Anti Access/Area Denial) strategy, the PLA would attempt to prevent US aircraft carriers from deploying to theatre, targeted by Chinese torpedoes, Cruise Missiles and Anti Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBMs). <span style="font-size: 16px;">PLA tacticians know that a successful strike against a moving US aircraft carrier requires advanced space-based targeting assets and an ability to penetrate the US ballistic missile defence umbrella</span>.



<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Chinese behavior proves they are realist and already think the US is a threat and are preparing for war</span>

Washington cocktail-party <span style="font-size: 16px;">conversations about China typically go something like this: A person from the China-as-a-peer-competitor school of thought says "I think China</span>, with its growing economy, growing military, and young, nationalistic population, <span style="font-size: 16px;">will only naturally lock horns with the U.S. in future decades." An advocate of the enmity-is-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy school responds "Maybe, but casting the Chinese in an adversarial role now will serve to drive them away from the U.S. </span>and from a friendship that I think they're open to." As the impasse is marked with polite sipping of the Cabernet Sauvignon, each guest searches for rescue by a more like-minded conversationalist. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Turning the tables on such an exchange is the new report</span> of //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Congress's U.S.-China Security Review Commission</span>//<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">.</span> Never mind what you chatterers think, the bipartisan report seems to interject, because <span style="font-size: 16px;">the die is cast: "China's leaders consistently characterize the United States as a 'hegemon,</span>' connoting a powerful protagonist and overbearing <span style="font-size: 16px;">bully that is China's major competitor, but they also believe that the United States is a declining power with important military vulnerabilities that can be exploited. China views itself as an emerging power." </span>Specifically, China's military leaders are focusing on several investments and advances cannot be mistaken for anything but preparations for conflict against the U.S. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">This focus is far from meaning that conflict is inevitable</span>//<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">.</span> It doesn't even rule out cooperation and close U.S.-China ties in a variety of areas. But it <span style="font-size: 16px;">should stop in its tracks any wishful thinking that China doesn't already see the U.S. as a potential military adversary</span>. It should also make apparent that <span style="font-size: 16px;">China's leaders</span>, for their part, <span style="font-size: 16px;">aren't worried that their planning will alienate the United States. Among China'</span>s U.S.-oriented military ambitions, it <span style="font-size: 16px;">seeks to advance its: Ability to sink a U.S. carrier</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">: </span>China has publicly stated that it intends to be able to sink an American aircraft carrier. Among the technologies that could allow China to do this are anti-ship cruise missiles, which China could fire from land across long distances, and which it is now developing. China is also developing an over-the-horizon radar network with which to track surface ships. China has reportedly bought from Russia eight new Kilo-class diesel subs. China, which already has four of the subs is to take delivery of the eight beginning in 2007. China's growing fleet of diesel subs is supplemented by a program to develop nuclear subs, the congressional report says. The nuclear sub development, called "Project 093," is to begin between 2003-05 and already has Russian cooperation. Whether this program will be successful is far from clear, however. In addition, China is acquiring the high-speed Russian anti-ship SS-22 Sunburn missile, and advanced wake-homing torpedoes. Some of these advances could be used in anti-submarine warfare against the U.S. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Focus on asymmetrical warfare</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">:</span>China's President Jiang Zemin in 1999 called for the People's Liberation Army to develop weapons with which a technologically inferior Chinese military might defeat a technologically superior U.S. one. More specifically, China seeks to develop "assassin's mace" weapons -- what Americans might call a "magic bullet" -- with which to attack U.S. vulnerabilities. This focus on "asymmetrical warfare" draws on two millennia of Chinese strategic tradition. The congressional report says China focuses on such weaknesses as U.S. reliance on computer networks, dependency on satellites for military reconnaissance, navigation, and communications. The Chinese also plan to target business communications, and specific systems such as the New York Stock Exchange computers or the communications and computers of airbases and carriers. Another example of an asymmetrical capability, though not one discussed in the report, is China's existing ability to launch a massive missile barrage against Taiwan or a traditional U.S. basing site such as Okinawa, Japan. The threat of such a barrage could pressure Japan to deny the U.S. access to Okinawa, thereby exploiting U.S. over-dependency on foreign bases in the event of a Taiwan conflict. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Focus on space: China has seven military satellites and is building more. It has a modest, two-satellite version of the U.S. Global Positioning System of satellites, and has plans to expand it. Other research on China published by the Pentagon has pointed out that the PLA is developing ground-based anti-satellite technology.</span> While these advances don't spell out a future in which China will be a U.S. "peer," China is definitely a "competitor." It would be convenient and reassuring to dismiss China's military advances and the recently announced expansion of its military spending by 17.6% as measures directed at the perennial tensions with Taiwan. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">the advances outlined here are focused on countering U.S. capabilities, not Taiwanese ones</span>. To be sure, <span style="font-size: 16px;">Chinese military planners may be calculating that the U.S. would get involved in a cross-strait military conflict. But there's more to China's range of investments than planning for a brush with the U.S. in the Taiwan Strait. </span>Rather, <span style="font-size: 16px;">China's military planners seem to think the possibility of a large-scale, future military conflict between them and the dominant Pacific power is real, and should be prepared for. That's not necessarily a bellicose conclusion, it's just realist. And since it's Beijing's conclusion</span>, __<span style="font-size: 16px;">there's no reason Washington should draw a different one</span>____<span style="font-size: 16px;">. </span>__

Satellite Vulnerability leads china to act offensively in space – triggers war over Taiwan
Chung-chian <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Teng</span> is Dean of the College of International Affairs at National Chengchi University <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Kuo-Hsiung <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Lee</span> is the director of the Natural Products Research Laboratories at UNC Chapel Hill <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">08</span> [“China's Militarization of Space: Motivations and Implications for U.S-Chinese Relations”, NCCU, Chapter 5: U.S. Response, Toward a “Cold War” in Space, pdf]
During the recent Iraq war, 68% of munitions were satellite guided, a massive increase from the merely 10% of satellite guided munitions used in the 1991 Iraq War.199 One senior Air Force officer said that thanks to satellite technology the U.S. no longer fights in the fog of war, but in a “huge cloud of electrons.”200 However, <span style="font-size: 16px;">because four-fifths of America’s military data is transmitted through unhardened commercial satellites, and a single Global Hawk unmanned surveillance drone flying over the middle east can consume several times more bandwidth than was used in the whole of the 1991 war against Iraq, Air Force officers commonly describe space as being America’s “Achilles Heel</span>.”201 Referring to China’s ASAT test, General Hamel of the Air Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center said “//<span style="font-size: 16px;">if they take </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">our asymmetric advantage in space, we go from an information age war machine to an industrial age war machine…shifting the balance, the edge will go to the adversary</span>//.” Many specialists also argue that aside from the U.S. military dependency on orbital space, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. economy, and in turn, much of the world economy, is also rapidly becoming dependent on space-based system</span>s. They posit that, in effect, the U.S. is now a “space faring” nation whose very way of life is tied to the myriad capabilities provided by the orbital space medium.203 War games conducted as part of U.S. national security protocols, such as the Army-After-Next, Navy Global and Air Force Global Engagement series, Space Game 2 and Schriever 1 & 2, as well as the privately conducted “DEADSATS” war games, conducted from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, confirm this view. According to some space experts who were intimately involved with the war games, the exercises exposed “a critical national Achilles heel that politicians, economists and corporate CEOs have largely ignored…<span style="font-size: 16px;">losses in space can quickly affect the economic, social, and national security fabric not only of the united States, but of the entire world</span>.”204 These experts further speculate that “<span style="font-size: 16px;">large military powers,” such as the United States, could “be held hostage by the unknowns inherent in a new kind of war.</span>”205 <span style="font-size: 16px;">These concerns are directly linked with China’s ASAT threat and their potential applicability in any future U.S.-Sino conflict. Clearly any possible U.S. military contingency in the Taiwan Straits would require secure satellites as the U.S. becomes ever more reliant upon its space systems</span>. Moreover, <span style="font-size: 16px;">reconnaissance satellites are thought to limit the risk inherent in the build-up of forces that both the PRC and the U.S. could be expected to deploy to the region in the event of a crisis</span>.206 However, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">if the U.S. was blinded as the result of a preemptive Chinese ASAT attack, the conflict could quickly escalate to a dangerous level</span>//. According to two experts on the subject, “if there is a great- power war in the twenty-first century, our crystal ball says that it will be between the United States and China over Taiwan, with a very serious potential for a horrible escalatory process.”207 This underscores the gravity of the topic as well as the negative impact the Chinese shift towards fielding counter-space weapons could have.



Strong and diverse ISR and Satellite capabilities deter short term China Attack
Chung-chian <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Teng</span> is Dean of the College of International Affairs at National Chengchi University <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Kuo-Hsiung <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Lee</span> is the director of the Natural Products Research Laboratories at UNC Chapel Hill <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">08</span> [“China's Militarization of Space: Motivations and Implications for U.S-Chinese Relations”, NCCU, Chapter Six: Space Militarization: Implications for U.S.-Chinese Relations, pdf]
In many ways <span style="font-size: 16px;">China’s counter-space platforms</span>, such as its already operational directed-energy, ground-based lasers and its direct-ascent, solid-fueled (and therefore rapidly deployable) ASAT missiles that can be launched from any of China’s hundreds of road-mobile, SRBM and MRMB launchers, already <span style="font-size: 16px;">represent a real threat to U.S. forces</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This threat will only grow and ramify with time, perhaps geometrically so, as the PRC continues to grow its young stock of operational</span> Dong Feng-31 (DF-31) road-mobile <span style="font-size: 16px;">ICBMs</span>, which while generally thought to be tipped with 400 kiloton nuclear <span style="font-size: 16px;">warheads</span>,235 <span style="font-size: 16px;">could be modified to attack U.S. national security satellites in GEO</span> with KKVs or future co-orbital killer satellites, EMP weapons and high-powered microwave weapons, all of which are under development. In the interim, General Cartwright’s statement, mentioned previously, that the PRC would be able to destroy all the U.S. reconnaissance satellites in LEO by 2010 appears to be correct.236 According to Desmond Ball, it would require approximately 20 ASAT missiles of the type that destroyed FY-1C last year to destroy 6-7 LEO satellites, which is the number of current U.S. Crystal and Lacrosse space vehicles currently believed to be in orbit. Assuming they passed over or near the PRC, U.S. spy satellites would indeed be vulnerable to China’s ASAT weapons by 2010, as 20 operational, direct-ascent ASAT missiles would presumably be easy enough to field by that time given that the PRC is already mass-producing well over a hundred similar missile platforms a year. All one would need to modify would be the warhead and guidance package, both of which have been already been proven and have been operational as of January 11, 2007.237 The PLA can be expected to continue to develop its ASAT guidance package (which is reportedly radar based and therefore highly vulnerable to jamming) in order to overcome U.S. defense satellites’ built-in counter-measures, which are thought to be quite technologically impressive.238 Therefore the PRC already has an operational ASAT capability, and one that is likely to grow in sophistication and capability. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This will add to the U.S. imperative to counter and deter the Chinese counter-space weapons, and further fuel the U.S.-Sino cold war style build-up in space mentioned previously. In the near-term China is unlikely to be able to compete directly with the U.S., and therefore will continue its asymmetric efforts to exploit the U.S. vulnerability in space.</span> Looking more distantly, <span style="font-size: 16px;">however, one can forecast a situation where China is competing with the U.S. in space</span>(and <span style="font-size: 16px;">on terra firma</span>) as more of a peer-competitor. In such a situation, <span style="font-size: 16px;">whereby there is a relative balance of power and mutual reliance upon orbital space, one could foresee increased stability and something akin to the détente that characterized the later stages of the cold war and led to U.S.-Soviet cooperation in outer space</span>. However, as noted by a recent study, it will be a long time before the PRC can be considered a true peer competitor of the U.S. in space.239 //<span style="font-size: 16px;">In the interim</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">, there is a strong possibility that the relationship between the two powers will be unstable, withpotential global repercussions</span>//. China’s irresponsible actions in space only underscore that growing trend, and point to a disturbing strategic environment in the years ahead. That said, the likely U.S. response to any ASAT attack on an American government satellite, which would be viewed much in the same way that an attack on U.S. terrestrial forces would be (i.e. an act of war), probably rule it out barring a massive miscalculation on the part of the Chinese leadership or a Chinese decision to engage in a Pearl Harbor style sneak attack. The danger lies in the fact that as the PRC’s counter-space capabilities grow and become more subtle with the development of micro-satellites, nano-satellites and other less conspicuous ASAT platforms which could potentially interfere with U.S. satellites without going so far as destroying them, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S.-Sino relationship in space may become more unstable because the potential Chinese menu of options would be increasingly tempting</span>, offering as it would ever more possibilities at a time when the U.S. reliance upon satellites was ever greater. To <span style="font-size: 16px;">offset this scenario</span>, which would mix a dangerous brew of Chinese capabilities with U.S. vulnerabilities in a situation <span style="font-size: 16px;">that could escalate rapidly to general war, the U.S. can be expected to not only diversify and strengthen its orbital assets, but also to develop better air-breathing reconnaissance platforms</span>, such as smaller, stealthier Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV) with longer dwell times in order to have the ability to rapidly restore lost satellite coverage in a crisis. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This U.S. diversification and multiplication of reconnaissance assets would thereby both strengthen the durability of its C4ISR network and force the PRC to plan for more targets, thus making it a less tempting option and creating an environment for better deterrence</span>. Let us now conclude this chapter with a summation and a brief policy suggestion.

US-China War over Taiwan goes nuclear – most likely scenario for conflict
Richard C. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Bush</span>, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and director of its Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND</span> Michael E. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">O'Hanlon</span>, senior fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution, where he specializes in U.S. defense strategy, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">07</span> [“A war like no other: the truth about China's challenge to America”, p. 186, google books]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">If war resulted, escalation pressures would be enormous</span>. It would be the first significant war between nuclear weapons states in world history. And the nuclear arsenals of the two sides could, as unreasonable and illogical as it sounds, come into play. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">Nuclear exchanges</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;"> could even result</span>//. At a time when <span style="font-size: 16px;">the threat of superpower nuclear war has become much less vivid in the public eye</span> due to the end of the Cold War, <span style="font-size: 16px;">a Taiwan crisis could—ironically enough—quickly create </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">the most serious nuclear risk </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">since the Cuban Missile Crisis</span>. The conclusion is not intended to be melodramatic. Even in the event of war, the risk of nuclear conflagration would be be much less than fifty-fifty, since both sides would surely recognize the dangers. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">crises have dynamics all their own</span>. What neither side would see as desirable could nonetheless occur as the fog of war impeded accurate and timely <span style="font-size: 16px;">information flows and clouded leaders’ judgments—and</span> as <span style="font-size: 16px;">the loss of lives raised the stakes to the point where neither Beijing nor Washington could easily back down</span>. In addition, the war plans of the two sides could create momentum of their own. Although details are classified (and always changing in any even), <span style="font-size: 16px;">in the past these war plans apparently have called for hastier escalation than political leaders generally appreciate</span>. This may have changed of late, and certainly recent American commanders in the region have been sensitive to the need to build positive relationships with China and to avoid assuming that conflict would quickly escalate. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">predisposition to restraint may not easily survive direct combat with a major military power; arguments in favor of rapid escalation will be powerful</span>, whether or not the carry the day. Leaders in Taiwan, China, and the United States need to think these issues through thoroughly in advance—for the sake of their war plans, their diplomacy, and their politics. They must figure out how to avoid escalation in any serious crisis or war that beings—for once the three parties get to that point, <span style="font-size: 16px;">avoiding all-out U.S.-China war is more important than other realistic concerns</span>. Indeed, it is so paramount in importance that Taipei, Beijing, and Washington must avoid the temptation to manufacture crises or play politics with the independence of sovereignty issues.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Just as the military and intelligence communities have transformed the way they operate, TSAT will transform the way they communicate</span>. As shown in figure E-12, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">TSAT will provide a dramatic increase in capacity and capability over </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">existing</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and interim </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">satellite</span>////<span style="font-size: 12pt;">communications</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> resources</span>. Depending on circumstances, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">military forces often operate from unimproved and disadvantaged locations world-wide, are highly mobile, and depend heavily on reach-back for near-real time intelligence, imagery, and logistical information as well as inter-unit cooperation and support. </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The greatly expanded use of UAVs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and for direct target engagement has placed extraordinary demands on the current SATCOM system. TSAT will mitigate those demands and further operational flexibility</span>//. The TSAT system is essential to enhancing military and intelligence operations. //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Without TSAT</span>////<span style="font-size: 12pt;">, mobile land forces and Navy ships will lack sufficient assured ISR communications</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> capacity, and the Military and IC will be unable to move and fully benefit from the large and growing quantity of data generated by new airborne and space ISR systems</span>. TSAT exemplifies the promise of the TCA’s enhanced capabilities and is a critical element of the transformation in military and intelligence operations.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some officials have expressed concern that difficulties in mastering the technological intricacies of the signal processor/router may prevent its full development in time for the first scheduled T-Sat</span>launch. But Meink appears optimistic. “<span style="font-size: 12pt;">From a technology standpoint, I think we’re in pretty good shape</span>,” says the program manager. He notes that the <span style="font-size: 12pt;">contractors have considerable experience with similar technology in so-called heritage satellites</span>. “I’m not saying that any of this is easy to do,” Meink asserts. “We still have a lot of work to do, but <span style="font-size: 12pt;">we’re meeting our objectives</span>. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">We’re either on or ahead of schedule on the technologies. We’ve had a number of demonstrations in the lasercom and processor/router areas</span>. The contractors are meeting what they set out to do.” <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Risk reduction has very high priority in the T-Sat design/development phase. Meink says the T-Sat program was carefully configured from the beginning to avoid the problems of hasty and haphazard structuring</span> that have plagued some other space programs in recent years. “<span style="font-size: 12pt;">We’ve taken more time than normal in the early part of the program to make sure that we’ve gotten this right, to ensure that the technology has matured to a higher level than usual in going into development</span>,” he says.

Clay <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wilson</span>, Specialist in Technology and National Security Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">07</span> [“Network Centric Operations: Background and Oversight Issues for Congress”, CRS report for Congress, march 15, pdf, mcG]
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">NCO is highly dependent on the interoperability of communications equipment, data, and software to enable networking of people, sensors, and manned and unmanned platforms</span>. Parts of NCO technology rely on lineof-sight radio transmission for microwave or infrared signals, or laser beams. Other parts of the technology aggregate information for transmission through larger network trunks for global distribution via fiber optic cables, microwave towers, or both lowaltitude and high-altitude satellites. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The designs for this technology must enable rapid communications between individuals in all services, and rapid sharing of data and information between mobile platforms and sensors used by all military services</span>.60 The <span style="font-size: 12pt;">architectures must also have the ability to dynamically self-heal and re-form the network when one or more communications nodes are interrupted. DOD officials have noted that the new military Global Information Grid (GIG) must be also designed to interoperate securely with the networks of other organizations outside of DOD</span>, including state and local governments, multinational military commands, and the commercial and research communities.61<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some observers question whether the U.S. military can achieve true network and systems interoperability among all services. DOD reportedly intends to integrate the architectures of network systems used by all branches of the military to create a network centric capability linked to the GIG</span>(seesectionbelow). Tohelpaccomplish this integration, the <span style="font-size: 12pt;">DOD Joint Staff has created a new Force Capability Board (FCB) to monitor NCO programs for mismatches in funding, or mismatches in capability</span>. When an issue is detected, the FCB reports to the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, which then provides guidance during budget deliberations at the Pentagon.62

TSAT is the only system that works – AEHF and WGS Fail

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">With TSAT, everything changes. While WGS and AEHF are evolutionary gains in capability and capacity, TSAT is truly transformation. Certainly, TSAT is more of the same in some respects; </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">TSAT will offer a tenfold increase in capacity over AEHF</span>//. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">However, when you consider IP routing in space, the incredible gains as the result of laser communications, the efficiency delivered through dynamic bandwidth allocation (you get the bandwidth you need, when you need it) and T1 (1.544 Mbs) date rates for protected comm-on-the-move users with small diameter antennas, </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">TSAT will change the way we fight, coordinate, collaborate, maneuve</span>////<span style="font-size: 12pt;">r</span>//—I could go on and on. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">TSAT will move more data, more protected data, to more users, while on the move.

As planned, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the T-Sat operational constellation will consist of five highly advanced communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit. A sixth T-Sat will be deployed as an inactive spare in the event of attrition</span>. Each <span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat will provide</span> both laser communications (<span style="font-size: 12pt;">lasercom) and</span> advanced <span style="font-size: 12pt;">radio frequency</span>(RF) communications, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">with crosslinks to other space platforms and downlinks to airborne, land-based, and sea-based platforms.</span> Each <span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat will also embody the so-called next-generation signal processor/router (NGPR) for ultra-high-speed prioritization</span> and distribution of communications. These innovative features will enable the TSat system to disseminate a wealth of information through and from space in rapid-fire fashion, at exceedingly high data rates, to military and national intelligence users, in fixed positions or on the move, anywhere in the world. T<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sats are designed to withstand jamming and other disruptive or destructive antisatellite countermeasures</span>. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are competing for the contract to produce the T-Sats in an acquisition program that will cost an estimated $16 billion. In January 2004, the Air Force awarded each company a contract of about $500 million to carry out the design and risk-reduction phase of T-Sat development. The service will select the winner in late FY06. First launch of a <span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat is planned for</span>the <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2013</span>-2015 time frame. Full operational capability of the T-Sat constellation is scheduled for 2018.
TSAT meets requirements – Transformational COM study proves

The <span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat system is the heart of the Pentagon’s transformational communications architecture</span> <span style="font-size: 9.5pt;">(TCA), </span>devised by defense scientists in 2004 under the direction of Peter Teets, former undersecretary of the Air Force. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The TCA resulted from the transformational communications study (TCS) undertaken by the Defense Dept</span>. in 2002. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The architecture addresses, among other things, wideband space-to-space and space-tohigh-altitude airborne communications using a common standard for laser communication; communications and relay satellites; ground terminals; operational management systems; and communications interfaces. </span>The <span style="font-size: 9.5pt;">TCA </span>makes sure that new, transformational satcom systems will be able to connect with existing, or legacy, systems in space. The Air Force-managed T-Sat/<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;">T-MOS </span>system is being developed to do just that. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Meink explains that T-Sat will be “the means of removing communications constraints in terms of capacity, control, adaptability, responsiveness, and coverage</span>,” <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and of meeting global U.S. requirements for communications across the defense, intelligence, and civil communities</span>, including <span style="font-size: 9.5pt;">NASA</span>. “<span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat would be a key enabler of our forces whether or not they go to this idealized net-centric warfare,”</span> Meink says. “T-Sat would be critical to what our forces are capable of doing right now, not just to what they’ll be capable of doing in the future. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">We’re trying to do as much as we can with what we have right now.” The key to T-Sat’s transformational capability lies in its packet-routed, rather than circuit-switched, communications, </span>the program director notes. He explains that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">packet-routing will result in “dynamic, seamless, full-mesh connectivity—connecting anyone to everyone” using the GIG</span>, whereas circuit-switching is relatively static, and affords only point-to-point or multipoint connectivity

Commercial aerospace fails – oversight is key – Aerospace effective
Robert H. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Trice</span>, PhD Poli Sci, prof poli sci, member of the Council on Foreign Relations and past Chairman of the International Council of the Aerospace Industries Association, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">11</span> [“Modestly-Sized Aerospace & Defense Sector Is Major National Asset”, March 10, Essay, pdf]
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">One reason A&D companies are sometimes charged with being costly, cumbersome, risk averse and bureaucratic is that they mirror their primary customers</span>. And, inevitably, the <span style="font-size: 12pt;">periodic attempts to make the process more economical and “commercial-like” fail because this government marketplace is the antithesis of a commercial one</span>. Commercial businesses work in generally open markets, dealing directly with multiple customers empowered to make buying decisions through individual transactions, and with growth largely constrained by anti-trust laws. A<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&D companies are largely dealing with a single customer set comprised of multiple, competing political constituencies, with growth and size limits often set by industrial base considerations.</span> Commercial firms work to a price-based, closed book business model. The market determines what consumers will pay for a particular widget, irrespective of what it costs to make it. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">A&D companies work to a cost-based, open book business model</span>. Cost and price negotiations are governed by the Truth in Negotiation Act (TINA) and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) that lay out every element of contractor cost to be analyzed. To ensure A&D companies are fulfilling their DOD contractual obligations, in 2009 the Defense Contracting Auditing Agency (DCAA) employed 4,000 people with a budget of $433M, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) had 10,000 civilians with a budget of over $1B, and the Office of the Inspector General had 1,475 auditors and a budget of $288M. In addition, there are military service acquisition and program management offices for every program, the Office of the Secretary of Defense acquisition community and Congress’ auditing arm, the General Accountability Office (GAO). The Department of Defense has stated that it will further increase oversight by hiring 20,000 more acquisition professionals, at a time of flattening acquisition budgets. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">A&D companies have to staff their program management, finance, contracts and internal audit functions to service these legally mandated government requirements. Unless a commercial company really messes up</span> (Enron, AIG, BP, Lehman Brothers), <span style="font-size: 12pt;">it is likely to face limited government oversight. By the very nature of its work, an A&D company lives with significant oversight every day.</span> A commercial company faces very limited controls over most exports; defense exports, quite rightly, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">are by far the most highly regulated of any industrial sector</span>. Each step along the way to a foreign sale of U.S. defense equipment requires its own State Department export license, and each proposed sale over $50M is subject to Congressional review. As of 2010, there are literally tens of thousands of active licenses that govern how A&D companies approach the international marketplace. And finally, a commercial company’s product life cycles are largely driven by consumer demand. Some products go gang-busters for years while others simply go bust. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">For A&D companies, program life cycles are driven by the vagaries of annual budgeting and appropriations processes, changing threats, requirements, and philosophies, program performance and, in some cases, political whims. The business consequences can occasionally be surreal, and the military impacts consequential.</span>

===Contention 1: Leadership=== 

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">In the 21st century, unipolarity will destroy US legitimacy – US can’t deter conflict if the liberal order collapses</span>

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Maher</span>**, Ph.D. in pol sci,** <span style="font-size: 13pt;">11</span> – Richard Maher, Ph.D. in Political Science from Brown University, Winter 2011, “The Paradox of American Unipolarity: Why the United States May Be Better Off in a Post-Unipolar World,” Orbis, Vol. 55, No. 1, p. 53-68


Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, world politics has been unipolar, defined by American preponderance in each of the core components of state power—military, economic, and technological. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Such an imbalanced distribution of power in favor of a single country is unprecedented in the modern state system. This material advantage does not automatically translate into America’s preferred political and diplomatic outcomes</span>, however. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Other states, if now only at the margins, are challenging U.S. power and authority</span>. Additionally, on a range of issues, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the United States is finding it increasingly difficult to realize its goals and ambitions</span>. The even bigger challenge for policymakers in Washington is how to respond to signs that America’s unquestioned preeminence in international politics is waning. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">This decline in the United States’ relative position is in part a consequence of the burdens and susceptibilities produced by unipolarity</span>. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the U.S. position both internationally and domestically may actually be strengthened once this period of unipolarity has passed</span>. On pure material terms, the gap between the United States and the rest of the world is indeed vast. The U.S. economy, with a GDP of over $14 trillion, is nearly three times the size of China’s, now the world’s second-largest national economy. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The United States today accounts for approximately 25 percent of global economic output, a figure that has held relatively stable despite steadily increasing economic growth in China, India, Brazil, and other countries</span>. Among the group of six or seven great powers, this figure approaches 50 percent. When one takes discretionary spending into account, the United States today spends more on its military than the rest of the world combined. This imbalance is even further magnified by the fact that five of the next seven biggest spenders are close U.S. allies. China, the country often seen as America’s next great geopolitical rival, has a defense budget that is one-seventh of what the United States spends on its military. There is also a vast gap in terms of the reach and sophistication of advanced weapons systems. By some measures, the United States spends more on research and development for its military than the rest of the world combined. What is remarkable is that the United States can do all of this without completely breaking the bank. Th<span style="font-size: 12pt;">e United States today devotes approximately 4 percent of GDP to defense. As a percentage of GDP, the United States today spends far less on its military than it did during the Cold War,</span> when defense spending hovered around 10 percent of gross economic output. As one would expect, the United States today enjoys unquestioned preeminence in the military realm. No other state comes close to having the capability to project military power like the United States.1 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">And yet, despite this material preeminence, the United States sees its political and strategic influence diminishing around the world</span>. It is involved in two costly and destructive wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, where success has been elusive and the end remains out of sight. China has adopted a new assertiveness recently, on everything from U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, currency convertibility, and America’s growing debt (which China largely finances). Pakistan, one of America’s closest strategic allies, is facing the threat of social and political collapse. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Russia is using its vast energy resources to reassert its dominance in what it views as its historical sphere of influence</span>. Negotiations with North Korea and Iran have gone nowhere in dismantling their nuclear programs. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Brazil’s growing economic and political influence offer another option for partnership and investment for countries in the Western Hemisphere. And relations with Japan, following the election that brought the opposition Democratic Party into power, are at their frostiest in decades. To many observers, it seems that </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">America’s vast power is not translating into America’s preferred outcomes. </span>//As the United States has come to learn, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">raw power does not automatically translate into the realization of one’s preferences, nor is it necessarily easy to maintain one’s predominant position in world politics. There are many costs that come with predominance – material, political, and reputational</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Vast imbalances of power create apprehension and anxiety in others, in one’s friends just as much as in one’s rivals.</span>// In this view, it is not necessarily //American// predominance that produces unease but rather American //predominance//. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Predominance also makes one a tempting target, and a scapegoat for other countries’ own problems and unrealized ambitions</span>. Many a Third World autocrat has blamed his country’s economic and social woes on an ostensible U.S. conspiracy to keep the country fractured, underdeveloped, and subservient to America’s own interests. Predominant power likewise breeds envy, resentment, and alienation. How is it possible for one country to be so rich and powerful when so many others are weak, divided, and poor? //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Legitimacy—the perception that one’s role and purpose is acceptable and one’s power is used justly—is indispensable for maintaining power and influence in world politics. </span>//As we witness the emergence (or re-emergence) of great powers in other parts of the world, we realize that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">American predominance cannot last forever. It is inevitable that the distribution of power and influence will become more balanced in the future</span>, and that the United States will necessarily see its relative power decline. W<span style="font-size: 12pt;">hile the United States naturally should avoid hastening the end of this current period of American predominance, it should not look upon the next period of global politics and international history with dread or foreboding. </span>It certainly should not seek to maintain its predominance at any cost, devoting unlimited ambition, resources, and prestige to the cause. In fact, contrary to what many have argued about the importance of maintaining its predominance, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">America’s position in the world—both at home and internationally—could very well be strengthened once its era of preeminence is over. It is, therefore, necessary for the United States to start thinking about how best to position itself in the ‘‘post-unipolar’’ world.</span>


<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Effective US leadership is necessary to solve all future scenarios for conflict – Russia and China are key game players who the US must get on board in global politics</span>

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Larson</span>, pol sci prof, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">10</span>—Larson & Shevchenko 10 – Deborah Welch Larson, Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Alexei Shevchenko, Assistant Professor of Political Science at California State University, Fullerton, Spring 2010, “Status Seekers: Chinese and Russian Responses to U.S. Primacy,” International Security, Vol. 34, No. 4, p. 63-95

Since the end of the Cold War, scholars and foreign policy analysts have debated the type of world order that the United States should strive to create—a hegemonic system, a multilateral institutional system, or a great power concert.1 Initially, a major issue was whether attempts to maintain U.S. primacy would stimulate counterbalancing from other states.2 But since the 2003 Iraq War, a new consideration has emerged—how to persuade other states to cooperate with U.S. global governance. 3 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">States that do not oppose efforts by the United States to maintain stability may nonetheless decline to follow its leadership</span>. This is a matter for concern because <span style="font-size: 12pt;">although the United States can act alone, it cannot succeed on such issues as controlling terrorism, curbing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), rebuilding failed states, or maintaining economic stability without help from other states.</span> Among the states whose support is critical are China and Russia. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">China, which in modern times has never been accorded great power status, has experienced impressive economic growth and is rapidly rising in the international system. China’s ascendance creates expectations</span> of an uncertain power transition in the Asia-Pacific region and potentially in world politics, one <span style="font-size: 12pt;">that could be accompanied by dangerous competition. Then there is Russia, a former superpower</span> and (after a decade of post-Soviet retrenchment complicated by gross internal mismanagement) most recently a resurgent power because of a rise in energy prices, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">a power that has not yet found a place in world politics</span>. Obtaining cooperation from China and Russia is more complex and difficult because they are outsiders from the liberal Western community, with differing values and interests.4 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">In contrast, as a long-standing democracy, rising power India is more susceptible to appeals to common values</span>, especially since the 2006 nuclear agreement with the United States recognized India’s status as a nuclear power.5 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">With China and Russia, the problem is how to obtain their cooperation with U.S. global governance if they cannot be integrated into the West.</span> The <span style="font-size: 12pt;">United States needs Chinese and Russian assistance to curb proliferation of WMD, control terrorism, maintain stable energy supplies, and stabilize Eurasia</span>. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">China and Russia have permanent seats on the United Nations (UN) Security Council, allowing them to veto resolutions authorizing intervention or sanctions against would-be proliferators or aggressors</span>. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">China and Russia also have political ties with Iran and North Korea</span> that could make them useful intermediaries. Because of its economic aid and geographic proximity, China is an essential interlocutor with North Korea; Russia is a major arms supplier and economic partner with Iran. Russia has thousands of nuclear weapons and tons of nuclear materials, both coveted by rogue states and terrorist groups. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">As the second-largest oil exporter and the holder of the world’s largest gas reserves, Russia can affect global energy supplies and prices. Russia could provide help as a transit route for U.S. military supplies and source of intelligence for the U.S. effort to stabilize Afghanistan</span>. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">As the dominant power in Central Asia, Russia can assist in maintaining stability in this energy-rich region, an area that is increasingly important to China as well. The United States needs to work with China to stabilize security relationships in the Asia-Pacific region, head off regional rivalries, and prevent dangerous conºict resulting from a North Korean implosion</span>. Scholars have debated whether future Chinese and Russian foreign policies will contribute to global stability.6 Both states have been reluctant to agree to tough sanctions on North Korea and Iran to stop their nuclear programs.7 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">As China’s consumption of energy has grown, Beijing has been actively competing for control of energy resources around the world</span>, sometimes in rogue states such as Burma, Iran, and Sudan.8 China has used the growing wealth of its economy to modernize its military, increasing its ability to coerce Taiwan or seize disputed territory in the East and South China Seas.9 Russia has been trying to exert influence over the post-Soviet space by such means as cutting off the supply of oil and gas,10 and most dramatically, its August 2008 incursion into Georgia followed by recognition of the breakaway republics Abkhazia and South Ossetia.11 Both China and Russia have sold arms to objectionable regimes such as Burma, Iran, Syria, and Venezuela.12 Securing Chinese and Russian cooperation requires understanding the objectives and logic of their grand strategies and devising effective policies to achieve that goal. In what follows, we demonstrate that despite apparent shifts and turns, Chinese and Russian foreign policies since the end of the Cold War have been motivated by a consistent objective—to restore both countries’ great power status. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">We argue that China and Russia will be more likely to participate in global governance if the United States can find ways to recognize their distinctive status and identities. States’ concerns about their relative status have been largely overlooked by</span> the dominant theoretical approaches of <span style="font-size: 12pt;">neorealism and liberalism</span>.13 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Neorealism focuses on material components of power, whereas liberalism is oriented around norms, institutions, and economic interdependence. These approaches have limited utility for persuading China and Russia to cooperate because neither country needs economic or security assistance from the West,</span> and they do not subscribe to Western liberal democratic norms. For insights into the role of status in international politics, we draw on social identity theory (SIT), which explores how social groups strive to achieve a positively distinctive identity.14 When a group’s identity is no longer favorable, it may pursue one of several strategies: social mobility, social competition, or social creativity. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Social mobility emulates the values and practices of the higher-status group with the goal of gaining admission into elite clubs. Social competition tries to equal or surpass the dominant group in the area on which its claims to superior status rest. Finally, social creativity reframes a negative attribute as positive or stresses achievement in a different domain</span>. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Applied to international relations, SIT suggests that states may improve their status by joining elite clubs, trying to best the dominant states, or achieving preeminence outside the arena of geopolitical competition</span>.15 We apply a theoretical framework based on SIT to case studies of changes in Chinese and Russian grand strategy since the end of the Cold War as a plausibility probe.16 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our study indicates that China and Russia initially sought great power status through partial acceptance of Western capitalist norms but were denied integration</span> into elite-Western clubs. Both states turned to more competitive policies but did not enhance their relative standing. Rather than adjust to the U.S.-led liberal democratic system, China and Russia sought to develop new, more positive images by contributing to global governance while maintaining distinctive identities. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">China has been remarkably successful in changing other states’ perceptions of its identity, whereas Russia’s cooperation was largely taken for granted.</span> Russia’s foreign policy is currently in a transitional phase with some elements of social competition. Our case studies suggest that the desire for greater status may motivate rising powers to take on more responsibility for maintaining world order. For this outcome to occur, the dominant power, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the United States, must offer recognition of the rising state’s more positive identity and status. Overall U.S. predominance allows the United States to recognize other countries’ achievements and contributions in the area of global governance without detracting from its own status.</span> Use of status incentives should receive greater consideration as a tool of global governance. We begin by discussing the basic propositions of SIT, showing why groups are motivated to achieve positive distinctiveness. We then elaborate and conceptualize the SIT typology of identity management strategies, providing applications to international relations. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">This theoretical framework is then used to explain major shifts in Chinese and Russian grand strategy since the end of the Cold War, and especially the adoption of more cooperative policies</span>. The conclusion identifies contributions of SIT to understanding otherwise puzzling Chinese and Russian behavior.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is a reason that</span> regimes like <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Iran and North Korea</span> go to the time and expense, and assume the risks of <span style="font-size: 12pt;">developing nuclear weapons</span> programs; nuclear capability empowers them to achieve their ends, and thereby <span style="font-size: 12pt;">poses challenges to the </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">U</span>//nited //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">S</span>//tates, for several reasons. First, there is a danger that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">rogue regimes</span> with nuclear material <span style="font-size: 12pt;">may assist terrorists in developing</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">w</span>////<span style="font-size: 12pt;">eapons of mass destruction</span>//.[36] Even the possibility that such regimes may do so gives them leverage internationally. Second, these regimes have ambitions in their regions and around the world.[37] <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some of their leaders are </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">fanatical enough to actually consider a first strike using nuclear weapons</span>//; for example, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">high-ranking officials of</span> the <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Iran</span>ian government <span style="font-size: 12pt;">have openly discussed using a nuclear weapon against Israel</span>.[38] Whether a first strike occurs or not, the possession of nuclear capability frees aggressive regimes to pursue their other goals violently with less fear of retaliation. For example, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">North Korea’s nuclear capability means that it could </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">attack South</span>////<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Korea</span>// conventionally with a measure of impunity; even if the attack failed, the United States and its allies would be less likely to remove the North Korean regime in retaliation. In other words, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">nuclear capability lessens the penalties</span> which could be exacted on North Korea if it engages in aggression, //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">which makes the aggression more likely</span>//. The same logic applies to Iran, which is why the other nations in the Middle East are so concerned about Iran’s nuclear program. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">A nuclear attack by Iran is possible</span>, but the real danger of <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Iranian nuclear capability</span> is that it <span style="font-size: 12pt;">would make </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">conventional aggression in the region more likely</span>//.[39] Finally, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the more nations that get nuclear weapons, </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">the</span>////<span style="font-size: 12pt;">greater the pressure on other nations to acquire them</span>// as a deterrent, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and this is particularly true when a government</span> acquiring the capability <span style="font-size: 12pt;">is seen as </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">unstable </span>////<span style="font-size: 12pt;">oraggressive</span>//.

Political instability in Afghanistan would spillover, collapsing Pakistan and risks an all out nuclear war over power vacuum in Kabul

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Grant, </span>Governance, Strategy & Terrorism Section Director at The Henry Jackson Society,<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> 10</span> [George Grant is the Governance, Strategy & Terrorism Section Director at The Henry Jackson Society, the author of a number of briefing papers with relevance in this field, including an analysis of the political, economic and philosophical drivers of radical Islamism in the Muslim World as well as a report on China’s rise in Africa, and what it means for the continent’s democratic and economic prospects, Masters Degrees in History, “Succeeding in Afghanistan,” Henry Jackson Society: Project for Democratic Geopolitics is a crosspartisan, British think-tank, 2010, [[http://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com/documents/Succeeding_in_Afghanistan.pdf]]]

In addition to <span style="font-size: 11pt;">increasing the risk to Western national security</span>, failure in Afghanistan <span style="font-size: 11pt;">would also generate the possibility of widespread regional instability.The country</span> likely to be most severely affected <span style="font-size: 11pt;">would be neighbouring, nuclear-armed Pakistan</span>, and this is the principal reason why the government in Islamabad has finally started to take the threat posed by the Taliban seriously. Not only would t<span style="font-size: 11pt;">he Pakistan-Taliban be rejuvenated psychologically, the material and logistical assistance that they would receive from across the border could seriously enhance the threat they pose to the Pakistani government.</span> For all the focus on Afghanistan, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the threat posed to Pakistan by insurgents is not one to be underestimated</span>. It is worth recalling the events of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">April 2009</span>, when a resurgent <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Taliban advanced to within just 60 miles of Islamabad, prompting very real concerns of a Taliban takeover of the country and its nuclear arsenal</span>.110 It is also worth recalling that what precipitated this resurgence was the capitulation of the Pakistani government in the Swat Valley, granting carte blanche to the Taliban to exercise administrative and judicial control, thus placing even more territory in the hands of the Taliban, having already lost control of most of its tribal agencies bordering Afghanistan. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">To cede control of Afghanistan to the Taliban, even in just those regions bordering Pakistan, could result in a rejuvenation of the insurgency across the border which would, in the worst case scenario, pose an existential threat to Pakistan, and the seemingly fantastical but nonetheless real possibility of its nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of the Taliban</span>. The consequences of this scenario would be dire indeed. The absolutely <span style="font-size: 11pt;">unacceptable prospect of the Taliban gaining control of a nuclear arsenal would surely precipitate a massive incursion by Western countries or by India, with the potential to throw not only Pakistan, but the entire region into massive conflict.</span> This is, however, the worst-case scenario and one that is unlikely to come to pass, though it is by no means impossible. More likely is that Pakistan would be able to withstand a renewed insurgency, but the fallout in terms of civilian deaths, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">displacement and further instability would nonetheless be severe</span>. The wider <span style="font-size: 11pt;">potential for instability in the region would come from the power struggle that would ensue amongst regional actors to ensure that a regime amenable to their own ambitions emerged in Kabul,</span> or at least to prevent the emergence of a hostile regime. It is no secret that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the rationale behind Pakistan’s support for the Taliban during the 1990s was the perceived necessity of countering the influence of India in the country,</span> which was lending its support to non-Taliban elements, principally the Northern Alliance.111 In the wake of the 2001 invasion India was quick to lend serious diplomatic and economic assistance to the new government in Kabul. Several thousand Indians are involved in over a billion dollars worth of development projects in Afghanistan, from road-building, to sanitation projects, to the digging of wells, to the erection of power transmission lines and more besides. India is even constructing the country’s new parliament building.112 The ability of India, with an economy more than six times the size of Pakistan, to overshadow the latter’s own assistance efforts has already set alarm bells ringing in Islamabad. “Who is the beneficiary of this war on terror that requires the collaboration of Pakistan?” a retired Pakistani officer was recently quoted as asking. “India is again in Afghanistan, working against us.”113 <span style="font-size: 11pt;">In the event of a collapse of authority in Afghanistan this power- struggle would only escalate as not only India and Pakistan sought to fill the vacuum, but potentially other regional actors, including Iran and Russia</span>.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It appears that the success or failure of any U.S. or international effort to secure Pakistan’s nuclear weapons will rely, to a high degree, on how well America’s “spies”, and those of cooperating states, have been able to infiltrate Pakistan’s jihadist groups, and on the friendships that military officers, U.S. and British in particular, have been able to form over the years with their Loyalist Pakistani counterparts. But even </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">assuming that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons can be located</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">there isstil</span>l <span style="font-size: 8pt;">significant </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">uncertainty as to whether they can be disabled or secured.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Even if intelligence correctly pinpoints the location of the nuclear weapons storage sites controlled by Islamist Pakistani Army units</span>, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the United States still confronts several problems in seizing</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or de- stroying </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">these weapons</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">First</span>, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">any air strike or insertion of ground forces would likelyrequire surprise</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to succeed</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Forewarned, the Islamists would likely reposition the weapons or, even worse, try to use them</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">If surprise were achieved, however. U.S. and other military observers believe another problem must be addressed: </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the weapons are likely stored in deep underground chambers, impervious to</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">destruction by even the most powerful American “bunker buster" </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">precision-guided munitions</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">sometimes referred to as “smart bombs.” There have been reports that the U.S. government has developed very low-yield, highly accurate “pre- cision” earth-penetrating nuclear weapons in anticipation of this prob- lem." However, it is doubtful that any U.S. president would authorize the first use of American nuclear weapons, even under these circumstances. Finally;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> it might be necessary to destroy or neutralize all of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons</span> (<span style="font-size: 8pt;">or at least those not given to the Jihadists simultaneously</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">TheIslamist army elements would have great incentive to em- ploy at least some of the weapons that survived any U.S. strike</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">lest they be lost in any follow-on attacks. The likely targets of Islamist nuclear ret- rihution strikes would be Pakistani Loyalist forces, India, and U.S. forces in neighboring Afghanistan</span>. If Loyalist units are hit, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the temptation on their part to retaliate in kind against Islamist forces or jihadist strong- holds may be irresistible. Should lndia be attacked. a full-scale nuclear exchange involving dozens. and perhaps hundreds, of warheads may ensue.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are indications that </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">New Delhi would retaliate with scores of nuclear weapons to ensure it destroyed every Pakistani nuclear weapon.</span>" <span style="font-size: 8pt;">While U.S. air and missile defenses now positioned in the area may be able to intercept some Pakistani nuclear weapons launched against India. there are no guarantees that they will he able to intercept every aircraft or missile. It is, of course, possible that the attacks may be mounted employing nontraditional means (e.g., hy smuggling a weapon across the Indian border, employing a small commercial aircraft on a “kaniikaze” strike, or trucking one into a Loyalist arm). Simply put, there is no shortage of risks involved in taking action, as military plan- ners readily concede. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">lf the United States attempts to take out Pakistan‘s nuclear forces and fails to eliminate them all. Washington may he blamed for acting but not succeeding, even though doing nothing may be the worst option of all</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Again we come back to the critical importance of having detailed intelligence regarding the location of Pakistan weapons and the ability to strike quickly and effectively. The challenges associated with securing the nuclear weapons trans- ferred to the jihadists are no less formidable, even assuming the U.S. military can identify where the weapons are located. If the weapons are held by a small group of jihadists, and if their location can be precisely defined, and if the location is in a sparsely populated area, the clandestine insertion of elite U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOP) troops would he one possible means ol' securing the weapons, particularly il' they are inserted immediately following an air strike that kills or clisperses the ji- hadists. But this option relies for its success on an uncomfortable number of “ifs." In any event, a combined air-SOF strike may prove difficult to pull off. Although their development has long been discussed</span>, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">another problem confronting the U.S. military is its lack of long-range stealthy SOF aircraft, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">both planes and helicopters, to move these forces over the great distances that will be required to penetrate deep into Pakistan, while also avoiding detection. Equally worrisome is how the captured nuclear weapon and the U.S. troops guarding it will be evacuated. It is unlikely that the aircraft that transport the Special Forms will be able to land in Pakistan. let alone refuel there.” Yet another concern is that if the weapons are found to he in a densely populated area, a much larger force will he required to seize them, reducing the chances for surprise while greatly increasing the possibility of civilian casualties. lt would take days to organize and transport such a large force. Military commanders thus confront the problem of time. Once intelligence reports the suspected location of a weapon, the clock is ticking. If the Jihadists are smart, and one must assume they are, they are likely moving their weapons on a regular basis. The longer it takes to organize and deploy a search team and the associated forces, the greater the chance that they will arrive to find-nothing. This planning factor is critical for U.S. commanders. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The military has only a small number of Special Forces and even less in the way of air transportation assets</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It cannot afford at failed snatch mission. A just-published article in Janes Defence Weekly states that the entire U.S. military has sufficient assets to con- duct at most two or three of these snatch raids simultaneously.“ Thus the intelligence must he of the highest grade, U.S. forces must operate with the greatest speed, and the operations must he superbly coordi- nated. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Once the jihadists realize that the snatch operations are under way, their incentive to use these weapons, rather than have them seized, will likely increase dramatically.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">US hegemonic ambition runs counter to the realities of a globalizing world. It openly contradicts the concept of sovereignty</span> in today's world and is in conflict with the principles of free information, open borders, and more integrated trade and financing. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">It</span> also <span style="font-size: 12pt;">ignores our common vulnerability to threats-ranging from terrorism and weapons of mass destruction to environmental degradation and the spread of diseases-which require close cooperation among all members of the international community, including both state and nonstate actors</span>. The multitude of open interactions among state and nonstate entities within and across national boundaries indicates the emergence of a global civil society, which in turn will call increasingly for global accountability. Thus, domestic constituencies should not be the exclusive focus of responsible national governments. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The emerging world public opinion</span>, facilitated by improved communication technologies and greater circulation of information, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">appreciates the interdependence of domestic and foreign politie</span>s, which greatly constrains national governments. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">World public opinion is weighing more and more in domestic decision-making processes-a trend that the US administration tends to underestimate</span>. The new initiative recently undertaken by the US State Department to better inform the global community of US policies is a belated but welcome recognition of the need for global accountability. However, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">a careful analysis of global trends would indicate that resentment of US policy across the world does not emanate solely from lack of information or misperceptions about US policies. Rather, it represents the serious apprehension of well-informed people both outside and within the United States about the rising unilateral tendencies of the Bush administration.</span>

America is declining, but not at a disastrous rate, controlling the information age is essential to peacefully deal with the rise of the rest – failure means we don’t shift to multipolarity

This, in turn, </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">will require a deeper understanding of power, how it is changing, and how to construct “smart power” strategies that combine hard- and soft-power resources in an information age</span>//. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The country’s capacity to maintain alliances and create networks will be an important dimension of its hard and soft power</span>. Power is not good or bad per se. It is like calories in a diet: more is not always better. If a country has too few power resources, it is less likely to obtain its preferred outcomes, but too much power (in terms of resources) has often proved to be a curse when it leads to overconfidence and inappropriate strategies. Davide Slew goliath because Goliath’s superior power resources led him to pursue an inferior strategy, which in turn led to he defeat and death. A smart-power narrative for //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">the twenty-first century is not about maximizing power or preserving hegemony.

Other countries are pursuing information sharing – US needs to act now to compete for and secure influence in the information age

John J. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Garstka</span>, assistant director for concepts and operations in the Office of Force Transformation, Office of the Secretary of Defense. He has spoken and written extensively on the topic of warfare in the information age, 20<span style="font-size: 13pt;">03</span> [“Network-Centric Warfare Offers Warfighting Advantage”, Signal Online, May, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=235&zoneid=62]]</span>, mcG]

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Datalinks are the new weapon of the information age</span>. The term network-centric warfare broadly describes the combination of emerging tactics, techniques and procedures that a networked force can employ to create a decisive warfighting advantage. According to John Keegan, author of A History of Warfare, it is similar to the significant warfighting developments of the industrial age and agrarian age in that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">network-centric warfare seeks to exploit an order of magnitude change in an underlying source of power to increase warfighting advantage dramatically.</span> Paula Kaufman, in an article she wrote for IEEE Spectrum, agrees with this opinion<span style="font-size: 12pt;">. In the industrial age, power was primarily derived from mass and the sources of power for moving mass. In the information age, power is increasingly derived from information sharing, information access and speed,</span> she says. The advantages network-centric warfare brings to the battlespace are particularly relevant to the tactical and operational levels of war, but they impact all levels of military activity from the tactical to the strategic. Although <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the construct of an information advantage may seem somewhat intangible, it can be measured, and its impact on military operations can be evaluated in terms of mission effectiveness, survivability and lethality</span>—coins of the realm used by warfighters across the ages. Evidence of the power of network-centric warfare accumulated from a wide range of activities, including combat operations, training events, exercises and demonstrations, continues to strengthen and reinforce its existing tenets. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">A U.S. Defense Department 2001 report to Congress about network-centric warfare enumerates several specific points: A robustly networked force improves information sharing; information sharing and collaboration enhances the quality of information and shared situational awareness; shared situational awareness enables collaboration and self-synchronization and enhances sustainability and speed of command; and these in turn dramatically increase mission effectiveness. </span>Although the margin of victory has varied across mission areas, the outcome has consistently been decisive in favor of forces that are robustly networked. In some tactical engagements, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">superior platforms were decisively defeated by less capable platforms that leveraged the order of magnitude improvement in information sharing that networking enables.</span> In other engagements, digitized and networked ground forces with a reduced number of platforms were able to substitute information for mass and outperform units that had fought with a larger number of platforms not similarly digitized and networked. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Even more impressive, the combination of networked and digitized ground and air forces was able to defeat an opposition force decisively with unprecedented lethality by creating and leveraging an information advantage</span>. Most recently, military operations in support of operation Enduring Freedom highlighted the emergence of near-real-time information sharing as a source of warfighting advantage. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The source of power was not new platforms, but rather the networking of the legacy platforms with special operations forces</span> (SOF). The extent to which ground-based SOF were able to share precision information with command and control aircraft and fighter, bomber and attack aircraft was unprecedented in military operations. It represented an order of magnitude increase in information sharing over what had been previously demonstrated anywhere in the world in combat operations. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Two of the more noteworthy and documented examples of the power of network-centric warfare are drawn from the air-to-air mission. In this mission area, a major contributor to enhanced survivability and lethality is an increase in shared situational awareness</span> and enhanced situational understanding. With audio-only communications, p<span style="font-size: 12pt;">ilots and controllers must share information</span> generated by onboard sensors about opposing forces as well as their own position and status via voice. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Communicating the minimum essential information required to take offensive or defensive actions takes time, and the resulting situational awareness can often differ significantly from reality</span>. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">In contrast, when datalinks are employed on fighter aircraft, digital information on blue and red forces is shared instantaneously, enabling all participants to share a common tactical picture. This improved information position constitutes a significant information advantage vis-à-vis an adversary fighting with voice-only communications. This information advantage in turn enables a cognitive advantage in the form of dramatically increased shared situational awareness and enhanced situational understanding. The result is that pilots flying datalink-equipped aircraft can achieve much higher levels of shared situational awareness and understanding on a timeline previously unachievable with voice-only communications. They can translate these advantages into increased survivability and lethality. One of the best examples of how networking and digitization can be leveraged to create an information advantage took place in a training exercise in the mid-1990s when Royal Air Force (RAF) Tornado aircraft from U.K. 29 Squadron with tactical datalinks defeated U.S. Air Force F-15Cs with voice-only communications in a series of air-to-air engagements that took place during a red flag exercise in the airspace over the Nellis Air Force Base range. Historically, the most favorable outcome that the absolute best RAF pilots could manage when flying against F-15Cs was a draw. However, when the RAF introduced a datalink in the form of Link-16, U.K. 29 Squadron pilots, flying with new innovative tactics, were able to increase their kill ratio over the F-15C equipped with voice-only communications to approximately 4-to-1. The power of information sharing to increase survivability and lethality in the air-to-air mission was substantiated by the Air Force again in the mid-1990s during a joint tactical information distribution system (JTIDS) operational special project. Air Force pilots flying F-15Cs with and without datalinks clearly demonstrated an order of magnitude increase in information sharing enabled by the datalinks. This operational special project consisted of hundreds of tactical engagements, ranging in size from two-versus-two to eight-versus-16 aircraft, which were conducted during day and night conditions. During the more than 12,000 sorties and more than 19,000 flying hours, the average kill ratio for F-15Cs equipped with datalinks increased by more than 150 percent over F-15Cs fighting with voice-only communications, according to a JTIDS operational special project report to Congress. An analysis of the growing body of evidence highlights a very strong relationship between information advantage, cognitive advantage and increased lethality and survivability at the tactical level. It shows that these relationships are not unique to the air-to-air mission but rather that they were demonstrated first in this mission area as a result of the relative maturity of the application of networking technology in this arena. This same story line of increased warfighting effectiveness enabled by networking has been played out in counter special operations forces mission Fleet Battle Experiment Delta; counter anti-access, Fleet Battle Experiment Foxtrot; multinational rapid reaction forces, Allied Command Europe Mobile Force–Land; and combined arms maneuver warfare, Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I (DCX-I). During DCX-I, the blue force was digitized and networked to an unprecedented degree. Equally important, these forces were highly trained on this digital equipment and in many cases had developed new tactics, techniques and procedures to leverage their improved capability to operate in the information domain.</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The digitized and networked ground forces demonstrated significantly improved warfighting capabilities and were able to prevail over the opposing forces in a number of engagements</span>. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">For example, during one phase of the exercise, the blue force was in a defensive posture with the opposing force moving to contact under the cover of darkness. A significant column of armor was detected by the joint surveillance target attack radar system and positively identified as hostile by a Hunter unmanned aerial vehicle, Col. Fred Stein, USA (Ret.), explains. An analysis of the real-time blue ground picture indicated that the attacking opposing force column was located approximately 10 miles from the brigade combat team’s defensive positions. The brigade commander, in consultation with the division commander, decided to engage the hostile force, and the fire mission was assigned to close air support. At this point, the engagement departed from the usual script, which had been characterized in the past by some as an exercise in futility, according to an internal correspondence from the Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Test Center. F-16s and A/OA-10s of the Arizona Air National Guard equipped with the situational awareness data link (SADL) performed a close-air-support mission. The networking of these aircraft enabled them to exchange real-time targeting information as well as to receive and display a forward trace of the blue ground picture. The result of this networking was more than an order of magnitude improvement in the ability of ground and air forces to share information. In addition to being equipped with SADL, the F-16s were equipped with Lightening II targeting pods and a mixed weapons load of GBU-12s and AGM-65D Mavericks. The Forward Air Controller–Airborne (FAC-A) determined that employing the F-16s as a coordinated pair would maximize combat power. In engaging the ground targets, the A/OA-10 FAC-A identified targets of interest and distributed sensor points of interest over SADL to facilitate sensor cueing by the F-16’s Lightening II targeting pod. Employing these tactics enabled each wave of two-ship pairs to engage tanks selectively and avoid dropping ordnance on less significant targets. The battle damage assessment of the first wave of F-16s was “two battalions rendered combat ineffective.” Follow-on flights of F-16s were equally lethal, according to the Air National Guard correspondence.</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The net result of this engagement was that this phase of the training exercise had to be recocked to enable ground forces to accomplish their training objectives for hasty defense and counterattack successfully, </span>Col. Stein says. This transformation of close air support at night from an exercise in futility to devastatingly effective combat highlights the efficacy of network-centric warfare. The impact of digitization and networking on the combined arms fight, specifically the impact of digital close air support, is described in an Army evaluation of DCX-I. “The National Training Center is a playing field that often humbles the visiting team,” it reports. “However, during the U.S. Army’s Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I, the visiting team, in the form of the U.S. Army’s 4th Infantry Division, supported by elements of the U.S. Air Force, including elements of the Arizona Air National Guard, were able to leverage the power of an order of magnitude increase in information sharing to turn the tables on the opposing forces on at least two occasions. Of particular significance was a devastating defeat of opposing forces at night by F-16 and A/OA-10 aircraft performing the close-air-support mission.” <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Worldwide, militaries are crafting their individual responses to the challenges and opportunities of the information age. They are taking actions that demonstrate an increased understanding of the sources of information age warfighting advantage</span>. A new vocabulary has developed that reflects the subtle variations in underlying strategies and core missions of militaries worldwide. To varying degrees, these actions also are reflected in emerging concepts and doctrine, focused investments in key enablers and well-crafted programs of experimentation. Besides network-centric warfare, currently used by the armed forces of the United States, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, other coined terms include Australia’s network-enabled warfare, the United Kingdom’s network-enabled capability, the Swedish armed forces’ network-based defense and the armed forces of the Republic of Singapore’s knowledge-based command and control. Each of these terms reflects its respective military’s ongoing response to the information age. Clearly, militaries worldwide are continuing to take a close look at network-centric warfare and related concepts for information age warfare. Evidently they like what they see.

Liu Jianfei sees //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">U.S. influence as indispensable in shaping a new world order and cautions China about taking “too high a profile,” or “seeking to be a leader” of the international system. “China still needs more time to develop and open up to the outside world,</span>//” he says. “//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Many are calling for China to be the new leader in the new world order, but we need to continue down the road of reform and development and not adopt hegemonic tendencies. China also needs the cooperation and trade of the United States and other Western countries in order to succeed”</span>// [14]. What emerges is a lively debate in China about whether the international system is undergoing a fundamental shift that heralds the decline of U.S. power. As evidenced by the wide range of opinions, experts are far from reaching agreement on the core question of whether the United States is in decline. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The vast majority maintains that the prevailing international structure of power will not last; it eventually will give way to a multipolar era in which China and other emerging economies have an increasing say about issues of global importance</span>. At the same time, //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">many experts also caution that the transition to multipolarity will be a prolonged process, and that for the foreseeable future the United States will maintain its position at the helm of the international structure of power. Only a minority of experts view the United States as already in decline and the world on the cusp of becoming truly multipolar</span>//. //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Conspicuously absent from the debate is discussion of how a multipolar system would operate and what role China would play in the new world order. Would a more equal power distribution among major powers result in greater competition or cooperation, in balancing or bandwagoning, for example</span>//? <span style="font-size: 12pt;">If future international developments persuade Chinese leaders that the United States is in decline and that a multipolar world has arrived, Chinese experts will need to more closely examine such questions.</span> //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">An emerging multipolar world could prompt Beijing to adopt a more assertive foreign policy and military posture,</span>// //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">but could also provide incentives for China to be cooperative</span>//. //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tensions over territorial claims with the Philippines, Vietnam, and Japan continue to simmer, and a perceived power vacuum in the area could embolden China to assert greater influence over these disputed islands. Furthermore, the potential for China to adopt coercive policies against Taiwan is an ever-present danger looming over U.S.-China relations.</span>// Yet, //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Beijing might instead see its interests best served by working cooperatively with the other major powers to ensure a soft landing as the world transitions from “one superpower, many major powers” to a new multipolar pattern. </span>//Significant disincentives will exist to a revisionist shift in China’s foreign and defense policies. Assertiveness or aggression by China would likely cause the other major powers to band together to counter the emergent Chinese threat. //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Unless China perceives a threat to its vital interests</span>// (such as a declaration of independence by Taiwan),//<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Beijing may see strong incentives to act cautiously. The time may then come for China to </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">discard Deng Xiaoping’s dictum to “keep a low profile,” and </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">become the “responsible stakeholder” that the world hopes for rather than the next global hegemon.</span>//


TSAT secures All Military Satellite Systems – Anti-jamming, bandwidth, on the move communications

Alec <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Klein</span>, award-winning investigative business journalism, Journalism Prof Northwestern, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">08</span> [“Weapons Upgrade Faces Big Hurdles; Problems With Wireless Technology May Threaten Army's Ambitious Plan”, Washington Post, April 8, [[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Sci/sci.military.naval/2008-04/msg00764.html]]]

At risk also is <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the development of the Transformational Satellite Communications program, or TSAT, an Air Force project that is supposed to work with Future Combat Systems.</span> The Defense Department is planning to cut about $4 billion of the TSAT budget over the next five years, partly because of congressional concerns about an expensive and technical project that already has been cut, delayed and restructured. The Air Force has yet to select a contractor for the project, though Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the two leading contenders, have both been working on development contracts. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">TSAT would be about 100 times faster than military satellites in orbit now, Air Force officials say. That's to an extent because the satellites would take advantage of the latest Internet technology to reroute communications traffic more efficiently, they say</span>. //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">TSAT is expected to also provide more securely encrypted communications for Future Combat Systems to prevent enemies from intercepting or jamming signals</span>//. Until recently, military officials said the program would launch its first satellite in 2016, though now they say the schedule is uncertain. According to a 2006 report, the GAO said TSAT began without sufficiently mature technology, noting that costs have increased and the timetable has been delayed. Before the latest cutbacks, according to the Air Force, the program had increased by about $8 billion, or 50 percent, to $24 billion, including inflation. The new cutbacks will defer work, delaying the timetable and adding to the program's overall expense because of "the costs associated with extending the contract to perform necessary work," the military said. But Richard Pino, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the Air Force's TSAT program director, said "the technologies are all at the right levels of maturity."</span> Boeing's Muilenburg said the prospect of additional cuts should not pose a problem for Future Combat Systems. In lieu of TSAT, he said that the Army program could use current military and commercial satellites. Loren B. Thompson, a defense consultant at the Lexington Institute, a public policy think tank, said, however, that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">TSAT "is crucial to the secure networking capabilities that underpin" Future Combat Systems. Given the cutbacks, he said, "If TSAT collapses, which looks like a distinct possibility, soldiers may have to rely on links that are harder to access on the move, more vulnerable to jamming and interceptions, and offer nowhere near as much bandwidth</span>." Cristina Chaplain, who oversees the GAO's review of space systems, also said that //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">"TSAT was being designed to support communications on the move, whereas other programs don't do that to the extent that's needed by" Future Combat Systems</span>//. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sorenson, the Army's chief information officer, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">acknowledges that the development of TSAT and the other complementary programs represent a "high risk," but he said the military is attempting to manage that risk by developing the programs incrementally</span>. Rickey E. Smith, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">a retired Army colonel who is part of the military team designing how Future Combat Systems will be used, said that if the complementary programs fail, the Army project would certainly be impacted, but so would other military services that depend on these technologies. </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">And he said that while the GAO does good work, "They've never seen a program they liked</span>//." For the GAO's Francis, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the question for his team of investigators is not whether they like these military programs but whether they will work in concert with Future Combat Systems.</span>



NCW impossible without TSATs – space is key

James W. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Canan</span>, former senior editor of Air Force Magazine, 06 [“Timing in Battle: The T-Sat Edge”, AEROSPACE AMERICA/JANUARY 20<span style="font-size: 13pt;">06,</span> [[http://www.aiaa.org/Aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_Jan06_CAN.pdf|www.aiaa.org/Aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_Jan06_CAN.pdf]], mcG]

<span style="color: #094b98;">B</span>y all accounts, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the success of the Pentagon’s ambitious plan to transform the U.S. military into a network-centric force is riding on the</span> transformational satellite communications system (<span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat</span>) now in development. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Defense planners are convinced that full-scale military transformation and network-centric operations will be impossible to achieve without the spaceborne communications that the revolutionary T-Sat constellation would provide.The military has begun its transition to highly mobile, fast-reaction, quick-strike, netcentric forces that include increasing numbers of autonomous or semiautonomous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).It</span> therefore <span style="font-size: 12pt;">requires ultrareliable, superswift communications among all sorts of sensor systems, weapons platforms, and command posts in the air, on land, and at sea around the globe. T-Sats will be the space element</span>, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and the sine qua non, of the military’s planned GIG </span>(global information grid)—its “Internet in the sky.” <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thus the T-Sat system is seen as “the cornerstone of [the Defense Dept.’s] future information operations</span>,” <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the “centerpiece of our future global communications network,” and “the heart of the DOD net-centric operations environment concept essential to all future operations,”</span> a Pentagon document proclaims.

Net-Centric Warfare is the only way to secure the information age – NCW will transform the military to match up with rising powers

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Arquilla 10</span> (John Arquilla, professor of defense analysis at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, MARCH/APRIL 2010, “The New Rules of War”, [[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/22/the_new_rules_of_war]])

In another sign of the gathering swarm, the August 2008 Russian incursion into Georgia, rather than being a blast from the Cold War past, heralded the possibility that more traditional armies can master the art of omnidirectional attack. In this instance, Russian regular forces were augmented by ethnic militias fighting all over the area of operations — <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and there was swarming in cyberspace at the same time. Indeed, the distributed denial of service attack, long a staple of cyberwarriors, is a model form of swarming</span>. And in this instance, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Georgian command and control was seriously disrupted by the hackers</span>. Simultaneous attack from several directions might be at the very cutting edge in conflict, but its lineage is quite old. Traditional tribal warfare, whether by nomadic horse archers or bush fighters, always featured some elements of swarms. The zenith of this kind of fighting probably came with the 13th-century Mongols, who had a name for this doctrine: “Crow Swarm.” When the attack was not carried out at close quarters by charging horsemen, but was instead conducted via arrows raining down on massed targets, the khans called it “Falling Stars.” With such tactics, the Mongols carved out the largest empire the world has ever seen, and kept it for a few centuries. But swarming was eclipsed by the rise of guns in the 15th century, which strongly favored massed volley fire. Industrial processes encouraged even more massing, and mechanization favored large flank maneuvers more than small swarms. Now again, in an age of global interdependence replete with advanced information technologies, even quite small teams of fighters can cause huge amounts of disruption. There is an old Mongol proverb: “With 40 men you can shake the world.” Look at what al Qaeda did with less than half that number on Sept. 11, 2001. This point was made by the great British strategist B.H. Liddell Hart in his biography of T.E. Lawrence, a master of the swarm in his own right. Liddell Hart, writing in 1935, predicted that at some point “the old concentration of force is likely to be replaced by an intangibly ubiquitous distribution of force — pressing everywhere, yet assailable nowhere.” Now, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">swarming is making a comeback, but at a time when few organized militaries are willing or able to recognize its return. </span>For the implications of this development — most notably, that fighting units in very small numbers can do amazing things if used to swarm — are profoundly destabilizing. The most radical change is this: Standing armies can be sharply reduced in size, if properly reconfigured and trained to fight in this manner. Instead of continually “surging” large numbers of troops to trouble spots, the basic response of a swarm force would be to go swiftly, in small numbers, and strike the attackers at many points. In the future, it will take a swarm to defeat a swarm. Almost 20 years ago, I began a debate about networks that blossomed into an unlikely friendship with Vice Adm. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Art Cebrowski, the modern strategic thinker most likely to be as well remembered as Alfred Thayer Mahan, the great American apostle of sea power. He was the first in the Pentagon power structure to warm to my notions of developing fighting networks, embracing the idea of opening lots of lateral communications links between “sensors and shooters</span>.” We disagreed, however, about the potential of networks. Cebrowski thought that “<span style="font-size: 12pt;">network-centric warfare” could be used to improve the performance of existing tools</span> — including aircraft carriers — for some time to come. I thought that networking implied a wholly new kind of navy, one made up of small, swift vessels, many of them remotely operated. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cebrowski</span>, who passed away in late 2005, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">clearly won this debate</span>, as <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the U.S. Navy remains heavily invested in being a “few-large” force — if one that is increasingly networked</span>. In an implicit nod to David Ronfeldt’s and my ideas, the Navy even has a Netwar Command now. Swarming has also gained some adherents. The most notable has been Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, who famously used swarm tactics in the last great Pentagon war game, “Millennium Challenge 2002,” to sink several aircraft carriers at the outset of the imagined conflict. But rather than accept that something quite radical was going on, the referees were instructed to “refloat” the carriers, and the costly game — its price tag ran in the few hundred millions — continued. Van Riper walked out. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Today, some in the U.S. military still pursue the idea of swarming, mostly in hopes of employing large numbers of small unmanned aerial vehicles in combat</span>. But military habits of mind and institutional interests continue to reflect a greater audience for surges than swarms. What //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">if senior military leaders wake up and decide to take networks and swarming absolutely seriously</span>//? If they ever do, //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">it is likely that the scourges of terrorism and aggression will become less a part of the world system</span>//. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Such a military would be smaller but quicker to respond, less costly but more lethal. The world system would become far less prone to many of the kinds of violence that have plagued it</span>. Networking and swarming are the organizational and doctrinal keys, respectively, to the strategic puzzle that has been waiting to be solved in our time. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">A networked U.S. military that knows how to swarm would have much smaller active manpower</span> — easily two-thirds less than the more than 2 million serving today — but would be organized in hundreds more little units of mixed forces. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The model for military intervention would be the 200 Special Forces “horse soldiers</span>” who beat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan late in 2001. Such teams would deploy quickly and lethally, with ample reserves for relieving “first waves” and dealing with other crises. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">At sea, instead of concentrating firepower in a handful of large, increasingly vulnerable supercarriers, the U.S. Navy would distribute its capabilities across many hundreds of small craft armed with very smart weapons.</span> Given their stealth and multiple uses, submarines would stay while carriers would go. And in the air, the “wings” would reduce in size but increase in overall number, with mere handfuls of aircraft in each. Needless to say, networking means that these small pieces would still be able to join together to swarm enemies, large or small. Is such a shift feasible? Absolutely. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Big reductions in the U.S. military are nothing new. The massive demobilization after World War II aside, active forces were reduced 40 percent in the few years after the Vietnam War and by another third right after the end of the Cold War</span>. But the key is not so much in cutting as it is in redesigning and rethinking. But what happens if the status quo prevails and the potential of this new round of changes in strategic affairs is ignored or misinterpreted? Failure awaits, at ruinous cost. //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The most likely form catastrophe could take is that terrorist networks would stay on their feet long enough to acquire nuclear weapons</span>//. Even a handful of warheads in Osama bin Laden’s hands would give him great coercive power, as a network cannot be targeted for retaliation the same way a country can. Deterrence will lie in tatters. If there is ever to be a nuclear Napoleon, he will come from a terrorist network. Within the U.S. military, the danger is that senior commanders will fall back on a fatalism driven by their belief that both congressional and industrial leaders will thwart any effort at radical change. I have heard this objection countless times since the early 1990s, repeated mantra-like, all the way up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thus the mighty U.S. war machine is like a Gulliver trussed up by Lilliputian politicians and businessmen. The irony, however, is that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the U.S. military has never been in a better position to gain acceptance for truly transformational change. Neither party in Congress can afford to be portrayed as standing in the way of strategic progress, and so, whatever the Pentagon asks for, it gets.</span> As for <span style="font-size: 12pt;">defense contractors</span>, far from driving the agenda, they <span style="font-size: 12pt;">are much too willing to give their military customers exactly what they demand</span> (rather than, perhaps, something better). <span style="font-size: 12pt;">If the U.S. armed forces call for smaller, smarter weapons and systems to support swarming, they will get them. </span>Beyond the United States, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">other countries' security forces are beginning to think along the lines of "many and small," are crafting better ways to "find," and are learning to swarm. Chinese naval thought today is clearly moving in this direction. Russian ground forces are, too</span>. Needless to say, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">terrorist networks are still in the lead,</span> and not just al Qaeda. Hezbollah gave quite a demonstration of all three of the new rules of war in its summer 2006 conflict with Israel, a virtual laboratory test of nation versus network -- in which the network more than held its own. For the U.S. military, //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">failing a great leap forward in self-awareness of the need for radical change, a downward budgetary nudge is probably the best approach</span>// -- despite President Barack Obama's unwillingness to extend his fiscal austerity program to security-related expenditures. This could take the form of a freeze on defense spending levels, to be followed by several years of, say, 10 percent annual reductions. To focus the redesign effort, a moratorium would be declared on all legacy-like systems (think aircraft carriers, other big ships, advanced fighters, tanks, etc.) while they are subjected to searching review. It should not be assumed that the huge sums invested in national defense have been wisely spent. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">To most Americans who think that being strong on defense means devoting more resources and building bigger systems, this suggestion to cut spending will sound outrageous</span>. But <span style="font-size: 12pt;">being smarter about defense might lower costs even as effectiveness improves. This pattern has held throughout the transformations of the last few decades, whether in farming or in industry. Why should the military be exempt? </span>There's real urgency to this debate. Not only has history not ended with the Cold War and the advent of commerce-driven globalization, but conflict and violence have persisted -- even grown -- into a new postmodern scourge.Indeed, it is ironic that, in an era in which the attraction to persuasive "soft power" has grown dramatically, coercive "hard power" continues to dominate in world affairs. This is no surprise in the case of rogue nations hellbent on developing nuclear arsenals to ensure their security, nor when it comes to terrorist networks that think their essential nature is revealed in and sustained by violent acts. But this primary reliance on coercive capabilities is also on display across a range of countries great and small, most notably the United States, whose defense policy has over the past decade largely become its foreign policy. From the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to simmering crises with North Korea and Iran, and on to longer-range strategic concerns about East Asian and Central European security, the United States today is heavily invested in hard-power solutions. And it will continue to be. But if the radical adjustments in strategy, organization, and doctrine implied by the new rules of war are ignored,<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Americans will go on spending more and getting less when it comes to national defense</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">.</span>**</span>**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Networks will persist until they have the capability to land nuclear blows</span>**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Other countries will leapfrog ahead of the United States militarily, and concepts like "deterrence" and "containment" of aggression will blow away like leaves in the wind. </span>So it has always been. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Every era of technological change has resulted in profound shifts in military and strategic affairs</span>. History tells us that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">these developments were inevitable, but soldiers and statesmen were almost always too late in embracing them -- and tragedies upon tragedies ensued. There is still time to be counted among the exceptions</span>, like the Byzantines who, after the fall of Rome, radically redesigned their military and preserved their empire for another thousand years. The U.S. goal should be to join the ranks of those who, in their eras, caught glimpses of the future and acted in time to shape it, saving the world from darkness.

The sober new assessment of al-Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen has helped prompt senior Obama administration officials to call for an escalation of U.S. operations there - including a proposal to add armed CIA drones to a clandestine campaign of U.S. military strikes, the officials said. "We are looking to draw on all of the capabilities at our disposal," said a senior Obama administration official, who described plans for "a ramp-up over a period of months." The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, stressed that that analysts continue to see al-Qaeda and its allies in the tribal areas of Pakistan as supremely dangerous adversaries. The officials insisted there would be no letup in their pursuit of Osama bin Laden and other senior figures thought to be hiding in Pakistan.

Philip Mudd, a former senior official at the CIA and the FBI, argues in a forthcoming article that the threat of a Sept. 11-style attack has been supplanted by a proliferation of plots by AQAP and other affiliates. "The sheer numbers . . . suggest that one of the plots in the United States will succeed," he writes in the latest issue of CTC Sentinel, a publication of the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y. </span>__In the future__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, he said, "</span>__the Pakistan__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">-Afghanistan </span>__border__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> region </span>__will not be the__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> sole, or </span>__even____primary, source of__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> bombing </span>__suspects__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">."

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Osama bin Laden has always had a very soft spot in his heart for Yemen, saying that it is “one of the best Arab and Muslim countries in terms of its adherence to tradition and the faith … [its] topography is mountainous, and its people are tribal and armed, and allow one to breathe clean air unblemished by humiliation.” Yemen is, of course, also the site of his family’s origin and he has often praised the Kindah tribe of which his family is part. The bin Ladens hail from the village of al-Rubat in the Hadramaut region, and Osama took his fourth wife from there. Bin Laden also has referred often to the religious importance of Yemen, noting the Prophet Muhammad’s high regard for Yemen because of its quick adoption of Islam after the faith’s founding and because he believed that from Yemen “would come 12,000 [fighters] who would support God and His Prophet, and they are among the best of us” (al-Islah, September 2, 1996). Abundant Manpower But affection is always overruled by the requirements of war-fighting in bin Laden’s mentality and </span>__Yemen has **long figured prominently** in the conduct of the defensive jihad in **terms of manpower and geographic importance**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__Yemenis__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for example, </span>__have **had significant representation** in al-Qaeda since its founding__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: Tariq al-Fahdli, from southern Yemen, fought alongside bin Laden against the Soviets and was on Yemeni President Salih’s senior council; Nasir Ahmad Nasir al-Bahri (Abu Jandal), who was the longtime chief of his bodyguard unit, is also from Yemen (al-Quds al-Arabi, August 3, 2004). After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, moreover, bin Laden and several of his colleagues sent guns, money and Arab veterans of Afghanistan into Yemen to fight alongside the Salih-led insurgents who eventually defeated the communist regime of southern Yemen to reunify the country in 1990 (al-Qatan al-Arabi, December 27, 1996). Al-Qaeda’s first anti-U.S. attack—against U.S. troops on the way to Somalia—was conducted in Aden, Yemen, in December 1992. More recently, 80 percent of those involved in the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole were Saudis of Yemeni origin. The members of the al-Qaeda cell that the FBI dismantled in Lackawanna, New York in 2002 were all Yemenis. Furthermore, a significant number of the non-Iraqi mujahideen fighting U.S. forces in Iraq are Yemenis. Indeed, in late 2007 the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Hamzah al-Muhajir, called specifically on the Yemeni Islamists to provide more fighters to support the Iraqi mujahideen. On November 29, 2007, al-Qaeda’s chief in Yemen, Nasir al-Wihayshi (aka Abu Basir), publicly answered that he would immediately send more fighters. “Oh Abu Hamzah, here we come, oh, Iraq, here we come,” Abu Basir pledged (Message from the Amir of al-Qaeda in Yemen to Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, November 29, 2007). Lasting Geographic Importance Beyond “the extended manpower fighting for God in happy Yemen,” bin Laden and </span>__al-Qaeda have always valued what they refer to as “**the strategic depth**” that Yemen affords__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(al-Islah, September 2, 1996; al-Quds al-Arabi, March 9, 1994). While bin Laden and his organization were based in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, for example, they established a sort of “naval bridge” that permitted the flow of guns and fighters between Yemen and Port Sudan in support of Hasan al-Turabi’s Islamist regime in Khartoum. In the other direction, bin Laden sent al-Qaeda operatives from Port Sudan to Yemen and from there infiltrated them into Saudi Arabia across the imperfectly guarded Saudi-Yemeni border as well as into Oman. In Yemen, bin Laden also cultivated ties with President Salih and prominent Islamist shaykhs—including Shaykh Abdul Majid al-Zindani, head of the Yemen Reform Party—and by doing so facilitated the growth of substantial al-Qaeda infrastructure across the country. Al-Qaeda’s presence in Yemen also brought it into closer contact with the Egyptian Islamist groups based there: the Gama’a al-Islamiyah and Ayman al-Zawahiri’s Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the latter of which later united with al-Qaeda. Finally, </span>__al-Qaeda has found that some of its Yemeni members are **of great assistance** in **inserting al-Qaeda operatives into** **the states of East Africa, the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>__because of the Yemeni diaspora that was established centuries ago in those regions by Yemeni sailors and commercial traders__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Operational Key and Base of Last Resort </span>__For al-Qaeda, Yemen provides a **pivotal, central base** that **links its theaters of operation** in Afghanistan, Iraq, East Africa and the Far East; it **also provides a base for training Yemeni fighters** and for the rest and refit of fighters from multiple Islamist groups after their tours in Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Today, </span>__it appears to be an **especially important safe haven**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for Somali Islamist fighters and the leaders of the Union of Islamic Courts who fled their country after the late-2006 invasion of Ethiopian forces. Some of these Somali fighters—after having regrouped and rearmed—have returned to Mogadishu from Yemen and are contributing to the growth of the Islamist insurgency there (Christian Science Monitor, February 12, 2007). Al-Qaeda’s organization in Yemen seems to have stabilized after the period of turmoil and governmental suppression that followed the November 2002 death of its leader Abu Ali Harithi. Under the above-mentioned Abu Basir—who escaped from a Yemeni prison in early 2006—al-Qaeda in Yemen clearly has found its legs and is becoming more active (Yemen Times, July 5, 2007). In late June 2007, for example, Abu Basir issued a warning that al-Qaeda would attack in Yemen if its members were not released from prison; on July 4, 2007, al-Qaeda attacked, using a suicide car bomb to kill seven Spanish tourists at an ancient pagan temple east of San’a (al-Jazeera, July 3, 2007). Then, on January 13, the Yemen wing again warned that it would attack if the Salih regime did not release imprisoned al-Qaeda members; on January 19 al-Qaeda killed two Belgian tourists and their drivers in the Hadramaut area (Reuters, January 13; Yemen Times, January 26). Abu Basir’s organization is thus showing some of the same sophistication demonstrated by al-Qaeda groups elsewhere: targeting the tourism industry that earns the country foreign exchange; establishing credibility by making threats and then making good on them; and improving intra-Yemen and international communications by using the internet. In regard to the latter, al-Qaeda in Yemen published the first issue of its internet journal Sada al-Malahim (The Echo of Battles) on January 13 (memriwmp.org, January 16). Attacks by al-Qaeda in Yemen are likely to continue at a level that does not lead to an all-out confrontation with Salih’s regime. In all likelihood, al-Qaeda intends to cause just enough sporadic damage to persuade Salih’s regime that it is best to curtail its efforts to destroy al-Qaeda and to allow the group to operate relatively freely in and from Yemen as long as no major attacks are staged in the country. Indeed, such a modus vivendi may be in the works as San’a officials have experimented with putting imprisoned Islamists through a reeducation process that shows them the error of their ways and then releases them on the promise of good behavior (al-Sharq al-Awsat, May 21, 2006). This almost certainly equates to a license for the militants to do what they want, where they want, as long as it is not in Yemen. Possibly signaling a growing rapprochement between Salih and the militants, al-Qaeda in Yemen spokesman Ahmad Mansur recently claimed that the government had solicited al-Qaeda’s support in fighting Shiite rebels in the north in return for “easing the persecution of our members” (al-Wasat, January 31). Finally, </span>__Yemen has long been regarded__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">by Western and Muslim commentators </span>__as a possible **refuge-of-last-resort**__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">if bin Laden ever has to flee South Asia—bin Laden also has stated such a possibility—and </span>__for this reason al-Qaeda must seek to **maintain a viable presence in the country**.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Al-Qaeda in Yemen is particularly strong in the governorates of Marib and Hadramaut—the attacks described above and others have occurred there—and both share a remote, mountainous topography that is much like that of Afghanistan. The two provinces also are inhabited by a welter of deeply conservative Islamic tribes—Marib alone has four powerful tribes with over 70 clans. As in Afghanistan, the mores of these Yemeni tribes cause their members to “think they must do their duty to protect those who are in need for protection whatever they have done. This feeling becomes even stronger if those who need protection are religious people, because the tribesmen here are greatly affected by religious discourse” </span>

Freight trains were found to be carrying weapons-grade nuclear material across the Kazakhstan-Russia border, highly enriched uranium was transported across Uganda by bus, and a “small time hustler” in Lisbon offered to sell radioactive plates stolen from Chernobyl. In one incident in September 2009, two employees at the Rossing Uranium Mine in Namibia smuggled almost half a ton of uranium concentrate powder – yellowcake – out of the compound in plastic bags. “Acute safety and security concerns” were even raised in 2008 about the uranium and plutonium laboratory of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the nuclear safety watchdog. Tomihiro Taniguchi, the deputy director general of the IAEA, has privately warned America that the world faces the threat of a “nuclear 9/11″ if stores of uranium and plutonium were not secured against terrorists.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Terrorism causes full scale nuclear conflict- preemption and miscalculation</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ayson 10</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> – Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand at the Victoria University of Wellington (Robert, July. “After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects.” Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, Vol. 33, Issue 7. InformaWorld.)</span>



<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">But these two nuclear worlds—a non-state actor nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange—are not necessarily separable. It is just possible that </span>__<span style="color: black;">some sort of terrorist attack</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, and </span>__<span style="color: black;">especially</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> an act of </span>__<span style="color: black;">nuclear terrorism</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, </span>__<span style="color: black;">could precipitate a chain of events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapons between two or more</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> of the </span>__<span style="color: black;">states</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> that possess them. In this context, today’s and tomorrow’s terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the early Cold War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals who were seen as </span>**__<span style="color: black;">raising the risks of acatalyticnuclear war between the superpowers</span>__**__<span style="color: black;">started by third parties</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. These risks were considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem. It may require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially plausible situation where an act of nuclear terrorism could lead to such a massive inter-state nuclear war. For example, in the event of a terrorist nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered just how Russia and/or China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not least because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far too responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist behavior that could just as easily threaten them as well. Some possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example, how might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that the fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from Russian stocks,40 and if for some reason Moscow denied any responsibility for nuclear laxity? The correct attribution of that nuclear material to a particular country might not be a case of science fiction given the observation by Michael May et al. that while the debris resulting from a nuclear explosion would be “spread over a wide area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable, identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of information can be obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the explosion, the materials used and, most important … some indication of where the nuclear material came from.”41 Alternatively, if the act of nuclear terrorism came as a complete surprise, and American officials refused to believe that a terrorist group was fully responsible (or responsible at all) suspicion would shift immediately to state possessors. Ruling out Western ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably Israel and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a very short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program continues, and possibly Pakistan. But </span>__<span style="color: black;">at what stage would Russia and China be</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> definitely </span>__<span style="color: black;">ruled out</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> in this high stakes game of nuclear Cluedo? In particular</span>__<span style="color: black;">, if the act </span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">of nuclear terrorism</span>__<span style="color: black;">occurred against a backdrop of existing tension </span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">in Washington’s relations</span>__<span style="color: black;">with Russia and/or China</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, and at a time when threats had already been traded between these major powers, </span>**__<span style="color: black;">would officials and political leaders not be tempted to assume the worst</span>__**<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">? Of course, the chances of this occurring would only seem to increase if the United States was already involved in some sort of limited armed conflict with Russia and/or China, or if they were confronting each other from a distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments may seem at the present time. The reverse might well apply too: should a nuclear terrorist attack occur in Russia or China during a period of heightened tension or even limited conflict with the United States, could Moscow and Beijing resist the pressures that might rise domestically to consider the United States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of the attack? </span>__<span style="color: black;">Washington’s early response</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own soil </span>__<span style="color: black;">might</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> also </span>__<span style="color: black;">raise the possibility of an unwanted</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> (and nuclear aided) </span>__<span style="color: black;">confrontation</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> with Russia and/or China. For example, in the noise and confusion during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist nuclear attack, </span>__<span style="color: black;">the U.S. president might be expected to place the country’s</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> armed forces, including its </span>__<span style="color: black;">nuclear arsenal</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, </span>__<span style="color: black;">on a higher stage of alert</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. In such a tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of reality, </span>__<span style="color: black;">it is </span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">just </span>__<span style="color: black;">possible that **Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intentions to use force**</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> (and possibly nuclear force) against them. In that situation, the </span>**__<span style="color: black;">temptations to preempt</span>__**<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">such actions might</span>__<span style="color: black;"> **grow**</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, although it must be admitted that any preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response. As part of its initial response to the act of nuclear terrorism (as discussed earlier) Washington might decide to order a significant conventional (or nuclear) retaliatory or disarming attack against the leadership of the terrorist group and/or states seen to support that group. Depending on the identity and especially the location of these targets, Russia and/or China might interpret such action as being far too close for their comfort, and potentially as an infringement on their spheres of influence and even on their sovereignty. One far-fetched but perhaps not impossible scenario might stem from a judgment in Washington that some of the main aiders and abetters of the terrorist action resided somewhere such as Chechnya, perhaps in connection with what Allison claims is the “Chechen insurgents’ … long-standing interest in all things nuclear.”42 American pressure on that part of the world would almost certainly raise alarms in Moscow that might require a degree of advanced consultation from Washington that the latter found itself unable or unwilling to provide. There is also the question of how other nuclear-armed states respond to the act of nuclear terrorism on another member of that special club. It could reasonably be expected that following a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States, bothRussia and China would extend immediate sympathy and support to Washington and would work alongside the United States in the Security Council. But there is just a chance, albeit a slim one, where the support of Russia and/or China is less automatic in some cases than in others. For example, what would happen if the United States wished to discuss its right to retaliate against groups based in their territory? If, for some reason, Washington found the responses of Russia and China deeply underwhelming, (neither “for us or against us”) might it also suspect that they secretly were in cahoots with the group, increasing (again perhaps ever so slightly) the chances of a major exchange. If the terrorist group had some connections to groups in Russia and China, or existed in areas of the world over which Russia and China held sway, and if Washington felt that Moscow or Beijing were placing a curiously modest level of pressure on them, what conclusions might it then draw about their culpability?</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A looming danger confronts the world—the threat of bioviolence. It is a danger that will only grow in the future, yet we are increasingly failing to confront it. With every passing day, committing a biocatastrophe becomes a bit easier, and this condition will perpetuate for as long as science progresses. Biological warfare is as old as conflict, of course, but in terms of the objectives of traditional warfare— gaining territory or resources, compelling the surrender of an opposing army—biological weapons weren’t very effective. If the objective is to inflict mass death and panic on a mixed population, however, emerging bioweapons offer remarkable potential. We would be irresponsible to presume that radical jihadists like al Qaeda have ignored said potential. What’s New in Bioviolence? Bioviolence refers to the many ways to inflict disease as well as the many people who might choose to do so, whether heads of states, criminals, or fanatics. Fortunately, doing bioviolence is technically far more difficult than using conventional explosives. Natural pathogens like anthrax are difficult to weaponize. Smallpox remains unavailable (presumably); plague is readily treatable; Ebola k i l l s t o o q u i c k l y t o i g n i t e a p a ndemic. But emerging scientific disciplines—notably genomics, nanotechnology, and other microsciences— could alter these pathogens for use as weapons. These scientific disciplines offer profound benefits for humanity, yet there is an ominous security challenge in minimizing the danger of their hostile application. For exampl e , </span>__highly dangerous agents can be **made resistant** to vaccines or antibiotics__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In Australia, scientists introduced a gene into mousepox (a cousin of smallpox) to reduce pest populations—it worked so well that it wiped out 100% of affected mice, even those that had immunity against the disease. Various bacterial agents, such as plague or tularemia (rabbit fever), could be altered to increase their lethality or to evade antibiotic treatment. </span>__Diseases once thought to be eradicated can now be **resynthesized**, enabling them to **spread** **in reg ions where there is no natural immunity**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The polio virus has been synthesized from scratch; its creators called it an “animate chemical.” Soon, it may be resynthesized into a form that is contagious even among vaccinated popu l a t i o n s . </span>__Recreation of long eradicated livestock diseases could ravage herds severely **lacking in genetic diversity**, **damage food supplies** , and cause **devastating economic losses**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Perhaps the </span>__greatest biothreat is the **manipulation of the flu**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and other highly contagious viruses, such as Ebola. Today, scientists can change parts of a virus’s genetic material so that it can perform specific functions. </span>__The genomic sequence of the Spanish flu virus that killed upwards of 40 million people__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nearly a century ago </span>__has been widely published; any savvy scientist could reconstruct it.____The avian flu is **even more lethal**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, albeit not readily contagious via casual aerosol delivery. A malevolent bioscientist might augment its contagiousness. The Ebola virus might be manipulat ed so that i t ki l l s more slowly, allowing it to be spread farther before its debilitating effects altogether consume its carrier. A bit further off is genetic manipulation of the measles virus—one of the great killers in human history—rendering useless the immunizations that most of us receive in early childhood. </span>__Soon , **laboratory resynthesis of smallpox may be possible**. Advanced drug delivery systems can be used to **disseminate lethal agent s to broad populations**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> . </span>__Bioregulators — small organic compounds that modify body systems— could **enhance targeted delivery technologies**.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Some experts are concerned that new weapons could be aimed at the immune, neurological, and neuroendocrine systems. Nanotechnology that lends itself to mechanisms for advanced disease detection and drug delivery—such as gold nanotubes that can administer drugs directly into a tumor—could also deliver weaponized agents deep into the body, substantially raising the weapon’s effectiveness. Altogether, techniques that were on the frontiers of science only a decade or two ago are rapidly mutating as progress in the biological sciences enables new ways to produce lethal catastrophe. Today, they are on the horizon. Within a decade, they will be pedestrian. </span>__According to__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">the </span>__N__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ational </span>__A__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">cademies of </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">cience, “</span>__The threat spectrum **is broad and evolving**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—in some ways predictably, in </span>**other ways __unexpectedly__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the future,</span> __genetic engineering__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and other technologies</span> __may lead to the development of pathogenic organisms with **unique, unpredictable characteristics**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” For as far into the future as we can possibly see, every passing day it becomes slightly easier to commit a violent catastrophe than it was the day before. Indeed, the rapid pace of advancing science helps explain why policies to prevent such a catastrophe are so complicated. Bioviolence Jihad? </span>__Some experts argue that terrorists__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and fanatics </span>__are not interested in bioviolence__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and that the danger might therefore be overblown. Since there have been no catastrophic bioviolence attacks, these experts argue, terrorists lack the intention to make bioweapons. Hopefully, they are correct. But </span>__an **enormous amount of evidence** **suggests they are wrong**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. From the dawn of biology’s ability to isolate pathogens, people have pursued hostile applications of biological agents. It is perilous to ignore this extensive history by presuming that today’s villains are not fervent about weaponizing disease. Not a single state admits to having a bioweapons program, but U.S. int e l l i g e n c e o f f i c i a l s a s s e r t t h a t a s many as 10 states might have active programs, including North Korea, Iran, and Syria. Moreover, many terrorist organizations have expressed interest in acquiring biological weapons. Whatever weight the </span>__taboo against inflicting disease__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> might have for nation-states, it </span>__is **obviously irrelevant to terrorists**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, criminals, and lunatics. </span>__Deterrence by threat of retaliation is essentially meaningless for groups with suicidal inclinations__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">who are likely to intermingle with innocent civilians. </span>__Al -Qaeda__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and aff i l iat ed I s lami c fundamentalist organizations </span>__have **overtly proclaimed** **their intention to develop and use bioweapons**.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The 11th volume of al-Qaeda’s Encyclopedia of Jihad is devoted to chemical and biological weapons. Indeed, alQaeda has acknowledged that “biological weapons are considered the least complicated and easiest to manufacture of all weapons of mass destruction.” </span>__Al-Qaeda is **widely reported** to have **acquired legal pathogens** **via publicly available scientific sources**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Before 9/11, </span>__al-Qaeda operatives__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> reportedly purchased anthrax and plague from arms dealers in Kazakhstan, and the group </span>__has repeatedly urged followers to **recruit** **microbiology and biotechnology experts**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Follow ing th e Ta l iban ’ s fa l l , f iv e </span>__a l Qaeda bio__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">logi cal </span>__weapons labs__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in Afghanistan </span>__tested positive for anthrax__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__Documents calculating **aerial dispersal methods**__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of anthrax via balloon </span>__were discovered__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in Kabul, along with anthrax spore concentrate at a nearby vaccine laboratory. According to a lengthy fatwa commissioned by Osama bin Laden, jihadists are entitled to use weapons of mass destruction against the infidels, even if it means killing innocent women, children, and Muslims. No matter that these weapons cannot be specifically targeted. “[N]othing is a greater duty, after faith itself, than repelling an enemy attacker who sows corruption to religion and the world.” According to the fatwa, “No conditions limit this: one repels the enemy however one can.” The sentiment might be reprehen sible, but it is certainly not irrational. Even the most passionate terrorists must realize that conventional attacks are not bringing the West to its knees. The 9/11 strikes, the bombing of the Madrid and London subways, and numerous smaller attacks have all put civilization on edge, but history marches inexorably forward. A few thousand people can be killed, yet Western armies still traverse the world, and Western economies still determine winners and losers. From this perspective, the stakes must be raised. Bioviolence is perhaps the most dire, easiest means to execute existential danger. What Might Bioviolence Accomplish? Envision a series of attacks against capitals of developing states that have close diplomatic linkages with the United States. The attacks would carry a well-publicized yet simple warning: “If you are a friend of the United States, receive its officials, or suppo r t i t s po l i c i e s , thou sand s o f y o u r p e o p l e wi l l g e t s i c k . ” How many a t ta ck s in how many c i t i e s would it take before international diplomacy, to say nothing of international transit, comes to a crashing halt? In comparison to use of conventional or chemical weapons, the potential death toll of a bioattack could be huge . Al though the numbe r of victims would depend on where an attack takes place, the type of pathogen, and the sophistication of the weapons maker, there is widespread consensus among experts that a heightened attack would inflict casualties exceedable only by nuclear weapons. In comparison to nuclear weapons, </span>__bioweapons are far easier and cheaper to make and transport, and they can be made in facilities that are far more difficult to detect__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__The truly unique characteristic of__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">c e r t a i n</span> __bioweapons__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">t h a t d i s t i nguishes them from every other type of weapon</span> __**is contagion.** No other__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">type of</span> __weapon **can replicate itself and spread**. Any other type of attack__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, no matter how severe,</span> __occurs at a certain moment in time at an identifiable place.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> If you aren’t there, you are angry and upset but not physically injured by the attack. </span>__An attack with a contagious agent **can uniquely spread**, potentially imperiling target populations **far from where the agents are released**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A b i o - o ff e n d e r c o u l d i n f e c t h i s minions with a disease and send them across borders before symptoms are obvious. Carriers will then spread it to other unsuspecting victims who would themselves become extended bioweapons, carrying the disease indiscriminately. There are challenges in executing such an attack, but fanatical terrorist organizations seem to have an endless supply of willing suicide attackers. All this leads to the most important characteristic of bioviolence: It raises incomparable levels of panic. Contagious bioviolence means that planes fly empty or perhaps don’t fly at all. People cancel vacation and travel plans and refuse to interact with each other for fear of unseen affliction. Public entertainment events are canceled; even going to a movie becomes too dangerous. Ultimately, bioviolence is about hiding our children as everyone becomes vulnerable to our most fundamental terror: the fear of disease. </span>__For people who seek to **rattle the pillars of modern civilization** and__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">perhaps</span> __**cause it to collapse**, effective use of disease would set in motion political, economic, and health consequences so **severe as to call into question the ability of existing governments to maintain their citizens’ security**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In an attack’s wake, no one would know when it is over, and no government could credibly tell an anxious population where and when it is safe to resume normal life. While it is difficult to specify when this danger will strike, there should be no doubt that we are vulnerable to a rupture. Just as planes flying into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, instantly became a historical marker dividing strategic perspectives before from after, the day that disease is effectively used as an instrument of hate will profoundly change everything. </span>**__If you want to stop modern civilization in its tracks, bioviolence is the way to go__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The notion that no one will ever commit catastrophic bioviolence is simply untenable. What Can We Do? How can we confront these growing dangers? First, we must appreciate the global nature of the problem. Perpetrators from anywhere can get p a t h o g e n s f ro m v i r t u a l l y e v e r ywhe re . Biore s earch labs that onc e were concentrated in about two dozen developed states are proliferating, expanding the risk that lethal agents could be diverted and misused. The knowledge needed to weaponize pathogens is available on the Internet. An attack can be prep a r e d t h ro u g h e a s y n e tw o r k s o f transnational communication. Once a bioweapon is prepared, terrorists or other perpetrators from anywhere can slide across national boundaries and release disease anonymously. Once released, a contagious agent would spread without regard for boundaries, race, religion, or nationality. Public health responses would have to be internationally coordinated. New modes of international l egal coope rat ion would immediately be needed to investigate the crime. Thus, bioviolence dangers shrink the planet into an interdependent neighborhood. It makes no sense for any particular country to try to insulate its homeland from these dangers. No missile defense system will p ro t e c t u s f rom b i o v i o l e n c e . Improved border security will not keep disease at bay. National efforts to enhan c e m ed i ca l p repa redn e s s hav e virtues, but these defenses can be readily circumvented. To prevent bioviolence requires policies that focus on humanity as a species and that are implemented everywhere with centralized governance. Antibioviolence policies must be global. Ye t , advanc ing ant i -bioviol enc e policies is what the international community does worst. Bioviolence dangers are unnecessarily high because national and international antibioviolence strategies are gap-ridden, often incoherent, and not globally observed. As a result, we are all virtually naked in the face of unacceptable dangers. No ot her t hreat pre s ent s such a s tark cont ras t between severity of harm and a failure of leadership to reduce risks. Most important, existing institutional arrangements are inadequate. In sharp contrast to most other global security challenges, there is no responsible international authority that defines relevant prohibitions and responsibilities, implements policies over time, or evaluates whether obligations are being fulfilled. With regard to global bioviolence prevent i o n p o l i c i e s , t h e r e ’ s n o b o d y i n charge. No one is responsible; no one is accountable. The absence of authority is profoundly dangerous. Bioviolence prevention and preparedness requires a sizable orchestra, made up of various instruments, to play complicated music in harmony. Today, there is not a bad “conductor”, there is no conductor at all. The result is cacophony. Simply stated, bioviolence is the dark s ide of global izat ion, ye t int e rna tional alarms of bioviolence ring nowhere! We need a comprehensive national and international strategy for bioviol enc e prevent ion . [Se e box: “Five S t r a t e g i e s f o r P r e v e n t i n g B i oviolence,” page 30.] Policies should be pursued within an integrated approach that enables each policy to gain strength from all the others. Such policies are potentially available and effective, but they demand progressive changes in our global order. The Security Mission Global bioviolence prevention and preparedness policies are imperative, but also imperative is recognition that the world faces natural disease horrors. Where mass public health challenges are daily phenomena, the risks of terrorists using pathogens must be weighed against more tangible natural threats. Simply stated, it is illegitimate to insist that every nation adopt policies for preventing human-inflicted disease without acknowledging the silent genocide of natural disease that is responsible for millions of deaths. But neither is it legitimate to view bioviolence dangers as distractions from efforts to combat natural disease and therefore to put off beneficial measures until those afflictions are defeated. To do so frustrates forward movement on cost-effective initiatives that could help build an international security architecture for advancing science and health. Thus, bioviolence prevention must be a facet of a broad international commitment to: 1. Prevent the spread of disease ( e .g. , through publ i c -heal th measures). 2. Enhance protection against and cures for disease (e.g., through vaccination and drug therapies). 3. Supervise the conduct of biological science. 4. Criminalize unauthorized or improper use of pathogens. From this foundation should flow a policy commitment to the growth of bioscience as a global public good. Policies to encourage its worldwide spread deserve vigorous support. This governance mission should, therefore, be conceived as a global covenant . As bios c i enc e goe s forward as a fundamental pillar of human progress, all nations must undertake common responsibilities to prevent bioviolence even as the burdens associated with those responsibilities are differentiated according to wealth and capability. From everyone according to their abilities—to all for the benefit of all. The United Nations’ Importance The United Nations represents the b e s t venu e fo r a new gove rnanc e platform that can accommodate the need for an integrated global strategy agains t bioviol enc e . Only the United Nations has the necessary in ternational legitimacy, and only the Uni t ed Nat ions can int egrat e the many sectors—health, law enforcement, science, military, emergency preparedness—that must devote expertise and resources. A primary consideration here is to minimize any bureaucratic reshuffling. There is certainly no need to modify or replicate existing capabilities. Many relevant governance tasks are already addressed by one or more international organizations. For example, the World Health Organization should continue to be responsible for addressing the health implications of a pandemic, whether natural or malevolent. Interpol should continue to be responsible for a d d re s s i n g b i o v i o l e n c e ’ s l aw e nforcement implications. Indeed, the UN’s role should be only to coordinate the performance of these tasks. Broadly viewed, the United Nations should be able to undertake three functions: First, a specific UN agency should stimulate bioscience development by incorporating security concerns into the fabric of scientific undertakings and by assisting countries in using bioscience in ways that are consistent with policies for preventing bioviolence. Because science, development, and security can and must be mutually reinforcing, this agency’s primary responsibilities would be to promote and distribute knowledge and build capacity to fulfill obligations, especially in developing nations. Second, a UN office should coordinate activities among the relevant international/regional organizations, professional networks, and expert bodies. For example, three major international organizations focus on health (World Health Organization, Animal Health Organization, and the Food and Agriculture Organization); Interpol and Europol both focus on law enforcement; a large array of organizations focus on conveyance of dangerous items (e.g., International Maritime Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization). This UN office should be a steering mechanism to engage each of these orga nizations’ specialized expertise and to identify synergies. Third, a Security Council Committee should be authorized to investigate bioviolence preparations as well as respond and coordinate assistance to a bioviolence attack. Situations that call for investigation or response arise rarely, but they carry disproportionate significance for international peace and security. The Security Council Committee should not advance programmatic agendas, but it should be able to wield expertise and political muscle in volatile situations. Its primary mission would be to enable the international community to sustain global order in the face of a bioviolence challenge. Ever since someone harnessed a new technology to create a weapon with more devastating effects, there has been a link—a double helix—between the progress of science and the pursuit of security. This is inevitable. These dangers of bioviolence do not a rg u e f o r re l i n q u i s h i n g s c i e n t i f i c progress, but they disprove notions tha t n ew cha l l eng e s can b e e ff e ct ive ly addre s s ed wi th ye s t e rday’ s policies.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are, however, two technologies currently under development that may pose a more serious threat to human survival.

By the end of the next decade, global immunity to smallpox will likely be at a low unprecedented since the emergence of this disease in the distant past, while the opportunity for it to spread rapidly across the globe will be at an all time high. In the absence of other complications such as nuclear war near the peak of an epidemic, developed countries may respond with quarantine and vaccination to limit the damage. Otherwise mortality there may match the rate of 30 percent or more expected in unprepared developing countries. With respect to genetic engineering using currently available knowledge and technology, the simple expedient of spreading an ample mixture of </span>__coat protein variants could render a vaccination response **largely ineffective**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but this would otherwise not be expected to substantially increase overall mortality rates.

That is the subject of this book. Agronomists in the Philippines warned of what became known as southern corn leaf blight in 1061.' The disease was reported in Mexico not long after. In the summer of 1968, the first faint hint that the blight was in the United States came from seed growers in the Midwest. The danger was ignored. By the spring of 19701 the disease had taken hold in the Florida corn crop. But it was not until corn prices leapt thirty cents a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade that the world took notice; by then it was August—and too late. By the close of the year, Americans had lost fifteen percent of their most important crop—more than a billion bushels. Some southern states lost half their harvest and many of their farmers. While consumers suffered in the grocery stores, producers were out a billion dollars in lost yield. And the disaster was not solely domestic. U.S. seed exports may have spread the blight to Africa, Latin America and Asia.</span>





<span style="font-size: 12pt;">CBW attack causes nuclear war from retaliation</span>

Conley, USAF, “Not with Impunity: Assessing US Policy for Retaliating to a Chemical or Biological Attack”, Air & Space Power Journal - Spring 2003, [[http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj03/spr03/conley.html]]]</span>



<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The number of American casualties suffered due to a WMD attack may well be the most important variable in determining the nature of the US reprisal. A key question here is how many Americans would have to be killed to prompt a massive response by the United States. The bombing of marines in Lebanon, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 each resulted in a casualty count of roughly the same magnitude (150–300 deaths). Although these events caused anger and a desire for retaliation among the American public, they prompted no serious call for massive or nuclear retaliation. The body count from a single biological attack could easily be one or two orders of magnitude higher than the casualties caused by these events. Using the rule of proportionality as a guide, one could justifiably debate whether the United States should use massive force in responding to an event that resulted in only a few thousand deaths. However, what </span>__if the casualty count was around 300,000__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">? </span>__Such an unthinkable result__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from a single CBW incident </span>__is not beyond the realm of possibility__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: “According to the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, </span>__100 kg of anthrax spores delivered by an efficient aerosol generator on a large urban target would be between **two and six times as lethal** as a one megaton thermo-nuclear bomb__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”46 Would the deaths of 300,000 Americans be enough to trigger a nuclear response? </span>__In this case, proportionality **does not rule out** the use of nuclear weapons__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Net-Centric Warfare is essential to prevent nuclear war, deter aggression, make heg sustainable and prevents nuclear terrorism – low cost, quicker fighting force will be necessary in dominating the military sphere

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Arquilla 10</span> (John Arquilla, professor of defense analysis at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, MARCH/APRIL 2010, “The New Rules of War”, [[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/22/the_new_rules_of_war]])



In another sign of the gathering swarm, the August 2008 Russian incursion into Georgia, rather than being a blast from the Cold War past, heralded the possibility that more traditional armies can master the art of omnidirectional attack. In this instance, Russian regular forces were augmented by ethnic militias fighting all over the area of operations — <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and there was swarming in cyberspace at the same time. Indeed, the distributed denial of service attack, long a staple of cyberwarriors, is a model form of swarming</span>. And in this instance, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Georgian command and control was seriously disrupted by the hackers</span>. Simultaneous attack from several directions might be at the very cutting edge in conflict, but its lineage is quite old. Traditional tribal warfare, whether by nomadic horse archers or bush fighters, always featured some elements of swarms. The zenith of this kind of fighting probably came with the 13th-century Mongols, who had a name for this doctrine: “Crow Swarm.” When the attack was not carried out at close quarters by charging horsemen, but was instead conducted via arrows raining down on massed targets, the khans called it “Falling Stars.” With such tactics, the Mongols carved out the largest empire the world has ever seen, and kept it for a few centuries. But swarming was eclipsed by the rise of guns in the 15th century, which strongly favored massed volley fire. Industrial processes encouraged even more massing, and mechanization favored large flank maneuvers more than small swarms. Now again, in an age of global interdependence replete with advanced information technologies, even quite small teams of fighters can cause huge amounts of disruption. There is an old Mongol proverb: “With 40 men you can shake the world.” Look at what al Qaeda did with less than half that number on Sept. 11, 2001. This point was made by the great British strategist B.H. Liddell Hart in his biography of T.E. Lawrence, a master of the swarm in his own right. Liddell Hart, writing in 1935, predicted that at some point “the old concentration of force is likely to be replaced by an intangibly ubiquitous distribution of force — pressing everywhere, yet assailable nowhere.” Now, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">swarming is making a comeback, but at a time when few organized militaries are willing or able to recognize its return. </span>For the implications of this development — most notably, that fighting units in very small numbers can do amazing things if used to swarm — are profoundly destabilizing. The most radical change is this: Standing armies can be sharply reduced in size, if properly reconfigured and trained to fight in this manner. Instead of continually “surging” large numbers of troops to trouble spots, the basic response of a swarm force would be to go swiftly, in small numbers, and strike the attackers at many points. In the future, it will take a swarm to defeat a swarm. Almost 20 years ago, I began a debate about networks that blossomed into an unlikely friendship with Vice Adm. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Art Cebrowski, the modern strategic thinker most likely to be as well remembered as Alfred Thayer Mahan, the great American apostle of sea power. He was the first in the Pentagon power structure to warm to my notions of developing fighting networks, embracing the idea of opening lots of lateral communications links between “sensors and shooters</span>.” We disagreed, however, about the potential of networks. Cebrowski thought that “<span style="font-size: 12pt;">network-centric warfare” could be used to improve the performance of existing tools</span>— including aircraft carriers — for some time to come. I thought that networking implied a wholly new kind of navy, one made up of small, swift vessels, many of them remotely operated. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cebrowski</span>, who passed away in late 2005, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">clearly won this debate</span>, as <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the U.S. Navy remains heavily invested in being a “few-large” force — if one that is increasingly networked</span>. In an implicit nod to David Ronfeldt’s and my ideas, the Navy even has a Netwar Command now. Swarming has also gained some adherents. The most notable has been Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, who famously used swarm tactics in the last great Pentagon war game, “Millennium Challenge 2002,” to sink several aircraft carriers at the outset of the imagined conflict. But rather than accept that something quite radical was going on, the referees were instructed to “refloat” the carriers, and the costly game — its price tag ran in the few hundred millions — continued. Van Riper walked out. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Today, some in the U.S. military still pursue the idea of swarming, mostly in hopes of employing large numbers of small unmanned aerial vehicles in combat</span>. But military habits of mind and institutional interests continue to reflect a greater audience for surges than swarms. What //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">if senior military leaders wake up and decide to take networks and swarming absolutely seriously</span>//? If they ever do, //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">it is likely that the scourges of terrorism and aggression will become less a part of the world system</span>//. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Such a military would be smaller but quicker to respond, less costly but more lethal. The world system would become far less prone to many of the kinds of violence that have plagued it</span>. Networking and swarming are the organizational and doctrinal keys, respectively, to the strategic puzzle that has been waiting to be solved in our time. //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">A networked U.S. military</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">that knows how to swarm </span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">would have much smaller active manpower</span>//— easily two-thirds less than the more than 2 million serving today — but would be organized in hundreds more little units of mixed forces. //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The model for military intervention would be the 200 Special Forces “horse soldiers” who beat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan</span>//late in 2001. Such teams would deploy quickly and lethally, with ample reserves for relieving “first waves” and dealing with other crises. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">At sea, instead of concentrating firepower in a handful of large, increasingly vulnerable supercarriers, the U.S. Navy would distribute its capabilities across many hundreds of small craft armed with very smart weapons.</span> Given their stealth and multiple uses, submarines would stay while carriers would go. And in the air, the “wings” would reduce in size but increase in overall number, with mere handfuls of aircraft in each. Needless to say, networking means that these small pieces would still be able to join together to swarm enemies, large or small. Is such a shift feasible? Absolutely. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Big reductions in the U.S. military are nothing new. The massive demobilization after World War II aside, active forces were reduced 40 percent in the few years after the Vietnam War and by another third right after the end of the Cold War</span>. But the key is not so much in cutting as it is in redesigning and rethinking. But what happens if the status quo prevails and the potential of this new round of changes in strategic affairs is ignored or misinterpreted? Failure awaits, at ruinous cost. //<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The most likely form catastrophe </span>////<span style="font-size: 12pt;">could take is that terrorist networks would stay on their feet long enough to acquire nuclear weapons</span>//. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Even a handful of warheads in Osama bin Laden’s hands would give him great coercive power, as a network cannot be targeted for retaliation</span> the same way a country can. Deterrence will lie in tatters. If there is ever to be a nuclear Napoleon, he will come from a terrorist network. Within the U.S. military, the danger is that senior commanders will fall back on a fatalism driven by their belief that both congressional and industrial leaders will thwart any effort at radical change. I have heard this objection countless times since the early 1990s, repeated mantra-like, all the way up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thus the mighty U.S. war machine is like a Gulliver trussed up by Lilliputian politicians and businessmen. The irony, however, is that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the U.S. military has never been in a better position to gain acceptance for truly transformational change. Neither party in Congress can afford to be portrayed as standing in the way of strategic progress, and so, whatever the Pentagon asks for, it gets.</span> As for <span style="font-size: 12pt;">defense contractors</span>, far from driving the agenda, they <span style="font-size: 12pt;">are much too willing to give their military customers exactly what they demand</span> (rather than, perhaps, something better). <span style="font-size: 12pt;">If the U.S. armed forces call for smaller, smarter weapons and systems to support swarming, they will get them. </span>Beyond the United States, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">other countries' security forces are beginning to think along the lines of "many and small," are crafting better ways to "find," and are learning to swarm. Chinese naval thought today is clearly moving in this direction. Russian ground forces are, too</span>. Needless to say, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">terrorist networks are still in the lead,</span> and not just al Qaeda. Hezbollah gave quite a demonstration of all three of the new rules of war in its summer 2006 conflict with Israel, a virtual laboratory test of nation versus network -- in which the network more than held its own. For the U.S. military, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">failing a great leap forward in self-awareness of the need for radical change, a downward budgetary nudge is probably the best approach</span> -- despite President Barack Obama's unwillingness to extend his fiscal austerity program to security-related expenditures. This could take the form of a freeze on defense spending levels, to be followed by several years of, say, 10 percent annual reductions. To focus the redesign effort, a moratorium would be declared on all legacy-like systems (think aircraft carriers, other big ships, advanced fighters, tanks, etc.) while they are subjected to searching review. It should not be assumed that the huge sums invested in national defense have been wisely spent. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">To most Americans who think that being strong on defense means devoting more resources and building bigger systems, this suggestion to cut spending will sound outrageous</span>. But <span style="font-size: 12pt;">being smarter about defense might lower costs even as effectiveness improves. This pattern has held throughout the transformations of the last few decades, whether in farming or in industry. Why should the military be exempt? </span>There's real urgency to this debate. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Not only has history not ended with the Cold War and the advent of commerce-driven globalization, but conflict and violence have persisted -- even grown -- into a new postmodern scourge. </span>Indeed, it is ironic that, in an era in which the attraction to persuasive "soft power" has grown dramatically, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">coercive "hard power" continues to dominate in world affairs. This is no surprise in the case of rogue nations hellbent on developing nuclear arsenals to ensure their security, nor when it comes to terrorist networks that think their essential nature is revealed in and sustained by violent acts.</span> But <span style="font-size: 12pt;">this primary reliance on coercive capabilities is also on display across a range of countries great and small, most notably the United States, whose defense policy has over the past decade largely become its foreign policy. From the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to simmering crises with North Korea and Iran, and on to longer-range strategic concerns about East Asian and Central European security, the United States today is heavily invested in hard-power solutions. And it will continue to be. But if the radical adjustments in strategy, organization, and doctrine implied by the new rules of war are ignored, Americans will go on spending more and getting less when it comes to national defense</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">.</span>**</span>**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Networks will persist until they have the capability to land nuclear blows</span>**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">.Other countries will leapfrog ahead of the United States militarily, and concepts like "deterrence" and "containment" of aggression will blow away like leaves in the wind. </span>So it has always been. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Every era of technological change has resulted in profound shifts in military and strategic affairs</span>. History tells us that <span style="font-size: 12pt;">these developments were inevitable, but soldiers and statesmen were almost always too late in embracing them -- and tragedies upon tragedies ensued. There is still time to be counted among the exceptions</span>, like the Byzantines who, after the fall of Rome, radically redesigned their military and preserved their empire for another thousand years. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The U.S. goal should be to join the ranks of those who, in their eras, caught glimpses of the future and acted in time to shape it, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">saving the world from darkness</span>**</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span>

Barnes is a senior editor at U.S. News & World Report, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">11</span> [“Drone Targets Yemeni Cleric” WSJ, May 7, [[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703992704576307594129219756.html]]]

The U.S. launched a drone strike in Yemen on Thursday aimed at killing Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born radical cleric suspected of orchestrating terrorist attacks in the U.S, but he evaded the missile, Yemeni and U.S. officials said. The attack came days after a U.S. Navy SEALs team killed Osama bin Laden at a compound in Pakistan. Had Thursday's strike succeeded, the U.S. would have killed two of the most-wanted terrorists in a week. Mr. Awlaki has emerged as a leading charismatic front-man of <span style="font-size: 12pt;">al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a group the U.S. considers the world's most active terror organization.</span> With bin Laden's death, some officials believe Mr. Awlaki and the <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yemen-based group now represent the gravest threat to the U.S</span>. He has been linked to at least three major incidents: the Ft. Hood shootings, the Christmas 2009 plot to blow up a U.S.-bound passenger plane and a plan to blow up cargo planes. The attack appears to be unrelated to intelligence information taken in the raid that killed bin Laden, whose death was confirmed by al Qaeda Friday in a statement that vowed to continue attacks on Americans. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Central Intelligence Agency has been ramping up its intelligence collection in Yemen in recent months and works closely with Saudi intelligence</span>. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been more forthcoming with information on Mr. Awlaki since the president has faced major protests in his country, a U.S. official said. Mr. Saleh has sought to use that information in an effort to gain more U.S. support, the official added. The White House has backed an Arab proposal that would ease Mr. Saleh from office. The Yemen strike sends a clear message that despite turmoil in the Middle East and the success of the bin Laden operation, the U.S. is resolved to ratchet up a campaign against Mr. Awlaki and other members of his group. The attempt to kill Mr. Awlaki was the first known U.S. military strike inside Yemen since May 2010, when U.S. missiles mistakenly killed one of Mr. Saleh's envoys and an unknown number of other people. That soured relations and prompted the administration to pull back. U.S. strikes between December 2009 and May 2010 were carried out by U.S. military aircraft and cruise missiles, not the kind of armed drones used in Thursday's attack. The last known strike by an unmanned aircraft in Yemen was conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency in 2002. According to a Yemeni account of Thursday's strike, the U.S. launched two separate attacks within 45 minutes aimed at Mr. Awlaki in the southern province of Shebwa, which is considered an AQAP stronghold. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">The strike was conducted by the U.S. military, but the operation—like the bin Laden raid—appears to have benefitted from close cooperationbetween the Department of Defense, the CIA and Yemeni officials</span>. In the first strike, the U.S. fired three rockets at a pickup truck in which Mr. Awlaki and a Saudi national and suspected al Qaeda member were traveling outside the village of Jahwa, located some 20 miles away from the Shebwa provincial capital, said local residents and the Yemeni security official. Those missiles didn't hit their target. Two Yemeni brothers, who were known by local residents for giving shelter to al Qaeda militants, rushed to the scene of the attack. Mr. Awlaki switched vehicles with them, leaving the two Yemenis in the pickup. A single drone then hit the pickup truck, killing the Yemenis inside. Mr. Awlaki escaped in the other vehicle along with the Saudi. A Yemeni defense ministry official identified the two dead men as Musaid Mubarak Al-Daghari and his brother Abdullah.Unlike the bin Laden raid, which was carried out without Pakistani knowledge, the Yemeni government was a participant. "The Yemeni government gave the U.S. authorities vital details of Awlaki's whereabouts in Shabwa days ago," said a senior Yemeni security official. The official said the Yemeni government had full knowledge of the attack ahead of the U.S. strike. U.S. counterterrorism officials have been worried in recent weeks that the unrest in Yemen, and Mr. Saleh's increasingly weak position, had given a free hand to AQAP to plot fresh attacks against the West. In the past several weeks, more than half of the U.S.-trained and funded Yemeni counter-terrorism forces assigned to Shebwa have left their posts. Many have been ordered to redploy in the capital, where Mr. Saleh has been besieged by thousands of protesters and army units which have defected from his command. The timing of the Awlaki attack appears to be a calculated move by the Yemeni president to prove his counter-terrorism credentials to international allies like America and Saudi Arabia, which have been involved in intense diplomatic negotiations to get him to step down from office. Mr. Awlaki has been on the run from Yemeni authorities since the failed Christmas 2009 underwear bomber attempted to blow up a U.S.-bound passenger plane. He was living under the protection of his extended tribe and regional intelligence officials have criticized what they have seen as a lack of resolve by Yemeni security officials to pursue Mr. Awlaki. The Yemeni security official said Friday that his government believed that Awlaki had been hiding in Abdan village for approximately two weeks. The official said that the Yemeni government shared this intelligence with their U.S. counterparts on Wednesday. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">U.S. officials say finding Mr. Awlaki and other senior AQAP leaders has proven difficult.</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The U.S. lacks a robust intelligence network on the ground and the U.S.-born cleric has ditched electronic communications in favor of hard-to-track couriers to relay messages</span>//<span style="font-size: 12pt;">,</span> officials said.

NCW impossible without TSATs – space is key

<span style="color: #094b98;">B</span>y all accounts, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the success of the Pentagon’s ambitious plan to transform the U.S. military into a network-centric force is riding on the</span> transformational satellite communications system (<span style="font-size: 12pt;">T-Sat</span>) now in development. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Defense planners are convinced that full-scale military transformation and network-centric operations will be impossible to achieve without the spaceborne communications that the revolutionary T-Sat constellation would provide.The military has begun its transition to highly mobile, fast-reaction, quick-strike, netcentric forces that include increasing numbers of autonomous or semiautonomous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).It</span> therefore <span style="font-size: 12pt;">requires ultrareliable, superswift communications among all sorts of sensor systems, weapons platforms, and command posts in the air, on land, and at sea around the globe. T-Sats will be the space element</span>,<span style="font-size: 12pt;">and the sine qua non, of the military’s planned GIG </span>(global information grid)—its “Internet in the sky.” <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thus the T-Sat system is seen as “the cornerstone of [the Defense Dept.’s] future information operations</span>,” <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the “centerpiece of our future global communications network,” and “the heart of the DOD net-centric operations environment concept essential to all future operations,”</span> a Pentagon document proclaims.

John J. <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Garstka</span>, assistant director for concepts and operations in the Office of Force Transformation, Office of the Secretary of Defense. He has spoken and written extensively on the topic of warfare in the information age, 20<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">03</span> [“Network-Centric Warfare Offers Warfighting Advantage”, Signal Online, May, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=235&zoneid=62]]</span>, mcG]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Datalinks are the new weapon of the information age</span>. The term network-centric warfare broadly describes the combination of emerging tactics, techniques and procedures that a networked force can employ to create a decisive warfighting advantage. According to John Keegan, author of A History of Warfare, it is similar to the significant warfighting developments of the industrial age and agrarian age in that <span style="font-size: 16px;">network-centric warfare seeks to exploit an order of magnitude change in an underlying source of power to increase warfighting advantage dramatically.</span>Paula Kaufman, in an article she wrote for IEEE Spectrum, agrees with this opinion<span style="font-size: 16px;">. In the industrial age, power was primarily derived from mass and the sources of power for moving mass. In the information age, power is increasingly derived from information sharing, information access and speed,</span> she says. The advantages network-centric warfare brings to the battlespace are particularly relevant to the tactical and operational levels of war, but they impact all levels of military activity from the tactical to the strategic. Although <span style="font-size: 16px;">the construct of an information advantage may seem somewhat intangible, it can be measured, and its impact on military operations can be evaluated in terms of mission effectiveness, survivability and lethality</span>—coins of the realm used by warfighters across the ages. Evidence of the power of network-centric warfare accumulated from a wide range of activities, including combat operations, training events, exercises and demonstrations, continues to strengthen and reinforce its existing tenets. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A U.S. Defense Department 2001 report to Congress about network-centric warfare enumerates several specific points: A robustly networked force improves information sharing; information sharing and collaboration enhances the quality of information and shared situational awareness; shared situational awareness enables collaboration and self-synchronization and enhances sustainability and speed of command; and these in turn dramatically increase mission effectiveness. </span>Although the margin of victory has varied across mission areas, the outcome has consistently been decisive in favor of forces that are robustly networked. In some tactical engagements, <span style="font-size: 16px;">superior platforms were decisively defeated by less capable platforms that leveraged the order of magnitude improvement in information sharing that networking enables.</span> In other engagements, digitized and networked ground forces with a reduced number of platforms were able to substitute information for mass and outperform units that had fought with a larger number of platforms not similarly digitized and networked. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Even more impressive, the combination of networked and digitized ground and air forces was able to defeat an opposition force decisively with unprecedented lethality by creating and leveraging an information advantage</span>. Most recently, military operations in support of operation Enduring Freedom highlighted the emergence of near-real-time information sharing as a source of warfighting advantage. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The source of power was not new platforms, but rather the networking of the legacy platforms with special operations forces</span> (SOF). The extent to which ground-based SOF were able to share precision information with command and control aircraft and fighter, bomber and attack aircraft was unprecedented in military operations. It represented an order of magnitude increase in information sharing over what had been previously demonstrated anywhere in the world in combat operations. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Two of the more noteworthy and documented examples of the power of network-centric warfare are drawn from the air-to-air mission. In this mission area, a major contributor to enhanced survivability and lethality is an increase in shared situational awareness</span> and enhanced situational understanding. With audio-only communications, p<span style="font-size: 16px;">ilots and controllers must share information</span>generated by onboard sensors about opposing forces as well as their own position and status via voice. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Communicating the minimum essential information required to take offensive or defensive actions takes time, and the resulting situational awareness can often differ significantly from reality</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">In contrast, when datalinks are employed on fighter aircraft, digital information on blue and red forces is shared instantaneously, enabling all participants to share a common tactical picture. This improved information position constitutes a significant information advantage vis-à-vis an adversary fighting with voice-only communications. This information advantage in turn enables a cognitive advantage in the form of dramatically increased shared situational awareness and enhanced situational understanding. The result is that pilots flying datalink-equipped aircraft can achieve much higher levels of shared situational awareness and understanding on a timeline previously unachievable with voice-only communications. They can translate these advantages into increased survivability and lethality. One of the best examples of how networking and digitization can be leveraged to create an information advantage took place in a training exercise in the mid-1990s when Royal Air Force (RAF) Tornado aircraft from U.K. 29 Squadron with tactical datalinks defeated U.S. Air Force F-15Cs with voice-only communications in a series of air-to-air engagements that took place during a red flag exercise in the airspace over the Nellis Air Force Base range. Historically, the most favorable outcome that the absolute best RAF pilots could manage when flying against F-15Cs was a draw. However, when the RAF introduced a datalink in the form of Link-16, U.K. 29 Squadron pilots, flying with new innovative tactics, were able to increase their kill ratio over the F-15C equipped with voice-only communications to approximately 4-to-1. The power of information sharing to increase survivability and lethality in the air-to-air mission was substantiated by the Air Force again in the mid-1990s during a joint tactical information distribution system (JTIDS) operational special project. Air Force pilots flying F-15Cs with and without datalinks clearly demonstrated an order of magnitude increase in information sharing enabled by the datalinks. This operational special project consisted of hundreds of tactical engagements, ranging in size from two-versus-two to eight-versus-16 aircraft, which were conducted during day and night conditions. During the more than 12,000 sorties and more than 19,000 flying hours, the average kill ratio for F-15Cs equipped with datalinks increased by more than 150 percent over F-15Cs fighting with voice-only communications, according to a JTIDS operational special project report to Congress. An analysis of the growing body of evidence highlights a very strong relationship between information advantage, cognitive advantage and increased lethality and survivability at the tactical level. It shows that these relationships are not unique to the air-to-air mission but rather that they were demonstrated first in this mission area as a result of the relative maturity of the application of networking technology in this arena. This same story line of increased warfighting effectiveness enabled by networking has been played out in counter special operations forces mission Fleet Battle Experiment Delta; counter anti-access, Fleet Battle Experiment Foxtrot; multinational rapid reaction forces, Allied Command Europe Mobile Force–Land; and combined arms maneuver warfare, Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I (DCX-I). During DCX-I, the blue force was digitized and networked to an unprecedented degree. Equally important, these forces were highly trained on this digital equipment and in many cases had developed new tactics, techniques and procedures to leverage their improved capability to operate in the information domain.</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">The digitized and networked ground forces demonstrated significantly improved warfighting capabilities and were able to prevail over the opposing forces in a number of engagements</span>. <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">For example, during one phase of the exercise, the blue force was in a defensive posture with the opposing force moving to contact under the cover of darkness. A significant column of armor was detected by the joint surveillance target attack radar system and positively identified as hostile by a Hunter unmanned aerial vehicle, Col. Fred Stein, USA (Ret.), explains. An analysis of the real-time blue ground picture indicated that the attacking opposing force column was located approximately 10 miles from the brigade combat team’s defensive positions. The brigade commander, in consultation with the division commander, decided to engage the hostile force, and the fire mission was assigned to close air support. At this point, the engagement departed from the usual script, which had been characterized in the past by some as an exercise in futility, according to an internal correspondence from the Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Test Center. F-16s and A/OA-10s of the Arizona Air National Guard equipped with the situational awareness data link (SADL) performed a close-air-support mission. The networking of these aircraft enabled them to exchange real-time targeting information as well as to receive and display a forward trace of the blue ground picture. The result of this networking was more than an order of magnitude improvement in the ability of ground and air forces to share information. In addition to being equipped with SADL, the F-16s were equipped with Lightening II targeting pods and a mixed weapons load of GBU-12s and AGM-65D Mavericks. The Forward Air Controller–Airborne (FAC-A) determined that employing the F-16s as a coordinated pair would maximize combat power. In engaging the ground targets, the A/OA-10 FAC-A identified targets of interest and distributed sensor points of interest over SADL to facilitate sensor cueing by the F-16’s Lightening II targeting pod. Employing these tactics enabled each wave of two-ship pairs to engage tanks selectively and avoid dropping ordnance on less significant targets. The battle damage assessment of the first wave of F-16s was “two battalions rendered combat ineffective.” Follow-on flights of F-16s were equally lethal, according to the Air National Guard correspondence.</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">The net result of this engagement was that this phase of the training exercise had to be recocked to enable ground forces to accomplish their training objectives for hasty defense and counterattack successfully, </span>Col. Stein says. This transformation of close air support at night from an exercise in futility to devastatingly effective combat highlights the efficacy of network-centric warfare. The impact of digitization and networking on the combined arms fight, specifically the impact of digital close air support, is described in an Army evaluation of DCX-I. “The National Training Center is a playing field that often humbles the visiting team,” it reports. “However, during the U.S. Army’s Division Capstone Exercise–Phase I, the visiting team, in the form of the U.S. Army’s 4th Infantry Division, supported by elements of the U.S. Air Force, including elements of the Arizona Air National Guard, were able to leverage the power of an order of magnitude increase in information sharing to turn the tables on the opposing forces on at least two occasions. Of particular significance was a devastating defeat of opposing forces at night by F-16 and A/OA-10 aircraft performing the close-air-support mission.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Worldwide, militaries are crafting their individual responses to the challenges and opportunities of the information age. They are taking actions that demonstrate an increased understanding of the sources of information age warfighting advantage</span>. A new vocabulary has developed that reflects the subtle variations in underlying strategies and core missions of militaries worldwide. To varying degrees, these actions also are reflected in emerging concepts and doctrine, focused investments in key enablers and well-crafted programs of experimentation. Besides network-centric warfare, currently used by the armed forces of the United States, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, other coined terms include Australia’s network-enabled warfare, the United Kingdom’s network-enabled capability, the Swedish armed forces’ network-based defense and the armed forces of the Republic of Singapore’s knowledge-based command and control. Each of these terms reflects its respective military’s ongoing response to the information age. Clearly, militaries worldwide are continuing to take a close look at network-centric warfare and related concepts for information age warfare. Evidently they like what they see.

At risk also is <span style="font-size: 16px;">the development of the Transformational Satellite Communications program, or TSAT, an Air Force project that is supposed to work with Future Combat Systems.</span> The Defense Department is planning to cut about $4 billion of the TSAT budget over the next five years, partly because of congressional concerns about an expensive and technical project that already has been cut, delayed and restructured. The Air Force has yet to select a contractor for the project, though Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the two leading contenders, have both been working on development contracts. <span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT would be about 100 times faster than military satellites in orbit now, Air Force officials say. That's to an extent because the satellites would take advantage of the latest Internet technology to reroute communications traffic more efficiently, they say</span>. //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">TSAT </span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">is expected to also provide more securely encrypted communications for Future Combat Systems to prevent enemies from intercepting or jamming signals</span>//. Until recently, military officials said the program would launch its first satellite in 2016, though now they say the schedule is uncertain. According to a 2006 report, the GAO said TSAT began without sufficiently mature technology, noting that costs have increased and the timetable has been delayed. Before the latest cutbacks, according to the Air Force, the program had increased by about $8 billion, or 50 percent, to $24 billion, including inflation. The new cutbacks will defer work, delaying the timetable and adding to the program's overall expense because of "the costs associated with extending the contract to perform necessary work," the military said. But Richard Pino, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the Air Force's TSAT program director, said "the technologies are all at the right levels of maturity."</span> Boeing's Muilenburg said the prospect of additional cuts should not pose a problem for Future Combat Systems. In lieu of TSAT, he said that the Army program could use current military and commercial satellites. Loren B. Thompson, a defense consultant at the Lexington Institute, a public policy think tank, said, however, that <span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT "is crucial to the secure networking capabilities that underpin" Future Combat Systems. Given the cutbacks, he said, "If TSAT collapses, which looks like a distinct possibility, soldiers may have to rely on links that are harder to access on the move, more vulnerable to jamming and interceptions, and offer nowhere near as much bandwidth</span>." Cristina Chaplain, who oversees the GAO's review of space systems, also said that //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">"TSAT was being designed to support communications on the move, whereas other programs don't do that to the extent that's needed by" Future Combat Systems</span>//. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sorenson, the Army's chief information officer, <span style="font-size: 16px;">acknowledges that the development of TSAT and the other complementary programs represent a "high risk," but he said the military is attempting to manage that risk by developing the programs incrementally</span>. Rickey E. Smith, <span style="font-size: 16px;">a retired Army colonel who is part of the military team designing how Future Combat Systems will be used, said that if the complementary programs fail, the Army project would certainly be impacted, but so would other military services that depend on these technologies. </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">And he said that while the GAO does good work, "They've never seen a program they liked</span>//." For the GAO's Francis, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the question for his team of investigators is not whether they like these military programs but whether they will work in concert with Future Combat Systems.</span>

Now that the literature review is complete, it is possible to investigate the potential of NCW. This author has not found any proponents of NCW touting that this concept is the “Silver Bullet” to solve all the problems of future warfare. Many of the same problems that have plagued warfighters in the past exist today and will exist in the future: fog and friction, competing advances in technologies, the unpredictable nature of human behavior on the battlefield, and asymmetric warfare to name only a few. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The issue isn’t the existence of these challenges to modern warfare but how one exploits the advantages of information to mitigate risk and take advantage of strengths in the force to achieve objectives</span>. 35 Are the potential benefits of NCW worth the opportunity costs associated with aggressively moving forward with the implementation of this new concept? <span style="font-size: 16px;">The concept of Network Centric Warfare has already moved beyond the “bumper sticker” stage. NCW is not a fad that will go quietly into the night. There is little doubt that DOD is spending significant finite resources to pursue NCW capabilities</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">DOD costs in the area of military electronics, aircraft avionics, vetronics, and missile guidance, communications, electro-optics is approaching $99.57 billion in</span> the <span style="font-size: 16px;">2010</span>. 36 <span style="font-size: 16px;">There may be changes to terminology, shifts in policy, and alterations in implementation plans. However, the </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">core concepts that relate to leveraging the power of information will remain</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">. The DOD and senior military leaders have been consistent yet cautious in their support of a networked force.</span> Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld concisely stated the importance a fully networked force in the Transformation Planning Guidance, “<span style="font-size: 16px;">We must achieve: fundamentally joint, network-centric</span>, distributed <span style="font-size: 16px;">forces</span> capable of rapid decision superiority and massed effects across the operational environment. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Realizing these capabilities will require transforming our people, processes, and military forces.”</span> 37 ADM <span style="font-size: 16px;">Giambastiani</span>, former Commander U.S. Joint Forces Command <span style="font-size: 16px;">stated</span>, “<span style="font-size: 16px;">A fully collaborative and networked force is an imperative, not a luxury.” </span>38 The former Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, General Michael Haggee said, “The capability to connect disparate units spread over the battlefield will help to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance to commanders who can then call in fire support…Information Technology (IT) will also be critical to Sea Basing, a key component of the Navy’s Sea Power 21 Concept.” 39 Vice Chief of Staff, U.S. Army Gen. Peter Chiarelli recently stated, “Access to information can mean the difference between living and dying.” 40 General William Wallace, USA (Ret.) goes on to caution that “despite the enormous benefits of using a network, it would be folly to lose sight of the fact that it is still merely a tool to aid the commander in understanding and decision making.” 41 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates wrote in his recent Foreign Affairs article, We should be modest about what military force can accomplish and what technology can accomplish. The advances in precision, sensor, information, and satellite technologies have led to extraordinary gains in what the U.S. military can do. The Taliban were dispatched within three months; Saddam’s regime was toppled in three weeks. A button can be pushed in Nevada, and seconds later a pickup truck will explode in Mosul. A bomb dropped from the sky can destroy a targeted house while leaving the one next to it intact. But no one should ever neglect the psychological, cultural, political, and human dimensions of warfare. 42 //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">The question is not if DOD will proceed with NCW, but how.</span>//

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Net-Centric Warfare is key to prevent terrorism and sustain hegemony - </span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Arquilla 10</span> (John Arquilla, professor of defense analysis at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, MARCH/APRIL 2010, “The New Rules of War”, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/22/the_new_rules_of_war)

In another sign of the gathering swarm, the August 2008 Russian incursion into Georgia, rather than being a blast from the Cold War past, heralded the possibility that more traditional armies can master the art of omnidirectional attack. In this instance, Russian regular forces were augmented by ethnic militias fighting all over the area of operations — <span style="font-size: 16px;">and there was swarming in cyberspace at the same time. Indeed, the distributed denial of service attack, long a staple of cyberwarriors, is a model form of swarming</span>. And in this instance, <span style="font-size: 16px;">Georgian command and control was seriously disrupted by the hackers</span>. Simultaneous attack from several directions might be at the very cutting edge in conflict, but its lineage is quite old. Traditional tribal warfare, whether by nomadic horse archers or bush fighters, always featured some elements of swarms. The zenith of this kind of fighting probably came with the 13th-century Mongols, who had a name for this doctrine: “Crow Swarm.” When the attack was not carried out at close quarters by charging horsemen, but was instead conducted via arrows raining down on massed targets, the khans called it “Falling Stars.” With such tactics, the Mongols carved out the largest empire the world has ever seen, and kept it for a few centuries. But swarming was eclipsed by the rise of guns in the 15th century, which strongly favored massed volley fire. Industrial processes encouraged even more massing, and mechanization favored large flank maneuvers more than small swarms. Now again, in an age of global interdependence replete with advanced information technologies, even quite small teams of fighters can cause huge amounts of disruption. There is an old Mongol proverb: “With 40 men you can shake the world.” Look at what al Qaeda did with less than half that number on Sept. 11, 2001. This point was made by the great British strategist B.H. Liddell Hart in his biography of T.E. Lawrence, a master of the swarm in his own right. Liddell Hart, writing in 1935, predicted that at some point “the old concentration of force is likely to be replaced by an intangibly ubiquitous distribution of force — pressing everywhere, yet assailable nowhere.” Now, <span style="font-size: 16px;">swarming is making a comeback, but at a time when few organized militaries are willing or able to recognize its return. </span>For the implications of this development — most notably, that fighting units in very small numbers can do amazing things if used to swarm — are profoundly destabilizing. The most radical change is this: Standing armies can be sharply reduced in size, if properly reconfigured and trained to fight in this manner. Instead of continually “surging” large numbers of troops to trouble spots, the basic response of a swarm force would be to go swiftly, in small numbers, and strike the attackers at many points. In the future, it will take a swarm to defeat a swarm. Almost 20 years ago, I began a debate about networks that blossomed into an unlikely friendship with Vice Adm. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Art Cebrowski, the modern strategic thinker most likely to be as well remembered as Alfred Thayer Mahan, the great American apostle of sea power. He was the first in the Pentagon power structure to warm to my notions of developing fighting networks, embracing the idea of opening lots of lateral communications links between “sensors and shooters</span>.” We disagreed, however, about the potential of networks. Cebrowski thought that “<span style="font-size: 16px;">network-centric warfare” could be used to improve the performance of existing tools</span>— including aircraft carriers — for some time to come. I thought that networking implied a wholly new kind of navy, one made up of small, swift vessels, many of them remotely operated. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Cebrowski</span>, who passed away in late 2005, <span style="font-size: 16px;">clearly won this debate</span>, as <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S. Navy remains heavily invested in being a “few-large” force — if one that is increasingly networked</span>. In an implicit nod to David Ronfeldt’s and my ideas, the Navy even has a Netwar Command now. Swarming has also gained some adherents. The most notable has been Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, who famously used swarm tactics in the last great Pentagon war game, “Millennium Challenge 2002,” to sink several aircraft carriers at the outset of the imagined conflict. But rather than accept that something quite radical was going on, the referees were instructed to “refloat” the carriers, and the costly game — its price tag ran in the few hundred millions — continued. Van Riper walked out. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Today, some in the U.S. military still pursue the idea of swarming, mostly in hopes of employing large numbers of small unmanned aerial vehicles in combat</span>. But military habits of mind and institutional interests continue to reflect a greater audience for surges than swarms. What //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">if senior military</span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;"> leaders wake up and decide to take networks and swarming absolutely seriously</span>//? If they ever do, //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">it is likely that the scourges of terrorism and aggression will become less a part of the world system</span>//. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Such a military would be smaller but quicker to respond, less costly but more lethal. The world system would become far less prone to many of the kinds of violence that have plagued it</span>. Networking and swarming are the organizational and doctrinal keys, respectively, to the strategic puzzle that has been waiting to be solved in our time. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A networked U.S. military that knows how to swarm would have much smaller active manpower</span> — easily two-thirds less than the more than 2 million serving today — but would be organized in hundreds more little units of mixed forces. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The model for military intervention would be the 200 Special Forces “horse soldiers</span>” who beat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan late in 2001. Such teams would deploy quickly and lethally, with ample reserves for relieving “first waves” and dealing with other crises. <span style="font-size: 16px;">At sea, instead of concentrating firepower in a handful of large, increasingly vulnerable supercarriers, the U.S. Navy would distribute its capabilities across many hundreds of small craft armed with very smart weapons.</span> Given their stealth and multiple uses, submarines would stay while carriers would go. And in the air, the “wings” would reduce in size but increase in overall number, with mere handfuls of aircraft in each. Needless to say, networking means that these small pieces would still be able to join together to swarm enemies, large or small. Is such a shift feasible? Absolutely. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Big reductions in the U.S. military are nothing new. The massive demobilization after World War II aside, active forces were reduced 40 percent in the few years after the Vietnam War and by another third right after the end of the Cold War</span>. But the key is not so much in cutting as it is in redesigning and rethinking. But what happens if the status quo prevails and the potential of this new round of changes in strategic affairs is ignored or misinterpreted? Failure awaits, at ruinous cost. //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">The most likely form catastrophe </span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">could take is that terrorist networks would stay on their feet long enough to acquire nuclear weapons</span>//. Even a handful of warheads in Osama bin Laden’s hands would give him great coercive power, as a network cannot be targeted for retaliation the same way a country can. Deterrence will lie in tatters. If there is ever to be a nuclear Napoleon, he will come from a terrorist network. Within the U.S. military, the danger is that senior commanders will fall back on a fatalism driven by their belief that both congressional and industrial leaders will thwart any effort at radical change. I have heard this objection countless times since the early 1990s, repeated mantra-like, all the way up to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thus the mighty U.S. war machine is like a Gulliver trussed up by Lilliputian politicians and businessmen. The irony, however, is that <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.</span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">S. military has never been in a better position to gain acceptance for truly transformational change</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">. Neither party in Congress can afford to be portrayed as standing in the way of strategic progress, and so, whatever the Pentagon asks for, it gets.</span> As for <span style="font-size: 16px;">defense contractors</span>, far from driving the agenda, they <span style="font-size: 16px;">are much too willing to give their military customers exactly what they demand</span> (rather than, perhaps, something better). <span style="font-size: 16px;">If the U.S. armed forces call for smaller, smarter weapons and systems to support swarming, they will get them. </span>Beyond the United States, <span style="font-size: 16px;">other countries' security forces are beginning to think along the lines of "many and small," are crafting better ways to "find," and are learning to swarm. Chinese naval thought today is clearly moving in this direction. Russian ground forces are, too</span>. Needless to say, <span style="font-size: 16px;">terrorist networks are still in the lead,</span> and not just al Qaeda. Hezbollah gave quite a demonstration of all three of the new rules of war in its summer 2006 conflict with Israel, a virtual laboratory test of nation versus network -- in which the network more than held its own. For the U.S. military, <span style="font-size: 16px;">failing a great leap forward in self-awareness of the need for radical change, a downward budgetary nudge is probably the best approach</span> -- despite President Barack Obama's unwillingness to extend his fiscal austerity program to security-related expenditures. This could take the form of a freeze on defense spending levels, to be followed by several years of, say, 10 percent annual reductions. To focus the redesign effort, a moratorium would be declared on all legacy-like systems (think aircraft carriers, other big ships, advanced fighters, tanks, etc.) while they are subjected to searching review. It should not be assumed that the huge sums invested in national defense have been wisely spent. <span style="font-size: 16px;">To most Americans who think that being strong on defense means devoting more resources and building bigger systems, this suggestion to cut spending will sound outrageous</span>. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">being smarter about defense might lower costs even as effectiveness improves. This pattern has held throughout the transformations of the last few decades, whether in farming or in industry. Why should the military be exempt? </span>There's real urgency to this debate. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Not only has history not ended with the Cold War and the advent of commerce-driven globalization, but conflict and violence have persisted -- even grown -- into a new postmodern scourge. </span>Indeed, it is ironic that, in an era in which the attraction to persuasive "soft power" has grown dramatically, <span style="font-size: 16px;">coercive "hard power" continues to dominate in world affairs. This is no surprise in the case of rogue nations hellbent on developing nuclear arsenals to ensure their security, nor when it comes to terrorist networks that think their essential nature is revealed in and sustained by violent acts.</span> But <span style="font-size: 16px;">this primary reliance on coercive capabilities is also on display across a range of countries great and small, most notably the United States, whose defense policy has over the past decade largely become its foreign policy. From the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to simmering crises with North Korea and Iran, and on to longer-range strategic concerns about East Asian and Central European security, the United States today is heavily invested in hard-power solutions. And it will continue to be. But if the radical adjustments in strategy, organization, and doctrine implied by the new rules of war are ignored, Americans will go on spending more and getting less when it comes to national defense</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">.</span>**</span>**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Networks will persist until they have the capability to land nuclear blows</span>**<span style="font-size: 16px;">.Other countries will leapfrog ahead of the United States militarily, and concepts like "deterrence" and "containment" of aggression will blow away like leaves in the wind. </span>So it has always been. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Every era of technological change has resulted in profound shifts in military and strategic affairs</span>. History tells us that <span style="font-size: 16px;">these developments were inevitable, but soldiers and statesmen were almost always too late in embracing them -- and tragedies upon tragedies ensued. There is still time to be counted among the exceptions</span>, like the Byzantines who, after the fall of Rome, radically redesigned their military and preserved their empire for another thousand years. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The U.S. goal should be to join the ranks of those who, in their eras, caught glimpses of the future and acted in time to shape it, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">saving the world from darknes</span>****<span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">s.</span>**</span>

In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question “Is Nuclear War Inevitable??” In Section , Moore points out what most <span style="font-size: 16px;">terrorists</span>obviously already <span style="font-size: 16px;">know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange</span>. As Moore points out, <span style="font-size: 16px;">all</span> that militant <span style="font-size: 16px;">terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb</span> and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Because of the Russian “dead hand” system, “where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,” it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States</span>” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Israeli leaders</span> and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it <span style="font-size: 16px;">would retaliate with the suicidal “Samson option</span>” against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even “anti-Semitic” European cities In that case, of course, <span style="font-size: 16px;">Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of </span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">nuclear warheads</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">,</span> many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, <span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">would rain </span>upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radi<span style="font-size: 16px;">oactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations </span>in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And <span style="font-size: 16px;">what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Any accident, mistaken communication, false signal or “lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason could, in a matter of a few minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons</span>, and once a weapon is used, then the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is actually less probable since <span style="font-size: 16px;">each country would act under the “use them or lose them” strategy and psychology</span>; restraint by one power would be interpreted as a weakness by the other, which could be exploited as a window of opportunity to “win” the war. In other words, <span style="font-size: 16px;">once Pandora's Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them</span>. Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, “everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self-determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors” In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and once even just one is used, it is very likely that many, if not all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of much of human civilization while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter. In “Scenarios,” Moore summarizes the various ways a nuclear war could begin: <span style="font-size: 16px;">Such a war could start through a reaction to terrorist attacks, or through the need to protect against overwhelming military opposition</span>, or through the use of small battle field tactical nuclear weapons meant to destroy hardened targets. It might quickly move on to the use of strategic nuclear weapons delivered by short-range or inter-continental missiles or long-range bombers. These could deliver high altitude bursts whose electromagnetic pulse knocks out electrical circuits for hundreds of square miles. Or they could deliver nuclear bombs to destroy nuclear and/or non-nuclear military facilities, nuclear power plants, important industrial sites and cities. Or it could skip all those steps and start through the accidental or reckless use of strategic weapons

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The nuclear taboo is a</span> kind <span style="font-size: 16px;">of international norm and this type of norm is supported by the promotion of the norm through international social exchange.But at present the increased </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">threat of nuclear terrorism has lowered people’s confidence that nuclear weapons will not be used</span>//. <span style="font-size: 16px;">China and the United States have a broad common interest in combating nuclear terrorism.Using technical and institutional measures to break the foundation of nuclear terrorism and lessen the possibility of a nuclear terrorist attack can not only weaken the danger of nuclear terrorism itself but also </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">strengthen people’s confidence in the nuclear taboo</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">, and in this way preserve an international environment beneficial to both China and the United States.In this way </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">even if there is crisis</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">in China-U.S. relations caused by conflict, the nuclear taboo can also help both countries reduce suspicions about the nuclear weapons problem, </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">avoid miscalculation and thereby reduce the danger of a nuclear war</span>//**.**

Thanks to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the wars they spawned, <span style="font-size: 16px;">many people around the world think they're living through the most dangerous, violent and strategically uncertain period in human history.Well, that simply isn't true, as the most recent Human Security Report from Canada's Simon Fraser University makes clear.</span> Entitled, "<span style="font-size: 16px;">The Causes of Peace and the Shrinking Costs of War," the 2009-2010 edition of the annual report </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">marshals a ton of solid data that proves our world is less violent than ever </span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">and that it has "become far less insecure over the past 20 years." </span>//The major failing of this otherwise brilliant report is its refusal to give America any credit for this historic shift, which the authors credit to NATO and the United Nations as the "international community" of note. But before addressing that lapse, let me focus on the unabashedly good news. First, classic //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">interstate warfare continues to decline</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">. If in the 1950s we suffered an average of 6 to 7 interstate or international wars per year, now we're down to less than one-- despite the number of states in the world having roughly doubled across those six decades</span>. Though the report notes //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">the complete absence of great-power war </span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">since 1945</span>//, it repeatedly refuses to adequately credit nuclear weapons on that score. //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">War, the "eternal scourge," apparently went the way of the dinosaur once America achieved nuclear superpower status and exerted itself globally,</span>// but the report pretends it was all the U.N.'s doing -- kind of like crediting the referee with winning the game. Second, since the Cold War ended//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">, civil wars have started dropping in frequency as well, with the worst ones -- 1,000 or more dead in a year -- declining by more than two-thirds</span>//. So //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">not only are there fewer wars, they are less lethal.</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">The average international war of the 1950s killed 20,000 people a year. Today, that number stands at less than 3,000. </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">Not bad for a</span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">world allegedly suffering "uncontrollable" WMD proliferation and "perpetual war." </span>//Third, //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">the biggest theater of war</span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">fare and killing since World War II has been Asia.</span>// Initially, there was China's civil war and Mao's murderous rule, then the Korean bloodletting followed by Vietnam, where 300,000 died in 1972 alone. But //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">in 2008, the region suffered less than 1,000 "battle deaths</span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">."</span>// The report's tentative academic judgment here confirms what any historian of modern globalization knows as fact: "East Asia's post-Vietnam history appears to support claims that //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">rising incomes lead to fewer wars</span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">." </span>//It should come as no surprise that, <span style="font-size: 16px;">as East Asia spent the past several decades successfully joining the global economy, warfare disappeared</span>. //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">But how do all these great powers rise simultaneously without turning on each other militarily? Might there have been some extra-regional military Leviathan that provided the "glue" for this unprecedented regional dynamic</span>//? Or was this the work of the United Nations? Fourth, while <span style="font-size: 16px;">the frequency of subnational violence -- whether involving the state or strictly between subnational communities -- has increased by a quarter since 2003, </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">the large bulk of these conflicts are low-intensity</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">, meaning fewer than 1,000 battle deaths in a year</span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">. So-called high-intensity conflicts -- more than 3 deaths a day -- have dropped globally in frequency by almost four-fifths since the end of the Cold War</span>//. This means that in a world of almost 7 billion people, //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">less than 30,000</span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;"> people are dying from warfare every year</span>//. //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">That puts the</span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;"> global scourge of "perpetual war" on par with male deaths due to lung cancer in India. </span>//But my personal favorite decline concerns <span style="font-size: 16px;">deaths from "one-sided violence," otherwise known as government militaries and/or nonstate armies slaughtering civilians</span>, which <span style="font-size: 16px;">were at their lowest in 2008 -- the latest year of record -- since researchers began keeping records in 1989. </span>Where has the vast majority of such killing occurred since Cold War's end? Africa. Which continent has experienced the greatest recent explosion of globalization connectivity and middle class emergence? That again would be Africa. Judging by Asia's experience over the past 35 years, that's good news. Finally//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">, what about the notion that wars are growing longer? Absolutely untrue</span>//, according to the report, which notes<span style="font-size: 16px;">, "In each decade since the 1970s, the percentage of conflicts that lasted 10 years or more has declined." </span>Again, //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">the dominant global trend </span>//since the 1970s has been the stunning expansion of globalization, beginning with Deng Xiaoping's reforms in China. It turns out that this //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">isn't</span>// a case of "//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">perpetual war for </span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">perpetual peace"</span>// after all, //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">as many critics</span>// of my unabashedly pro-globalization vision //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">have </span>//long //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">alleged.</span>// Instead//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">, globalization and America's muscular support</span>// for its expansion just so happens to //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">coincide with the greatest reduction in global violence ever seen. </span>//As for the Human Security Report's prognosis on what lies ahead? "While the future remains impossible to predict and will surely deliver some unpleasant surprises as it has in the past<span style="font-size: 16px;">, there are </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">no </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">obvious countervailing system-level </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">forces</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">that appear powerful enough to </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">reverse the positive effects of the trends</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">we have identified." </span>Does that sound like a "post-American world" to you? Now on to my major gripe: The report credits the U.N. and the "international community" with the bulk of these developments. We are told repeatedly throughout the text that the key system-level development that unleashed all this peace was the end of the Cold War, which did bring an end to the superpower proxy wars in the Third World. But let's be clear about one thing: <span style="font-size: 16px;">While the Soviet Union's military left the playing field, America's did not. Compared to the 1980s, America's crisis-response activity quadrupled in the 1990s, as measured in crisis-response days put in by the U.S. Marines, Navy, Air Force and Army in the post-Cold War period</span>. In other words, //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">America's military became profoundly more involved in managing </span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">the world's security after the Soviet threat disappeared. </span>//Yet, the Human Security Report repeatedly alleges that the end of the Cold War unleashed the power of the United Nations! As the report notes, the U.N.'s peacekeeping efforts did increase by 700 percent from its tiny Cold War baseline, but that did not make the difference the authors repeatedly claim. To underscore the point, //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">just imagine a post-Cold War world where the U.S. -- and along with it NATO -- had disappeared from global security management just like post-Soviet Russia did</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">. What kind of security role would the U.N. have been in a position to play in such an environment?</span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">The H</span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">uman Security Report series put out by Simon Fraser University in Canada is the single best stream of analysis on global security trends out there</span>//. Its only shortcoming is the painfully transparent analytical acrobatics that it goes through to deny //<span style="font-size: 16px;">the U</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">nited States military</span>// its due credit in //<span style="font-size: 16px;">helping to create a global system that has rolled back war across the world.</span>//

<span style="color: #094b98;">B</span>y all accounts, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the success of the Pentagon’s ambitious plan to transform the U.S. military into a network-centric force is riding on the</span> transformational satellite communications system (<span style="font-size: 16px;">T-Sat</span>) now in development. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Defense planners are convinced that full-scale military transformation and network-centric operations will be impossible to achieve without the spaceborne communications that the revolutionary T-Sat constellation would provide.The military has begun its transition to highly mobile, fast-reaction, quick-strike, netcentric forces that include increasing numbers of autonomous or semiautonomous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).It</span> therefore <span style="font-size: 16px;">requires ultrareliable, superswift communications among all sorts of sensor systems, weapons platforms, and command posts in the air, on land, and at sea around the globe. T-Sats will be the space element</span>,<span style="font-size: 16px;">and the sine qua non, of the military’s planned GIG </span>(global information grid)—its “Internet in the sky.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Thus the T-Sat system is seen as “the cornerstone of [the Defense Dept.’s] future information operations</span>,” <span style="font-size: 16px;">the “centerpiece of our future global communications network,” and “the heart of the DOD net-centric operations environment concept essential to all future operations,”</span> a Pentagon document proclaims.





===Contention Two – China=== 

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Terrorists are preparing for cyber attack </span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Leghari ’11</span> [Faryal Leghari is Assistant Editor (Opinion) of Khaleej Times, “Hit C for cyberterrorism”, Jan 29, 2011, http://www.yobserver.com/opinions/10020698.html]

The defining word for the new age is ‘smart’. And it orbits the earth at a million bytes a minute. Whether it’s smart or not is merely a question of perspective. Smart for one may be intellectually deficient for another. What it does however is pitch a generation still in the middle stages of cyber evolution against one that is growing too fast too soon. Confusing? Not if you stand back from a vantage point and reflect on what is happening out there in cyber space. If you are not frozen in a perennial state of anxiety about being left behind, you are already sidelined. This may still be simplistic for those worrying about their social site updates and their be-on-the-top of the happening mode of the moment, but what about the immense challenge the whole technological gambit poses for the security arena? According to security analysts and intelligence specialists, __<span style="font-size: 16px;">cyberterrorism is a **big**</span>__ger **__<span style="font-size: 16px;">challenge</span>__** than supposed. __<span style="font-size: 16px;">The propensity of **Al Qaeda**</span>__and other terror groups __<span style="font-size: 16px;">to harness these means </span>__into a potentially lethal offensive capability__<span style="font-size: 16px;"> has **handed them a crucial advantage,** one they **have used with** </span>__//<span style="font-size: 16px;">considerable success</span>//__<span style="font-size: 16px;">.</span>__ Not only are terrorist groups culpable, but major world powers such as China and Russia too have been accused of launching cyber attacks against other states. Take for example the attacks on Estonia in 2007 or the one on Georgia in 2008 that brought the respective governments almost to a standstill. These were alleged to be perpetrated by Russia which later denied charges. Moreover, a cyber attack on the US federal agencies believed to be launched by North Korea in 2009 bring us to the strange new world of ‘virtual or cyber’ war. In today’s world, __<span style="font-size: 16px;">the heavy dependence on technology and computers, any attack — even</span>__ the one’s __<span style="font-size: 16px;">launched by non-state cyber criminals</span>__/hackers — **__<span style="font-size: 16px;">can spell disaster</span>__**, causing massive financial losses for organisations/corporate sector and civilians. One can only imagine the extent of damage an attack on state apparatus would inflict, let alone the security repercussions. For traditional terrorist groups using cyber space, there are numerous advantages. The proliferation of extremist websites standing in as recruitment boards and to spread propaganda makes cyber space a nurturing arena. Despite safeguards and the banning of several sites deemed threatening, the practice continues prolifically. __<span style="font-size: 16px;">The </span>__//<span style="font-size: 16px;">easy accessibility</span>//**__<span style="font-size: 16px;"> and </span>__**//<span style="font-size: 16px;">relatively cheap sources needed</span>//__<span style="font-size: 16px;"> to fund these activities **make it** </span>__//<span style="font-size: 16px;">especially attractive</span>//. With the growth of social networking sites, the most popular being Facebook and Twitter, the threat factor has actually rocketed. The Internet has put many disgruntled or easily influenced persons in direct or indirect contact with extremist elements. Take for example the Christmas Day Nigerian bomber Umer Farouk Abdulmuttalab who through initial cyber contact with the Yemeni cleric Anwar al Awlaki decided carry out a bombing onboard a Northwest plane to Detroit in 2009. The more discerning groups are continuously engaged in finding alternate routes to set platforms and coordinate attacks. The same portals are also used for standard communication. Often these groups engage hackers to facilitate their cyber operations, just like organised crime syndicates are used to coordinate and facilitate criminal/terror operations on ground. Drug trafficking, piracy, kidnappings, human trafficking are all areas that have seen a successful nexus being formed between terrorists and transnational organised crime syndicates. Moreover, hackers are used to provide intelligence information of government and security officials as vital support in planning physical targeted operations. Many security analysts and officials feel that cyberterrorism has not received due attention. Then there are also those who feel it is not a viable threat at present but may emerge in a more developed stage in future. However, it is still perceived that it may only be used in a subordinate support capacity. Interestingly, the opinion of top security officials differs. An international summit on cyber security by the East-West Institute in Dallas, Texas in 2010 brought together experts from a number of countries most of whom held cyberterrorism as a credible threat. They believed that the respective states including United States needed to revamp preventive measures against attacks in cyber space, implications of which were predicted to be monumental. According to a Guardian report dated May 5, 2010, Harry Raduege, former director at the Pentagon in charge of computer network warned that ‘cyber attacks were growing in intensity and sophistication.’ Similarly, the __<span style="font-size: 16px;">French director-</span>__general __<span style="font-size: 16px;">of information security</span>__ agency, Patrick __<span style="font-size: 16px;">Pailloux voiced his fears about attacks on ‘the electricity system, </span>__transport, water supplies, financial sector  and hospitals.’ This brings us to also look at areas beyond the traditional military arena. __<span style="font-size: 16px;">The critical areas of</span>____<span style="font-size: 16px;">power</span>__, water, health and financial institutions__<span style="font-size: 16px;"> **are** </span>__//<span style="font-size: 16px;">all vulnerable</span>//**__<span style="font-size: 16px;"> to cyber attacks</span>__**. Unfortunately, there is a lack of understanding of threat perception as well as basic attention and safeguard measures to secure these vital areas from such attacks. Regrettably, these are relegated inadvertently to a blur in the future. A report by the East West Institute notes the economic losses for China resulting from hacking and viruses amount to nearly a billion dollars annually. On the positive side is a growing realisation of the actual potential of cyberterrorism and its nexus with international organised crime. The Second Worldwide Cybersecurity Summit is being held in London in June this year to follow up on the Dallas summit and determine measures designed to safeguard cybersecurity. It is hoped that regular discussions between top security experts help arrive at a strategy that encompasses measures that will make the world a safer place to live in. As we step in the futuristic age, cyber attacks have begun to become a reality and not something one would enjoy as an integral part of the bigger picture. While a global cybersecurity treaty may still take years to come through, it is time to shape our defenses accordingly.

Because platforms such a Worldview-1 and GeoEye-1 are commer- cial in nature, and not subject to expensive add-ons and countermeasures which would enhance their survivability, these <span style="font-size: 16px;">commercial satellites are highly vulnerable to potential PRC interference and destruction</span>. Indeed, <span style="font-size: 16px;">such satellites would present the PRC with an attractive target set in any future cross-strait crisis because the disabling of commercial satellites would serve a valuable military purpose without greatly escalating a crisis</span>. Theoretically the adversary would be blinded (at least partially) and yet would have no legal grounds to declare war. The <span style="font-size: 16px;">PRC employed just such a strategy in the 1995-96 Cross-Strait Missile Crisis</span>, using radar-jamming to blind a commercial SAR imagery satellite that was providing Taiwan with intelligence on PLA exercises and the PLA military buildup opposite Taiwan.234 //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">Given</span>// this, //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">the U.S. </span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">government’s</span>// partial (and //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">growing) reliance upon commercial satellites for</span>//imagery and //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">communications certainly does represent an Achilles’ heellikely to be exploited by the PRC</span>//in any future conflict. How far such exploitation might go, and what affects it might have are subjects for the next chapter. In conclusion, this chapter has sought to describe the expanding U.S. reliance upon satellites, noting their economic value while primarily focusing on their military utility, to illustrate some of the ways space platforms are vital to the U.S. military’s revolution in military affairs. The Chinese ASAT test shows that the <span style="font-size: 16px;">U.S. military’s </span>unparalleled <span style="font-size: 16px;">space infrastructure</span>, while serving as an essential force-multiplier that gives the U.S. a tremendous edge in modern warfare, also <span style="font-size: 16px;">represents a weakness in the sense that it is particularly vulnerable to asymmetric interference and attack. This state of affairs is exacerbated as the U.S. military increasingly turns to commercial satellite providers</span> to offset budget overruns and scheduling delays in government-funded programs. Interestingly, the semi-classified military space budget did not drastically increase in the wake of the Chinese direct-assent ASAT test of last year despite the PRC action representing a significant, and troubling, alteration of both the PRC’s capabilities and intentions. We now turn to the next chapter to discuss the level of significance the Chinese development of counter-space weapons could have for U.S.-Sino relations in the coming years.

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Military cyber war causes nuclear war - </span>

The end of Cold War has led some to assume that <span style="font-size: 16px;">nuclear weapons</span>and nuclear deterrence <span style="font-size: 16px;">are passe.</span> Along with this, is a related <span style="font-size: 16px;">assumption that a revolution in high technology, conventional weaponry will accelerate the rate of nuclear political and military obsolescence. On the other hand, all concede that the "revolution in military affairs" is driven mostly by new technologies in information, communications, and electronics</span>. [1] New information and <span style="font-size: 16px;">communication technologies may enable new forms of war making, including information warfare, that are dysfunctional for deterrence stability with, or without, nuclear weapons.

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">AND – low scale hacking causes autnonomization </span>
Jutta <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Weber</span>, Guest Professor at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies at the University of Duisburg-Essen, 20<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">09 </span> [“Robotic Warfare, Human Rights & the Rhetorics of Ethical Machines”, peer reviewed by Jürgen Altmann, Cheris Kramarae, Angela Meyer, and Michael Nagenborg]
Before I will analyze more deeply the political and ethical problems of robotic warfare and the deployment of UCAVs, I would like to point to an additional problem of robotic warfare with UCAVs: The high risks of hacking their communication structures. Until now high- volume data transfers are vulnerable to wiretap and noise. <span style="font-size: 16px;">It is highly probable that hostile forces will engage in disabling the robot systems by hacking their communication infrastructure.</span> The latter is the weak point in UCAVs (see Altmann 2003, ISIS 2006, Sparrow 2007). <span style="font-size: 16px;">Hacked UCAVs would be highly dangerous not only to the soldiers of one’s own troops but also to anybody and especially civilians if UCAVs fall</span> – for example –<span style="font-size: 16px;">into the hands of</span> counter-<span style="font-size: 16px;">insurgents. As the military is also aware of this great danger, it is very likely that either a robot war between two high-tech nations will escalate into a space war to secure one’s satellites or autonomous weapon systems (AWS) will be deployed in the near future because they are less dependent on communication systems. The latter is highly problematic with regard to the question of international law and questions of responsibility, but also with regard to the heightening speed of warfare where wrong decisions can no more be cancelled or changed</span> (see i.e. Sparrow 2009a). Another problem is that UCAVs can be reconstructed quite easily. The availability, stability and low cost of hard and software components as well as the modularity of robot systems make it possible to build surveillance drones with only little know-how – and these drones can theoretically also be equipped with bombs (ISIS Europe 2006, Miasnikov 2007).

Where do you see <span style="font-size: 16px;">the main challenges for the international community regarding</span> the use of armed <span style="font-size: 16px;">unmanned systems</span> by the military. What are the specific challenges of autonomous systems as compared to current telerobotic systems? The main challenge <span style="font-size: 16px;">is</span> in <span style="font-size: 16px;">deciding whether the present trend should continue and expand</span>to many more countries and to many more types of armed uninhabited vehicles (in the air, on and under water, on the ground, also in outer space), <span style="font-size: 16px;">or whether efforts should be taken to constrain this arms race and limit the dangers connected to it</span>. Here not only governments, but non-governmental organisations and the general public should become active. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Autonomoussystems obviously would open many new possibilities for war by accident (possibly escalating up to nuclear war</span>) and for violations of the international laws of warfare. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A human decision</span>in each single weapon use <span style="font-size: 16px;">should be the minimum requirement</span>.

The weaknesses that he found in California exist in crucial facilities nationwide</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">,</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> U.S. officials and private experts say. The same industrial control systems Maiffret's team was able to commandeer also run electrical grids, pipelines, chemical plants and other infrastructure. </span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Those systems, many designed without security in mind, are vulnerable to cyber attacks that have the potential to blow up city blocks, erase bank data, crash planes and cut power to large sections of the country.</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda don't yet have the capability to mount such attacks</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, experts say, but potential adversaries such as China and Russia do, as do organized crime and hacker groups that could sell their services to rogue states or terrorists</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">. U.S. officials say China already has laced the U.S. power grid and other systems with hidden malware that could be activated to devastating effect</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. "</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">If a sector of the country's power grid were taken down, it's not only going to be damaging to our economy, but people are going to die,</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">" said Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), who has played a lead role on cyber security as a member of the House Intelligence Committee. Some experts suspect that the U.S. and its allies also have been busy developing offensive cyber capabilities. Last year, Stuxnet, a computer worm some believe was created by the U.S. or Israel, is thought to have damaged many of Iran's uranium centrifuges by causing them to spin at irregular speeds. In the face of the growing threats, the Obama administration's response has received mixed reviews. President Obama declared in a 2009 speech that </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">protecting computer network infrastructure "will be a national security priority." But the follow-through has been scant. Obama created the position of federal cyber-security "czar," and then took seven months to fill a job that lacks much real authority. Several cyber-security proposals are pending in Congress, but the administration hasn't said publicly what it supports</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. "I give the administration high marks for doing some things, but clearly not enough," Langevin said. The basic roadblocks are that the government lacks the authority to force industry to secure its networks and industry doesn't have the incentive to do so on its own. Meanwhile, </span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">evidence mounts on the damage a cyber attack could inflict. In a 2006 U.S. government experiment, hackers were able to remotely destroy a 27-ton, $1-million electric generator similar to the kind commonly used on the nation's power grid.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> A video shows it spinning out of control until it shuts down. [[image:http://wiki.debatecoaches.org/site/embedthumbnail/placeholder?w=200&h=50 width="200" height="50"]] In, 2008, U.S. </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">military officials discovered that classified networks at the U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, had been penetrated by a foreign intelligence service using malware spread through thumb drives</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. That attack led to the creation in 2009 of U.S. Cyber Command, a group of 1,000 spies and hackers charged with preventing such intrusions. They also are responsible for mounting offensive cyber operations, about which the government will say next to nothing. The head of Cyber Command, Gen. Keith Alexander, also leads the National Security Agency, the massive Ft. Meade, Md.-based spy agency in charge of listening to communications and penetrating foreign computer networks. Together, the NSA and </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Cyber Command have the world's most advanced capabilities, analysts say, and could wreak havoc on the networks of any country that attacked the U.S. — if they could be sure who was responsible</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. It's easy to hide the source of a cyber attack by sending the malware on circuitous routes through computers and servers in third countries. </span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">So deterrence of the sort relied upon to prevent nuclear war — the threat of massive retaliation — is not an effective strategy to prevent a cyber attack.</span><span style="font-size: 8px;"> Asked in a recent interview whether the U.S. could win a cyber war, Alexander responded, "</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">I believe that we would suffer tremendously if a cyber war were conducted today</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">, as would our adversaries." Alexander also is quick to point out that his cyber warriors and experts are legally authorized to protect only military networks. The Department of Homeland Security is charged with helping secure crucial civilian infrastructure, but in practice, the job mostly falls to the companies themselves</span>.//

Without electrical power, urban life would cease to exist, the information age would become a faded memory, and industrial production would grind to a halt.

//<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">ISR is the only effective deterrent to recent Chinese military build ups</span>//
//Alexander <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Neill</span>, head of the Asia Security Programme at the Royal United Services Institute, <span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">11</span> [“Viewpoint: A new Sino-US high-tech arms race?”, BBC News, Jan 11, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-asia-pacific-12154991]//
//Beneath the veneer of official smiles and neatly choreographed handshakes at the defence summit in Beijing, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the Sino-US relationship remains fraught with uncertainty</span>. A year after military relations were frozen by Beijing in the wake of a $6.4bn (£4.1bn) arms package to Taiwan, the US request for a resumption of a substantial strategic dialogue has been given a lukewarm reception in Beijing. The People's Liberation Army's (PLA) appetite for engagement with the US has waned considerably over the last year. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Cementing its defence arrangement with Taiwan, and holding large-scale naval war games in China's back yard in recent months, the US has buttressed its alliances with its East Asian allies. These actions have fuelled resentment in China and fears of US military encirclement. US irritation is based on a recent spate of harassment by the PLA Navy and Chinese fishing vessels against the US Navy and its allies in the West Pacific</span>. The US is also frustrated with China's intransigence towards meaningful strategic dialogue on international security concerns, particularly while tension on the Korean peninsula remains high and nuclear proliferation by North Korea continues unchecked. But the Pentagon's visceral concern is its failure to detect the break-neck speed of Chinese military technological advances and its ability to curb an arms race in East Asia. 'Pressure point warfare' Despite recent headlines reporting the appearance of a Chinese stealth fighter prototype, of more concern to US military planners is the enabling technology that will produce the bite to China's military bark. This angst is focused on China's decade-long programme of military "informationisation" designed to leap-frog over US capabilities in the Pacific region. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The PLA is rapidly developing asymmetric warfare techniques against US command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance infrastructure, known as "C4ISR" in military parlance. </span>For China, with its inferior conventional military capabilities, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the key to gaining the upper hand in a conflict with the US is to gain dominance of the space theatre and to damage its digital nerve system</span>. China views space as a corner-stone of its future prosperity: a mandate from heaven for China's growth and military strength. For this reason, China is working hard to counter the Pentagon's monopoly in space and to build its own space-based deterrent. The <span style="font-size: 16px;">PLA's</span> doctrine of "pressure point warfare", a multi-layered approach using space, cyberspace and information operations alongside conventional capabilities is designed to cripple an adversary in one swift strike. This fast paced and high-tech military modernisation has led to the emergence of weapons systems and technology, which in certain theatres has <span style="font-size: 16px;">closed the military capability gap with the US considerably. These include directed energy, jamming and cyber attack technologies, designed to paralyse the US military machine</span>. The PLA has recently developed and successfully tested advanced anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons systems, demonstrating it can destroy or manoeuvre close to enemy satellites in space. ASAT weapons are part of a new genre of "assassin's mace" or surprise weapons aimed at the Pentagon's Achilles Heel in space and cyberspace. All of these capabilities require state of the art signals processing and communications systems, technology which China has been developing indigenously to create its own command and control architecture. Carrier fears <span style="font-size: 16px;">One of the most pressing concerns for the United States navy is the prospect of US aircraft carriers and other vessels being denied access to theatres of operation in the event that the US were dragged into a conflict over Taiwan or in support of its other Pacific allies.</span> Coined by Pentagon planners as China's "A2/AD" (Anti Access/Area Denial) strategy, the PLA would attempt to prevent US aircraft carriers from deploying to theatre, targeted by Chinese torpedoes, Cruise Missiles and Anti Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBMs). <span style="font-size: 16px;">PLA tacticians know that a successful strike against a moving US aircraft carrier requires advanced space-based targeting assets and an ability to penetrate the US ballistic missile defence umbrella</span>.//

//Washington cocktail-party <span style="font-size: 16px;">conversations about China typically go something like this: A person from the China-as-a-peer-competitor school of thought says "I think China</span>, with its growing economy, growing military, and young, nationalistic population, <span style="font-size: 16px;">will only naturally lock horns with the U.S. in future decades." An advocate of the enmity-is-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy school responds "Maybe, but casting the Chinese in an adversarial role now will serve to drive them away from the U.S. </span>and from a friendship that I think they're open to." As the impasse is marked with polite sipping of the Cabernet Sauvignon, each guest searches for rescue by a more like-minded conversationalist. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Turning the tables on such an exchange is the new report</span> of// <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">Congress's U.S.-China Security Review Commission</span>//<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">.</span> Never mind what you chatterers think, the bipartisan report seems to interject, because <span style="font-size: 16px;">the die is cast: "China's leaders consistently characterize the United States as a 'hegemon,</span>' connoting a powerful protagonist and overbearing <span style="font-size: 16px;">bully that is China's major competitor, but they also believe that the United States is a declining power with important military vulnerabilities that can be exploited. China views itself as an emerging power." </span>Specifically, China's military leaders are focusing on several investments and advances cannot be mistaken for anything but preparations for conflict against the U.S.// <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">This focus is far from meaning that conflict is inevitable</span>//<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">.</span> It doesn't even rule out cooperation and close U.S.-China ties in a variety of areas. But it <span style="font-size: 16px;">should stop in its tracks any wishful thinking that China doesn't already see the U.S. as a potential military adversary</span>. It should also make apparent that <span style="font-size: 16px;">China's leaders</span>, for their part, <span style="font-size: 16px;">aren't worried that their planning will alienate the United States. Among China'</span>s U.S.-oriented military ambitions, it <span style="font-size: 16px;">seeks to advance its: Ability to sink a U.S. carrier</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">: </span>China has publicly stated that it intends to be able to sink an American aircraft carrier. Among the technologies that could allow China to do this are anti-ship cruise missiles, which China could fire from land across long distances, and which it is now developing. China is also developing an over-the-horizon radar network with which to track surface ships. China has reportedly bought from Russia eight new Kilo-class diesel subs. China, which already has four of the subs is to take delivery of the eight beginning in 2007. China's growing fleet of diesel subs is supplemented by a program to develop nuclear subs, the congressional report says. The nuclear sub development, called "Project 093," is to begin between 2003-05 and already has Russian cooperation. Whether this program will be successful is far from clear, however. In addition, China is acquiring the high-speed Russian anti-ship SS-22 Sunburn missile, and advanced wake-homing torpedoes. Some of these advances could be used in anti-submarine warfare against the U.S. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Focus on asymmetrical warfare</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">:</span>China's President Jiang Zemin in 1999 called for the People's Liberation Army to develop weapons with which a technologically inferior Chinese military might defeat a technologically superior U.S. one. More specifically, China seeks to develop "assassin's mace" weapons -- what Americans might call a "magic bullet" -- with which to attack U.S. vulnerabilities. This focus on "asymmetrical warfare" draws on two millennia of Chinese strategic tradition. The congressional report says China focuses on such weaknesses as U.S. reliance on computer networks, dependency on satellites for military reconnaissance, navigation, and communications. The Chinese also plan to target business communications, and specific systems such as the New York Stock Exchange computers or the communications and computers of airbases and carriers. Another example of an asymmetrical capability, though not one discussed in the report, is China's existing ability to launch a massive missile barrage against Taiwan or a traditional U.S. basing site such as Okinawa, Japan. The threat of such a barrage could pressure Japan to deny the U.S. access to Okinawa, thereby exploiting U.S. over-dependency on foreign bases in the event of a Taiwan conflict. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Focus on space</span><span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">: China has seven military satellites and is building more. It has a modest, two-satellite version of the U.S. Global Positioning System of satellites, and has plans to expand it. Other research on China published by the Pentagon has pointed out that the PLA is developing ground-based anti-satellite technology.</span> While these advances don't spell out a future in which China will be a U.S. "peer," China is definitely a "competitor." It would be convenient and reassuring to dismiss China's military advances and the recently announced expansion of its military spending by 17.6% as measures directed at the perennial tensions with Taiwan. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">the advances outlined here are focused on countering U.S. capabilities, not Taiwanese ones</span>. To be sure, <span style="font-size: 16px;">Chinese military planners may be calculating that the U.S. would get involved in a cross-strait military conflict. But there's more to China's range of investments than planning for a brush with the U.S. in the Taiwan Strait. </span>Rather, <span style="font-size: 16px;">China's military planners seem to think the possibility of a large-scale, future military conflict between them and the dominant Pacific power is real, and should be prepared for. That's not necessarily a bellicose conclusion, it's just realist. And since it's Beijing's conclusion</span>, __<span style="font-size: 16px;">there's no reason Washington should draw a different one</span>____<span style="font-size: 16px;">. </span>__//

//<span style="color: #0d0d0d;">Finally, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">the growing Chinese capability for space warfare implies that a future conflict in the Taiwan Strait would entail serious deterrence and crisis instabilities. </span>If such a clash were to compel Beijing to attack US space systems at the beginning of a war,<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;"> the very prospect of such a ‘space Pearl Harbor’ could, in turn, provoke the United States to contemplate pre-emptive attacks</span> or horizontal escalation on the Chinese mainland.

//The committee report also addressed use of <span style="font-size: 16px;">commercial imagery and statutes</span> and regulations governing space commerce. Members of the committee’s Minority criticized several aspects of the report and maintained that it <span style="font-size: 16px;">failed to “address the importance of integrated ground systems for tasking, processing, exploitation and dissemination</span>.”47 In November 2008 a Joint Defense Science Board and Intelligence Science Board task force on integrating sensor-collected intelligence produced a report looking at various flaws in current ISR efforts that extend beyond acquisition issues. It argued that <span style="font-size: 16px;">ISR efforts can be better improved by integrating data from multiple sensors rather than by improving the design and performance of single sensors</span>. In making this argument the task force pointed to structural issues that complicate such data integration. To accomplish this goal the task force recommended ensuring the inclusion of meta-data (or tags that describe specific data that can in turn be searchable whereas the data itself may not be) that can allow identification of information of specific interest. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The task force’s emphasis on better ways to access and analyze data is influenced by the vast expansion in data available and in many cases never exploited</span>. It tended to favor a larger number of less sophisticated systems and achieve increased performance by integrating data from multiple sensors and platforms.48 <span style="font-size: 16px;">Significant problems derive from limitations on the dissemination of collected data. Currently, meta-data are not consistently applied and tags are not consistent from agency to agency</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Military commanders demand much larger quantities and more sophisticated types of intelligence</span>(especially tactical imagery), <span style="font-size: 16px;">but in many cases are unaware of and incapable of accessing data</span>available throughout the intelligence community. “<span style="font-size: 16px;">The number of images and signal intercepts are well beyond the capacity of the existing analyst community so there are huge backlogs for translators and image interpreters and much of the collected data are never reviewed</span>. Further, decision makers and intelligence analyst have difficulty knowing what information is available.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Although an enormous number of full-motion video missions in support of tactical commanders has been conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan</span>, the task force suggested that <span style="font-size: 16px;">surveillance has often been episodic and continuing coverage of a given region had not alwaysbeen possible</span>.The task force report emphasized that the// <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">ISR concept encompasses more than platforms for collection</span>//. It noted that DOD has developed the Global Information Grid which includes a high-speed communications network of various ground, air and space components. <span style="font-size: 16px;">There is a need, according to the task force, for better ways for tactical commanders to access this information “on the move</span>” and thus it emphasized the advantages of assured and// <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">accessible communications as would be made available by the redundant and complementary communications capabilities terrestrial fiber, government and civilian communications satellites, networks built and maintained by specific agencies. (The task force advocated the Transformational Satellite System</span>//(//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">TSAT) to provide links to the fiber network to mobile and fixed theater command</span>//s. TSAT was subsequently killed by DOD because it was considered duplicative.) A key goal should be, according to the Task Force, to ensure that <span style="font-size: 16px;">future communications systems adhere to interoperability standards to ensure that they can support joint and international operations</span> as wel las “reach back” to U.S. agencies for analytical support. The <span style="font-size: 16px;">essential concern of the task force was to ensure that the ongoing proliferation of platforms and sensors be matched by sufficient communications capabilities to enable their use.</span> Currently, they found that “Our// <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">rapidly growing airborne ISR collection capabilities are not in balance with supporting communications.</span>

//In many ways <span style="font-size: 16px;">China’s counter-space platforms</span>, such as its already operational directed-energy, ground-based lasers and its direct-ascent, solid-fueled (and therefore rapidly deployable) ASAT missiles that can be launched from any of China’s hundreds of road-mobile, SRBM and MRMB launchers, already <span style="font-size: 16px;">represent a real threat to U.S. forces</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This threat will only grow and ramify with time, perhaps geometrically so, as the PRC continues to grow its young stock of operational</span> Dong Feng-31 (DF-31) road-mobile <span style="font-size: 16px;">ICBMs</span>, which while generally thought to be tipped with 400 kiloton nuclear <span style="font-size: 16px;">warheads</span>,235 <span style="font-size: 16px;">could be modified to attack U.S. national security satellites in GEO</span> with KKVs or future co-orbital killer satellites, EMP weapons and high-powered microwave weapons, all of which are under development. In the interim, General Cartwright’s statement, mentioned previously, that the PRC would be able to destroy all the U.S. reconnaissance satellites in LEO by 2010 appears to be correct.236 According to Desmond Ball, it would require approximately 20 ASAT missiles of the type that destroyed FY-1C last year to destroy 6-7 LEO satellites, which is the number of current U.S. Crystal and Lacrosse space vehicles currently believed to be in orbit. Assuming they passed over or near the PRC, U.S. spy satellites would indeed be vulnerable to China’s ASAT weapons by 2010, as 20 operational, direct-ascent ASAT missiles would presumably be easy enough to field by that time given that the PRC is already mass-producing well over a hundred similar missile platforms a year. All one would need to modify would be the warhead and guidance package, both of which have been already been proven and have been operational as of January 11, 2007.237 The PLA can be expected to continue to develop its ASAT guidance package (which is reportedly radar based and therefore highly vulnerable to jamming) in order to overcome U.S. defense satellites’ built-in counter-measures, which are thought to be quite technologically impressive.238 Therefore the PRC already has an operational ASAT capability, and one that is likely to grow in sophistication and capability. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This will add to the U.S. imperative to counter and deter the Chinese counter-space weapons, and further fuel the U.S.-Sino cold war style build-up in space mentioned previously.In the near-term China is unlikely to be able to compete directly with the U.S., and therefore will continue its asymmetric efforts to exploit the U.S. vulnerability in space.</span> Looking more distantly, <span style="font-size: 16px;">however, one can forecast a situation where China is competing with the U.S. in space</span>(and <span style="font-size: 16px;">on terra firma</span>) as more of a peer-competitor. In such a situation, <span style="font-size: 16px;">whereby there is a relative balance of power and mutual reliance upon orbital space, one could foresee increased stability and something akin to the détente that characterized the later stages of the cold war and led to U.S.-Soviet cooperation in outer space</span>. However, as noted by a recent study, it will be a long time before the PRC can be considered a true peer competitor of the U.S. in space.239// <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">In the interim, there is a strong possibility that the relationship between the two powers will be unstable, withpotential global repercussions</span>//. China’s irresponsible actions in space only underscore that growing trend, and point to a disturbing strategic environment in the years ahead. That said, the likely U.S. response to any ASAT attack on an American government satellite, which would be viewed much in the same way that an attack on U.S. terrestrial forces would be (i.e. an act of war), probably rule it out barring a massive miscalculation on the part of the Chinese leadership or a Chinese decision to engage in a Pearl Harbor style sneak attack. The danger lies in the fact that as the PRC’s counter-space capabilities grow and become more subtle with the development of micro-satellites, nano-satellites and other less conspicuous ASAT platforms which could potentially interfere with U.S. satellites without going so far as destroying them, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the U.S.-Sino relationship in space may become more unstable because the potential Chinese menu of options would be increasingly tempting</span>, offering as it would ever more possibilities at a time when the U.S. reliance upon satellites was ever greater. To <span style="font-size: 16px;">offset this scenario</span>, which would mix a dangerous brew of Chinese capabilities with U.S. vulnerabilities in a situation <span style="font-size: 16px;">thatcould escalate rapidly to general war, the U.S. can be expected to not only diversify and strengthen its orbital assets, but also to develop better air-breathing reconnaissance platforms</span>, such as smaller, stealthier Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV) with longer dwell times in order to have the ability to rapidly restore lost satellite coverage in a crisis. <span style="font-size: 16px;">This U.S. diversification and multiplication of reconnaissance assets would thereby both strengthen the durability of its C4ISR network and force the PRC to plan for more targets, thus making it a less tempting option and creating an environment for better deterrence</span>. Let us now conclude this chapter with a summation and a brief policy suggestion.//

//<span style="font-size: 16px;">If war resulted, escalation pressures would be enormous</span>. It would be the first significant war between nuclear weapons states in world history. And the nuclear arsenals of the two sides could, as unreasonable and illogical as it sounds, come into play.// <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">Nuclear exchanges could even result</span>//. At a time when <span style="font-size: 16px;">the threat of superpower nuclear war has become much less vivid in the public eye</span> due to the end of the Cold War, <span style="font-size: 16px;">a Taiwan crisis could—ironically enough—quickly create </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">the most serious nuclear risk </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">since the Cuban Missile Crisis</span>. The conclusion is not intended to be melodramatic. Even in the event of war, the risk of nuclear conflagration would be be much less than fifty-fifty, since both sides would surely recognize the dangers. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">crises have dynamics all their own</span>. What neither side would see as desirable could nonetheless occur as the fog of war impeded accurate and timely <span style="font-size: 16px;">information flows and clouded leaders’ judgments—and</span> as <span style="font-size: 16px;">the loss of lives raised the stakes to the point whereneither Beijing nor Washington could easily back down</span>. In addition, the war plans of the two sides could create momentum of their own. Although details are classified (and always changing in any even), <span style="font-size: 16px;">in the past these war plans apparently have called for hastier escalation than political leaders generally appreciate</span>. This may have changed of late, and certainly recent American commanders in the region have been sensitive to the need to build positive relationships with China and to avoid assuming that conflict would quickly escalate. But <span style="font-size: 16px;">predisposition to restraint may not easily survive direct combat with a major military power; arguments in favor of rapid escalation will be powerful</span>, whether or not the carry the day. Leaders in Taiwan, China, and the United States need to think these issues through thoroughly in advance—for the sake of their war plans, their diplomacy, and their politics. They must figure out how to avoid escalation in any serious crisis or war that beings—for once the three parties get to that point, <span style="font-size: 16px;">avoiding all-out U.S.-China war is more important than other realistic concerns</span>. Indeed, it is so paramount in importance that Taipei, Beijing, and Washington must avoid the temptation to manufacture crises or play politics with the independence of sovereignty issues.

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Some officials have expressed concern that difficulties in mastering the technological intricacies of the signal processor/router may prevent its full development in time for the first scheduled T-Sat</span>launch. But Meink appears optimistic. “<span style="font-size: 16px;">From a technology standpoint, I think we’re in pretty good shape</span>,” says the program manager. He notes that the <span style="font-size: 16px;">contractors have considerable experience with similar technology in so-called heritage satellites</span>. “I’m not saying that any of this is easy to do,” Meink asserts. “We still have a lot of work to do, but <span style="font-size: 16px;">we’re meeting our objectives</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">We’re either on or ahead of schedule on the technologies. We’ve had a number of demonstrations in the lasercom and processor/router areas</span>. The contractors are meeting what they set out to do.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">Risk reduction has very high priority in the T-Sat design/development phase. Meink says the T-Sat program was carefully configured from the beginning to avoid the problems of hasty and haphazard structuring</span> that have plagued some other space programs in recent years. “<span style="font-size: 16px;">We’ve taken more time than normal in the early part of the program to make sure that we’ve gotten this right, to ensure that the technology has matured to a higher level than usual in going into development</span>,” he says. He also notes that <span style="font-size: 16px;">the program will involve the independent, noncontractor testing of all advanced technology elements.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">It started on January 12th, when the Obama administration negged an international agreement aimed at both reducing dangerous space debris and keeping space as demilitarized as possible</span>. As Canada’s National Post noted//<span style="font-size: 16px;">, the White House rejected the covenant specifically “because it impinged on the (U.S.) military’s use of space.”</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">A few days after the rejection,</span> Secretary of State Hillary <span style="font-size: 16px;">Clinton issued a formal statement declaring</span> that //<span style="font-size: 16px;">the U</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">nited States “will not enter into a code of conduct that in any way constrains our national security-related activities in space</span>//.” <span style="font-size: 16px;">With neoconservatives promoting superheated claims that space demilitarization will harm America’s national security,the administration’s declaration looks politically timed, especially considering</span> that, according to the New York Times //<span style="font-size: 16px;">in 2010, the White House previously promised to “renounce the unilateral stance </span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">of the Bush administration and instead emphasize international cooperation (in space), including the possibility of an arms control treaty that would limit the development of space weapons.” </span>//In one sense, this is nothing new. After all//<span style="font-size: 16px;">, the United States government has long been trying to militarize space.</span>// As far back as 1958, for example, Time magazine reported that Lt.

In practice, that means a stealth effort to dominate the Arctic, a brazen attempt to control the Internet, and yes, //<span style="font-size: 16px;">the ongoing attempt to dominate space for military purposes.</span>//

<span style="font-size: 16px;">With TSAT, everything changes. While WGS and AEHF are evolutionary gains in capability and capacity, TSAT is truly transformation. Certainly, TSAT is more of the same in some respects; </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">TSAT will offer a tenfold increase in capacity over AEHF</span>//.<span style="font-size: 16px;">However, when you consider IP routing in space, the incredible gains as the result of laser communications, the efficiency delivered through dynamic bandwidth allocation (you get the bandwidth you need, when you need it) and T1 (1.544 Mbs) date rates for protected comm-on-the-move users with small diameter antennas, </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">TSAT will change the way we fight, coordinate, collaborate, maneuve</span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">r</span>//—I could go on and on. <span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT will move more data, more protected data, to more users, while on the move.

As planned, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the T-Sat operational constellation will consist of five highly advanced communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit. A sixth T-Sat will be deployed as an inactive spare in the event of attrition</span>. Each <span style="font-size: 16px;">T-Sat will provide</span> both laser communications (<span style="font-size: 16px;">lasercom) and</span> advanced <span style="font-size: 16px;">radio frequency</span>(RF) communications, <span style="font-size: 16px;">with crosslinks to other space platforms and downlinks to airborne, land-based, and sea-based platforms.</span> Each <span style="font-size: 16px;">T-Sat will also embody the so-called next-generation signal processor/router (NGPR) for ultra-high-speed prioritization</span> and distribution of communications. These innovative features will enable the TSat system to disseminate a wealth of information through and from space in rapid-fire fashion, at exceedingly high data rates, to military and national intelligence users, in fixed positions or on the move, anywhere in the world. T<span style="font-size: 16px;">Sats are designed to withstand jamming and other disruptive or destructive antisatellite countermeasures</span>. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are competing for the contract to produce the T-Sats in an acquisition program that will cost an estimated $16 billion. In January 2004, the Air Force awarded each company a contract of about $500 million to carry out the design and risk-reduction phase of T-Sat development. The service will select the winner in late FY06. First launch of a <span style="font-size: 16px;">T-Sat is planned for</span>the <span style="font-size: 16px;">2013</span>-2015 time frame.

The <span style="font-size: 16px;">T-Sat system is the heart of the Pentagon’s transformational communications architecture</span><span style="font-size: 12.6667px;">(TCA), </span>devised by defense scientists in 2004 under the direction of Peter Teets, former undersecretary of the Air Force. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The TCA resulted from the transformational communications study (TCS) undertaken by the Defense Dept</span>. in 2002. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The architecture addresses, among other things, wideband space-to-space and space-tohigh-altitude airborne communications using a common standard for laser communication; communications and relay satellites; ground terminals; operational management systems; and communications interfaces. </span>The <span style="font-size: 12.6667px;">TCA </span>makes sure that new, transformational satcom systems will be able to connect with existing, or legacy, systems in space. The Air Force-managed T-Sat/<span style="font-size: 12.6667px;">T-MOS </span>system is being developed to do just that. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Meink explains that T-Sat will be “the means of removing communications constraints in terms of capacity, control, adaptability, responsiveness, and coverage</span>,” <span style="font-size: 16px;">and of meeting global U.S. requirements for communications across the defense, intelligence, and civil communities</span>, including <span style="font-size: 12.6667px;">NASA</span>. “<span style="font-size: 16px;">T-Sat would be a key enabler of our forces whether or not they go to this idealized net-centric warfare,”</span> Meink says. “T-Sat would be critical to what our forces are capable of doing right now, not just to what they’ll be capable of doing in the future. <span style="font-size: 16px;">We’re trying to do as much as we can with what we have right now.” The key to T-Sat’s transformational capability lies in its packet-routed, rather than circuit-switched, communications, </span>the program director notes. He explains that <span style="font-size: 16px;">packet-routing will result in “dynamic, seamless, full-mesh connectivity—connecting anyone to everyone” using the GIG</span>, whereas circuit-switching is relatively static, and affords only point-to-point or multipoint connectivity

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Commercial aerospace fails – oversight is key – Aerospace effective</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">One reason A&D companies are sometimes charged with being costly, cumbersome, risk averse and bureaucratic is that they mirror their primary customers</span>. And, inevitably, the <span style="font-size: 16px;">periodic attempts to make the process more economical and “commercial-like” fail because this government marketplace is the antithesis of a commercial one</span>. Commercial businesses work in generally open markets, dealing directly with multiple customers empowered to make buying decisions through individual transactions, and with growth largely constrained by anti-trust laws. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A&D companies are largely dealing with a single customer set comprised of multiple, competing political constituencies, with growth and size limits often set by industrial base considerations.</span> Commercial firms work to a price-based, closed book business model. The market determines what consumers will pay for a particular widget, irrespective of what it costs to make it. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A&D companies work to a cost-based, open book business model</span>. Cost and price negotiations are governed by the Truth in Negotiation Act (TINA) and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) that lay out every element of contractor cost to be analyzed. To ensure A&D companies are fulfilling their DOD contractual obligations, in 2009 the Defense Contracting Auditing Agency (DCAA) employed 4,000 people with a budget of $433M, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) had 10,000 civilians with a budget of over $1B, and the Office of the Inspector General had 1,475 auditors and a budget of $288M. In addition, there are military service acquisition and program management offices for every program, the Office of the Secretary of Defense acquisition community and Congress’ auditing arm, the General Accountability Office (GAO). The Department of Defense has stated that it will further increase oversight by hiring 20,000 more acquisition professionals, at a time of flattening acquisition budgets. <span style="font-size: 16px;">A&D companies have to staff their program management, finance, contracts and internal audit functions to service these legally mandated government requirements. Unless a commercial company really messes up</span> (Enron, AIG, BP, Lehman Brothers), <span style="font-size: 16px;">it is likely to face limited government oversight. By the very nature of its work, an A&D company lives with significant oversight every day.</span> A commercial company faces very limited controls over most exports; defense exports, quite rightly, <span style="font-size: 16px;">are by far the most highly regulated of any industrial sector</span>. Each step along the way to a foreign sale of U.S. defense equipment requires its own State Department export license, and each proposed sale over $50M is subject to Congressional review. As of 2010, there are literally tens of thousands of active licenses that govern how A&D companies approach the international marketplace. And finally, a commercial company’s product life cycles are largely driven by consumer demand. Some products go gang-busters for years while others simply go bust. <span style="font-size: 16px;">For A&D companies, program life cycles are driven by the vagaries of annual budgeting and appropriations processes, changing threats, requirements, and philosophies, program performance and, in some cases, political whims. The business consequences can occasionally be surreal, and the military impacts consequential. </span>

Other parts of the technology aggregate information for transmission through larger network trunks for global distribution via fiber optic cables, microwave towers, or both lowaltitude and high-altitude satellites. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The designs for this technology must enable rapid communications between individuals in all services, and rapid sharing of data and information between mobile platforms and sensors used by all military services</span>.60 The <span style="font-size: 16px;">architectures must also have the ability to dynamically self-heal and re-form the network when one or more communications nodes are interrupted. DOD officials have noted that the new military Global Information Grid (GIG) must be also designed to interoperate securely with the networks of other organizations outside of DOD</span>, including state and local governments, multinational military commands, and the commercial and research communities.61<span style="font-size: 16px;">Some observers question whether the U.S. military can achieve true network and systems interoperability among all services. DOD reportedly intends to integrate the architectures of network systems used by all branches of the military to create a network centric capability linked to the GIG</span>(seesectionbelow). Tohelpaccomplish this integration, the <span style="font-size: 16px;">DOD Joint Staff has created a new Force Capability Board (FCB) to monitor NCO programs for mismatches in funding, or mismatches in capability</span>. When an issue is detected, the FCB reports to the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, which then provides guidance during budget deliberations at the Pentagon.62

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">TSAT is specifically key to Solve bandwidth Shortages– Current Satellite communications don’t meet ISR needs </span>
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">JDSB 8</span> [Report of the Joint Defense Science Board Intelligence Science Board Task Force on Integrating Sensor-Collected Intelligence, November, http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/dsb/sensors.pdf]
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Just as the military and intelligence communities have transformed the way they operate, TSAT will transform the way they communicate</span>. As shown in figure E-12, <span style="font-size: 16px;">TSAT will provide a dramatic increase in capacity and capability over </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">existing</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;"> and interim </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">satellite</span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">communications</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;"> resources</span>. Depending on circumstances, <span style="font-size: 16px;">military forces often operate from unimproved and disadvantaged locations world-wide, are highly mobile, and depend heavily on reach-back for near-real time intelligence, imagery, and logistical information as well as inter-unit cooperation and support. </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">The greatly expanded use of UAVs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and for direct target engagement has placed extraordinary demands on the current SATCOM system. TSAT will mitigate those demands and further operational flexibility</span>//.The TSAT system is essential to enhancing military and intelligence operations. //<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">Without TSAT</span>////<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;">, mobile land forces and Navy ships will lack sufficient assured ISR communications</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;"> capacity, and the Military and IC will be unable to move and fully benefit from the large and growing quantity of data generated by new airborne and space ISR systems</span>. TSAT exemplifies the promise of the TCA’s enhanced capabilities and is a critical element of the transformation in military and intelligence operations.

In that post I was thinking [...]<span style="font-size: 16px;"> of Theoretical non-sense – a more scrupulously conscientious theoretical and critical rhetoric.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">China will say yes but - now is crucial – China is concerned about future efforts by the US to militarize space – the combination of the counterplan’s CONDITION is key to solving - the plan alone triggers a global space arms race that causes extinction and turns the case. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">NEWTOWN, Pa., March 15th, 2011 -- </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">The Lockheed Martin-led team developing the U.S. Air Force’s next generation Global Position System, known as GPS III, has successfully completed the program’s first major flight software integration milestone</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">at the company’s software integration laboratory in Newtown, Pa. The test event successfully integrated the initial flight software builds and flight-like computer processors for the satellite bus On-Board Computer (OBC), the Navigation Payload Mission Data Unit (MDU) and the Communications Payload Thin Communications Unit (TCU). The successful test demonstrated the ability to communicate between the GPS III satellite bus, network communications and navigation elements, and is a key step in reducing risk for the program’s flight software development. “</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">The entire government/industry team is focused on delivering GPS III affordably and efficiently to meet the ever-expanding needs of the nearly one billion GPS users worldwide,”</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> said Keoki Jackson, Lockheed Martin’s GPS III program manager. “Completion of this flight software milestone demonstrates our continued positive momentum and is another step forward in reducing risk and increasing mission assurance for this vital program.” The GPS III team will now work to fully qualify the flight software prior to integration on the GPS Non-Flight Satellite Testbed (GNST), which will serve as the program’s ground pathfinder and vehicle demonstrator for the first complete GPS III satellite. The entire GPS III development and production sequence will utilize the GNST to provide space vehicle design level validation; early verification of ground, support, and test equipment; and early confirmation and rehearsal of transportation operations. The GPS III team successfully completed the program’s Critical Design Review (CDR) in August 2010, and is proceeding steadily in the manufacturing phase. Having completed more than 50 percent of the program’s Manufacturing Readiness Reviews (MRRs) and now </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">with completion of the first major flight software milestone, the team is on track to deliver the first GPS IIIA spacecraft as planned in 2014</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">GPS III will improve position, navigation and timing services</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and provide advanced anti-jam capabilities yielding superior system security, accuracy and reliability. The first increment, in a planned three increments, GPS IIIA will </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">deliver signals three times more accurate than current GPS spacecraft and provide three times more power for military users</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, while also enhancing the spacecraft’s design life and adding a new civil signal designed to be interoperable with international global navigation satellite systems. </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">The GPS constellation provides critical situational awareness and precision weapon guidance for the military and supports a wide range of civil, scientific and commercial functions</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> - from air traffic control to navigation systems in cars, cell phones and wristwatches. GPS is increasing productivity in areas as diverse as farming, mining, construction, surveying, package delivery and supply chain management. The system is also enhancing public safety by reducing response times for ambulances, firefighters and other emergency services.</span>

Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based radio positioning, navigation, and time (PNT) distribution system. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The GPS Block III Space and Control Segments include</span>, but are not limited to, <span style="font-size: 16px;">advanced concept development, systems engineering and analysis, satellite systems development, the study of augmentation systems, control segment development, user equipment interfaces, training simulators, Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) products, and developmental test resources</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">GPS III</span>, will <span style="font-size: 16px;">givenew</span>navigation <span style="font-size: 16px;">warfare</span>(NAVWAR) <span style="font-size: 16px;">capabilities to shut off GPS service to a limited geographical location while providing GPS to US and allied forces</span>. GPS III <span style="font-size: 16px;">will</span> offer significant improvements in navigation capabilities by <span style="font-size: 16px;">improving interoperability and jam resistance.</span> The procurement of the GPS III system is planned for multiple blocks, with the GPS IIIA portion currently underway. GPS IIIA includes all of the GPS IIF capability plus up to a ten-fold increase in signal power, a new civil signal compatible with the European Union&rsquo;s Galileo system, and a new spacecraft bus that will allow a growth path to future blocks. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The global, around-the-clock availability of navigation and precise time transfer provided by GPS of course rests largely on the mission capability of the NAVSTAR satellites</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">As the legacy of GPS ages, so do many of these satellites.</span> As of 2002 the constellation of 27 operational GPS satellites consisted of three different generations, or block types. Specifically, the constellation included 3 Block II, 18 Block IIA, and 6 Block IIR vehicles. <span style="font-size: 16px;">Of the 21</span> older II/IIA <span style="font-size: 16px;">satellites</span>, <span style="font-size: 16px;">20 were past their contracted mean mission duration of 6 years, and 17 are past their design life of 7.5 years</span>. Moreover, of all the satellites, <span style="font-size: 16px;">13 were one component away from mission failure</span>, and nine are one component away from bus failure. As the community charts the future of the satellite constellation, in terms of modernization and GPS III, <span style="font-size: 16px;">the overall age of the constellation unavoidably forces program managers into tough decisions</span> related to balancing the longterm goals of system enhancement with the short-term needs of mission sustenance. Current plans call for modifying the last 12 of the third-generation GPS satellites, Block IIR, by adding more power, a second civil signal and a new, more robust military signal. The fourth-generation satellite, Block IIF, was under development. This spacecraft will have many improvements over its predecessors to include longer life, improved reliability, more power, and a third civil signal capable of satisfying safety-of-life requirements for civil aviation. The first GPS IIF launch was scheduled for 2008. These new satellites will broadcast two new civil signals: one of which was introduced in 2003, the other in 2007. The added signals will increase the robustness of the civil service and improve accuracy to 3-5 meters. The generation after next will be composed of <span style="font-size: 16px;">GPS III satellites</span>, <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">which</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">will include all of the legacy capabilities, plus the addition of high-powered, anti-jam military-code, along with other accuracy, reliability, and data integrity improvements. </span>Plans are being formulated to conduct an architecture study for the next-generation satellite navigation system, GPS III,<span style="font-size: 16px;">capable of meeting military and civil needs through 2030</span>. This jam resistant, modernized version of the world&rsquo;sgreatest free utility will be developed and delivered to <span style="font-size: 16px;">ensure the US has the most precise and secure positioning, navigation and timing capability</span>. The GPS III program objective is to develop and deploy an improved systems architecture for the NAVSTAR GlobalPositioning System (GPS) to <span style="font-size: 16px;">assure reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position, velocity, and timing</span> (PVT) <span style="font-size: 16px;">signals for the evolving needs of GPS civil and military users</span>. <span style="font-size: 16px;">GPS III eliminates numerous existing shortcomings and vulnerabilities inherent in the current GPS architecture that threaten to severely impact vital civil commerce, transportation, public safety, as well as military operations in the future. </span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The USAF has had issues with over-budget satellite programs in the past, in part because the technology requirements were often leaping ahead on too many fronts at once. This is a natural response to systems with a satellite’s large launch costs and long life cycle, but the lagging launch schedules and liberal cost overruns were becoming limiting.</span> GPS III incorporates these lessons, and will be set up as an incremental acquisition, with a ground segment and 3 blocks of investment and inserts: GPS Block III satellites are larger than previous Navstar buses, which allows more power, which in turn creates a signal that’s easier to acquire and harder to jam. The initial GPS IIIA satellites will feature agreed-upon compatibility with Europe’s rival Galileo system, add a 4th civil signal (L1C), and add a stronger military GPS (m-code) signal that’s expected to deliver fourfold accuracy improvements and an order of magnitude improvement in anti-jam capability. These simple requirements ensure that older GPS-IIA satellites can quickly be replaced by the newest proven designs. The USAF would like to cap GPS IIIA satellites at 8 (2 R&D + 6 operational, all 8 will be launched), but the initial contract has provisions for up to 12 GPS-IIIA satellites if necessary. GPS Block IIIB satellites will add a cross-linked command and control architecture. In English, this means that the entire constellation of GPS IIIB+ satellites will be updated at once from a single ground station, instead of having to wait for each satellite to orbit in view of a ground antenna as is currently the case. Up to 8 GPS-IIIB satellites are slated for launch. GPS Block IIIC satellites will add a high-powered spot beam to deliver greater M-Code power, better resistance to hostile jamming, and improved accuracy. Other technologies that become mature during the development period could also be added. The USAF intends to launch up to 16 GPS-IIIC satellites. The first launch of a GPS-IIIA satellite is expected in 2014, with all //<span style="font-size: 16px;">32 GPS Block III satellites expected to be on orbit by 2022</span>//. The current GPS III system design and development contract award will create about 500 new jobs for Lockheed Martin, and about 750 layoffs at Boeing. A May 2008 National Examiner article places the total program value at around $3.57 billion over all 3 increments.

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The GPS constellation needs to contain at least 24 evenly spaced satellites</span>, though 27 is preferred in order to maintain proper coverage around the globe from Medium Earth Orbit. <span style="font-size: 16px;">USAF Space Command wants to have at least 30,</span> in order <span style="font-size: 16px;">to ensure that a quick series of on-orbit satellite failures</span>, or problems caused by that orbit’s somewhat “dirty” status, d<span style="font-size: 16px;">on’t drop the constellation below</span> 27. Those failures are possible, as a look at the current constellation demonstrates. In 2008, there were 31 GPS satellites: <span style="font-size: 16px;">13 Block IIAs</span>. Intended design life: 7.5 years. Due to good design, redundant components, and clever adjustments, these satellites have lasted significantly longer than that; the record is about 17 years. <span style="font-size: 16px;">12 Block IIRs</span>. Intended design life: 10 years. At least one satellite is already beyond that. 21 GPS IIRs were built, of which 8 were modernized to GPS IIR-M status. <span style="font-size: 16px;">6 upgraded Block IIR-Ms</span>. Each IIR-M satellite includes a modernized antenna panel that provides increased signal power, 2 new military signals for improved accuracy to within 1 meter, enhanced military encryption and anti-jamming capabilities, and a 2nd civil signal (L2C) that will provide users with an open access signal on a different frequency. The additional signals make a difference, because it allows receivers to see the error created by the Earth’s ionosphere, and use advanced algorithms to refine positioning accuracy on that basis. <span style="font-size: 16px;">The final 2 GPS IIR-M</span>launches were put on “indefinite hold” in October 2008, due to issues with the Delta II launch rocket, but the 7th GPS IIR-M was launched in March 2009, and the 8th and final GPS IIR-M was launched in August 2009. The next set of launches after that will involve <span style="font-size: 16px;">Boeing’s Block IIF satellites.</span> Their improvements will include architecture updates, power, processor, and weight improvements, a 3rd civil signal (L5) in the aviation protection spectrum, which is expected to enable more widespread use of GPS for civil aviation air traffic control, and operational capability for a new military signal.
AND there’s already 28 more scheduled – only 8 have been cut – there evidence pre-dates budget cuts and assumes that no new satellites will be put up – that’s at least 61 sats without the plan

In English, this means that the entire constellation of GPS IIIB+ satellites will be updated at once from a single ground station, instead of having to wait for each satellite to orbit in view of a ground antenna as is currently the case. Up to 8 GPS-IIIB satellites are slated for launch. GPS Block IIIC satellites will add a high-powered spot beam to deliver greater M-Code power, better resistance to hostile jamming, and improved accuracy. Other technologies that become mature during the development period could also be added. //<span style="font-size: 16px;">The USAF intends to launch up to 16 GPS-IIIC satellites</span>////<span style="font-size: 16px;">. The first launch of a GPS-IIIA satellite is expected in 2014</span>//, with all 32 GPS Block III satellites expected to be on orbit by 2022. The current GPS III system design and development contract award will create about 500 new jobs for Lockheed Martin, and about 750 layoffs at Boeing. A May 2008 National Examiner article places the total program value at around $3.57 billion over all 3 increments.
Total cuts to GPS satellites are 5 million – that’s .0047% and it’s only cutting the Capability Insertion program – if by any miniscule chance they can create any specific advantages based off the capability insertion program or the Operational Control system – they don’t assume that the Air Force has lots of left over money from 2011 GPS budget

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The House recommended full funding for every DoD line item in the GPS program</span>. The Senate called for $64 million in cuts, consistent with actions taken by the Senate appropriators. <span style="font-size: 16px;">In reducing the advance procurement for GPS III,</span> Senate authorizers cited "Excess advance procurement—AF program change." Their report elaborates that, "<span style="font-size: 16px;">instead of buying long lead items for satellites 3, 4, and 5 in fiscal year 2011 as planned, the Air Force bought long lead items for only satellites 3 and 4. As a result of these actions and a reprogramming in fiscal year 2011, </span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">the program has excess money</span>//." (View source) The <span style="font-size: 16px;">report also indicates a $122.49 million reduction to GPS III procurement, but offsets it with an equivalent increase to the request amount.</span> This is an accounting practice to convert advance procurement funds from FY 2011 into regular procurement funds for FY 2012. Finally, the Senate reduced OCX, citing "Slow execution." The conference committee supported the Senate cut to OCX, again citing "Slow execution." //<span style="font-size: 16px;">The conferees rejected the Senate's cut to GPS III procurement but trimmed GPS III development, citing "GPS III CIP—poor justification</span>//<span style="font-size: 16px;">". CIP stands for Capability Insertion Program</span>. Sources for these quotes are in the table above.
