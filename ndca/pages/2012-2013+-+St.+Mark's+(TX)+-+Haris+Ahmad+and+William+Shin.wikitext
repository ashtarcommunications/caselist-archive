=Affirmative= 
==AFF - Disabilities== 
===1AC Hockaday=== 
====Advantage 1 is Aesthetics==== 

Aesthetic judgments order and give meaning to our understanding of class, race, and sex – the status quo has alienated the aesthetic of the disabled which denies them agency

Siebers 10 <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Disability Aesthetics" Tom Siebers, Tobin, Prof of Literary and Cultural Criticism at the U of Michigan, 2010)</span>

Oppression is the systematic victimization of one group by another. It is a form
AND
represents at this moment in time the final frontier of justifiable human inferiority.

Aesthetic agency should be debate~’s top priority

Nieutvenhuis 10<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Prof Jan Nieutvenhuis, Dept of Education Management and Policy Studies, Faculty of Education, University of Pretoria, "Acta Academica 2011: 43(1)," http://upza.academia.edu/JanNieuwenhuis/Papers/882363/Social_justice_in_education_today, woojae)</span>

Accept the geo-historical context of the struggle as something that must be reconciled
AND
to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.

Those aesthetics permeate our discussions of transportation infrastructure. The AFF is a FORCED, VIOLENT confrontation with disability which is key to shaping our understanding of aesthetics and form
Siebers 10 **(Tobin, professor of English, University of Michigan, Disability Aesthetics, pgs 58-63)**

These two episodes may seem worlds apart, their resemblance superficial. The first turns
AND
kids that do weird things. (Cited by Fine and Asch 48)

The aesthetic lack motivates eugenics from the fear of incompetence

Wilson 06 <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Daniel J., Cultural Locations of Disability, October 8)</span>

In two chapters on the eugenics movement, Snyder and Mitchell ~’analyze eugenics is
AND
medicine have considered disability as abnormal and in need of repair or elimination.

This projection is the root cause of genocidal violence

Elden 02<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Politics at University of Warwick, Stuart Boundary 2 29.2) </span>

The reverse side is the power to allow death. State racism is a recoding
AND
men to be killed. (VS, 180; WK, 136)

====Advantage 2 is Exclusion==== 

Seemingly innocuous investment decisions in transportation infrastructure have relegated people with disabilities to the periphery
**AAPD 12 (The American Association of People With Disabilities, "Equity in Transportation for People with Disabilities", May 23, http://www.infrastructureusa.org/equity-in-transportation-for-people-with-disabilities/)**

Transportation and mobility play key roles in the struggle for civil rights and equal opportunity
AND
on accessible taxis, a lack of requirements has meant very uneven progress.

When mobility is viewed as a universal characteristic individual problems become de-characterized and the focus degenerates to anesthetization and exclusion of bodies – that~’s how status quo transportation planning functions – it is entrenched in a universal model of ableism
**Imrie 2K**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> - Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London (Rob Disability and discourses of mobility and movement Environment and Planning volume 32 http://www.environmentandplanning.com/epa/fulltext/a32/a331.pdf)</span>

Barnes et al (1999, page 121), for instance, note that UK
AND
of mobility as ``a messy, unpredictable, diverse and changeable reality~’~’.

Mobility should not focus on a body~’s incompetence and shift away from the static hegemonic conception of liberal identity that recognizes differences – it should target individual needs of mobility
Imrie 2K **(Rob, Prof. of Geography @ King~’s College London and PhD in industrial sociology- Imrie is a fmr. Prof. of Human Geography at Royal Holloway London, awarded the "back award" by the Royal Geographical Society, Prof. at the Urban Research Centre, fmr. University of Western Sydney visiting professor, and on the editorial board of ~’Access Journal~’, Environment and Planning A 2000, Vol. 32, p. 1641-1656)**

Disabled people~’s mobility and movement are highly circumscribed by sociocultural attitudes, practices, and
AND
are demanding, not to have their needs defined and met by others~’~’.

The function of universalism is always already based on liberal notions of impairment – that does ontic violence to the disabled body which is a prior question
Hughes 07 <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Head of Division of Sociology Glasgow Caledonian University Bill Being disabled: towards a critical social ontology for disability studies Disability %26 Society 22.7 Taylor %26 Francis)</span>

In summary, the universalistic approach to ontology in disability studies that I have sketched
AND
p. 164) that regularly misrepresent and sometimes destroy disabled people~’s lives.

It also puts the fear of death onto the body of the disabled – which results in the invalidation and corruption of identity and life
Hughes 07<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Bill Head of Division of Sociology Glasgow Caledonian University "Being disabled: towards a critical social ontology for disability studies Disability %26 Society" 22.7)</span>

Indeed, the invulnerable self is a fantasy and form of self‐deception associated
AND
fantasy of absolute able bodiedness~’ (Thomson, 1997, p. 45).

The plan breaks down the societal barriers that oppose immobility and repairs ontic negativism
Imrie 2K<span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Department of Geography, Royal Holloway, University of London Rob Disability and discourses of mobility and movement Environment and Planning volume 32http://www.environmentandplanning.com/epa/fulltext/a32/a331.pdf) </span>

Mobility and movement are core to people~’s identities, life experiences, and opportunities.
AND
for challenging the hegemonic discourses of the body, mobility, and movement.

Infrastructure is NECESSARY to change design
Imrie 96 <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Professor in Human Geography, Department of Geography, Royal Holloway University of London, Rob, 1996 " Inclusive design, disability and the built environment," http://www.etn-presco.net/workshop/presentations/R_Imrie.pdf, woojae)</span>

While the barriers to disabled people~’s inclusion in the built environment are many and varied
AND
dropped kerbs and tactile surfaces on completion of regular repair or service work.

====Plan==== 
And Thus, the Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure accessibility investment.

====Contention 3 is solvency==== 

Federal action is key – devolving authority is an act of dismissing responsibility – this form of politics leads to serial policy failure

Fine and Hall 10 <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Prof of Economics U of London %26 Director of the Public Services International Research Unit – U of Greenwich, Contesting Neoliberalism: Public Sector Alternatives for Service Delivery Working Paper for the Milan European Economy Workshops 2010 http://www.economia.unimi.it/uploads/wp/DEAS-2010_27wp.pdf)</span>

Other areas of policymaking, as with industrial and regional policy, health, education
AND
most obviously in the collaboration between companies, donors and development banks over privatisations

Securitization creates cycles of enemy creation and makes death inevitable
Der Derian 98<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> pol sci prof odes Scholar at Oxford University and pol sci prof at Brown. Visiting scholar at the University of Southern California, MIT, Harvard, Oxford, and the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton (James, "The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard," On Security—Lipuschutz, http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html, AMiles)</span>

No other concept in international relations packs the metaphysical punch, nor commands the disciplinary
AND
made and millions killed while scientific knowledge has been furthered and intellectual dissent muted

Security is a tool of the biopolitical empire used to cast the disability to the periphery – that recreates problems

McRuer 10 <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Robert, Professor of English and Deputy Chair of the Department of English at George Washington University, "Disability Nationalism in Crip Times")</span>

Murderball, however, is just one prominent sign—whether marking at this point
AND
thought and action, for solidarity and coalition. ~~[End Page 176~~]
