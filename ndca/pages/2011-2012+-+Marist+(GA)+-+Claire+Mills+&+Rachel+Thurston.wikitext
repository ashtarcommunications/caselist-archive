<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But of course, those drives and those conceptual dichotomies are part of the very structure of our self-understanding both as individuals and as a tradition and a civilization. Hence, Heidegger's call is a threatening one, requiring great courage, "the courage to make the truth of our own presuppositions and the realm of our own goals into the things that most deserve to be called in question."3 Heidegger's work pushes thinking to think through the assumptions that underlie both our ecological vandalism and our love of scientific solutions, assumptions that also ground the most basic patterns of our current ways of being human.</span>

===Race K (read vs race affs)=== 
A. The Line ----- American society revolves around the colorline – an imaginary border separating white from black to generate pleasure and maintain the fantasy of race. The affirmative reifies this dangerous fantasy by accepting race as a natural form of being rather than a power relationship.

And, the call for racial equality is a call for enslavement – ambiguities and the label of a negative attractor puts the subjugated in the situation of the slave. The affirmative’s call for equal rights is nothing more than the disguised desire for slavery.

===Security K=== 
**Security is not a goal, but a set of typical actions and justifications offered for those actions.
