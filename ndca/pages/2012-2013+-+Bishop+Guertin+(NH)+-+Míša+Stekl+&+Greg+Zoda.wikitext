We’ll isolate two existential scenarios

First is biological terrorism

An attack is inevitable and we’re vulnerable
Ambrose 11 (Jay Ambrose, columnist for Scripps Howard News Service, internally quoting Colonel Randall Larsen, director of The Institute of Homeland Security among a host of other credentials establishing him as one of the most credible voices in the nation on terrorism risks; “Killing bin Laden doesn't end terrorist threat,” 5/3/2011, http://www.courierpress.com/news/2011/may/03/terror/)
We therefore must remain keenly vigilant as we also grasp that nuclear attack is not hazard number one,… now? An estimate of readiness last year was that we flunk.



Bioterror is probable and worse than nuclear war – advances in biomanufacturing key to solve
Maurer 7 (Stephen M. Maurer, J.D. Director of the Goldman School Project at the University of California, Berkeley on Information Technology and Homeland Security LIFEBOAT FOUNDATION BIOSHIELD HTTP://LIFEBOAT.COM/EX/BIO.SHIELD 2007)

It goes global – no generic defense

The smallpox virus is stable in aerosol form and has an infectious incubation period of seven to… dispensers of aerosolized bioweapons without anyone noticing.



It’s an existential threat
Matheny 7 - MPH from Johns Hopkins, PhD Candidate @ Johns Hopkins (Jason, research associate with the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, where his work focuses on technology forecasting and risk assessment - particularly of global catastrophic risks and existential risks.[1] He previously worked for the World Bank, the Center for Biosecurity, the Center for Global Development, and on national security projects for the US government. He is a Sommer Scholar and PhD candidate in Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University. He holds an MPH from Johns Hopkins, an MBA from Duke University, and a BA from the University of Chicago, Department of Health Policy and Management, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, “Reducing the Risk of Human Extinction,” http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/pmpmta/Mahoney_extinction.pdf)
Of current extinction risks, the most severe may be bioterrorism. The knowledge needed to engineer… support for such experiments because the benefits do not seem to be worth the risks.



Manufacturing solves bioterror
a. Bio-manufacturing
Morgan et al 3 (Sarah Morgan East Texas Baptist University, Silverio Colon, Arizona State University Department of Bioengineering College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Judith A. Ruffner and John A. Emerson Organic Materials Department, Ramona L. Myers Nuclear Safety Assessment Department; “Biomanufacturing: A State of the Technology Review “September 2003, http://www.che.ncsu.edu/academics/concentrations/documents/Biomanufacturing-AStateofTechRev.pdf)
Perhaps the most unique and advantageous aspect of biomanufacturing is the excellent control that may… Sandia National Laboratories has the expertise to contribute to any one of these fields.



b. Pharmaceuticals – the plan bolsters them

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers are joining forces… Knowledge is our best weapon against this invisible enemy."



Scenario two is superintelligence

Advanced R&D steers the robotics industry to develop it
Moravec 2k (Hans P. Moravec, Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA; “The Age of Robots,” 5/18/2000, pg. 141-142)
Like basic food in today' s developed countries, common manufactured goods in the next century will be… human minds and manipulate them with subtle cues and nudges, like adults redirecting toddlers.



Independently, convergence of advanced manufacturing technology will create superintelligence – that makes war IMPOSSIBLE
Paone 9 (Chuck, 66th Air Base Wing Public Affairs for the US Air Force, 8-10-09, “Technology convergence could prevent war, futurist says,” http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123162500)
The convergence of "exponentially advancing technologies" will form a "super-intelligence" so… he says, even if people don't know it.



Superintelligence solves extinction and turns all their impacts
Bostrom 03 (Nick Bostrom, Director of the Oxford Future of Humanity Institute, Faculty of Philosophy at the Oxford University; “Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence,” 2003, http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html)
It is hard to think of any problem that a superintelligence could not either solve or at least help us solve…. and to living closer to our ideals.



No turns – super-intelligence will be an ethics virtuoso
Notaro and Russell 12 (Kris Notaro, BS in philosophy from Charter Oak State College and member of the Bertrand Russell Society, AND Bertrand Russell [internally quoted], British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, and social critic; “Was Bertrand Russell a Futurist?”, 6/4/2012, http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/notaro20120604) [Gender modified]
This is where the futurist think-tanks become very important. It is said that un-friendly super intelligent AI… is also true of a conscious computer with the capabilities of self learning they then become a non-threat.



We’ll be BFFs with it
Bostrom 03 (Nick Bostrom, Director of the Oxford Future of Humanity Institute, Faculty of Philosophy at the Oxford University; “Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence,” 2003, http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html)
If a superintelligence starts out with a friendly top goal, however, then it can be relied on to stay friendly,… since that would make it less likely that the current goals will be attained.



It mathematically decreases the likelihood of extinction
Walker and Hedden 9 (Mark Walker, assistant professor at New Mexico State University and the Richard L. Hedden Chair of Advanced Philosophical Studies; “H+: Ship of Fools: Why Transhumanism is the Best Bet to Prevent the Extinction of Civilization,” 2/5/2009, http://www.metanexus.net/essay/h-ship-fools-why-transhumanism-best-bet-prevent-extinction-civilization)
What Fukuyama fails to address in any systematic way is the fact that there are even greater dangers… chances of civilization surviving a steady-as-she-goes policy at less than 20%. But then, I am an optimist.



Lastly, super-intelligence is inevitable – the question is “Will we be too late?”
Bostrom 03 (Nick Bostrom, Director of the Oxford Future of Humanity Institute, Faculty of Philosophy at the Oxford University; “Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence,” 2003, http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html)
One consideration that should be taken into account when deciding whether to promote the development… care, as soon as possible.



===Framing=== 
Contention 2 is Framing

The role of the ballot is to reduce existential risk – that is a moral imperative

This potential climate disaster, popularized in Science in 1983, rested on the output of a one dimensional… small as to call the very term ‘nuclear winter’ into question.



Neither is global warming

Since 1930, excessive groundwater withdrawal has caused Tokyo to subside by as much as 15 feet…. that coping with climate change is something we know how to do.



Our model of debate is best – simulating governmental action is best for decisionmaking

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The defining characteristic of 21st century American life is Islamophobia. The political sphere has been emptied – fear of Muslims now transcends political affiliation. This xenophobic politics justifies the worst of orientalist violence – racism, internment, and torture come to be seen as acceptable – in Bush’s words, a “crusade” against Islam is made possible</span>**

In doing so we necessarily affirm all the Orientalism of macropolitical institutions – debaters constantly advocate essentialist literature which would have us expand the United States’ imperial power over the Middle East in addition to describing Muslims as terrorists who irrationally loathe the United States as a result of their “inane” values</span>**

===Advantage CP vs Pace LS=== 
**The United States federal government should**

**- not increase its investment in the United States Maritime Administration Title XI program for short sea transportation in the United States,**
**- not close shipyards,**
**- meet the recommendations of our NLUS evidence,**
**- and substantially increase the income tax rate for high-income taxpayers.**

**Plank 1 solves the economy**
**Johnson et. al, 10** (Andy, director of the national security program, Kyle Spector, policy advisor for the National Security Program, Kristina Lilac, works for the national security program, Third Way Publications, September 16, 2010, http://content.thirdway.org/publications/326/Third_Way_Memo_-_End_the_Embargo_of_Cuba.pdf, ADP)

Significant tax increases have been critical to past successful deficit reduction deals. Most … cost of any rate increases also needed to achieve fiscal sustainability.

===Plan PIC=== 
**Text: We affirm the entirety of the 1ac except for the plan text.**

**It’s net beneficial – it solves better because it doesn’t start at the place of the state or include the pretended fiated action we will get links to.**

**It’s legit – they get 100% of the plan to generate offense versus the cp, this is a necessary test against critical affirmatives.**

**There is no internal link between the plan text and the solvency.**
**Schlag 90** (Pierre Schlag, professor of law@ univ. Colorado, stanford law review, november, page lexis)
In fact, normative legal thought is so much … of its wonderful normative advice into effect.

**The assumption of 1AC solvency papers over the rough edges of the world with warm and fuzzy normative legal talk, emotionally disconnecting them from the implications of the speech act**
**Delgado 91** (richard delgado , colorado law professor, 139 pa. L. Rev. 933, april)
But what is the cash value of all this priest-talk in the law …clearest [*955] examples of this are found in cases where the Supreme Court has been faced with subsistence claims.

**They are more interested in playing hermeneutic games than engaging in politics, the preoccupation with pretending to be policymakers traps them in a spectator position and bars them from recognizing the bureaucratic violence of legal praxis.**
**Schlag 90** (Pierre Schlag, professor of law@ univ. Colorado, stanford law review, november, page lexis)
All of this can seem very funny. That's because it is very funny. It is also … constructions of bureaucratic practices -- academic and otherwise.

(Dr. Gordon, ISIS Briefing on Ballistic Missile Defence, “Missile Defence: Trans-Atlantic Diplomacy at a Crossroads”, No. 6 July, http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6.html)

A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions … in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.
===Stimulus=== 

**<span style="background-color: white;">Infrastructure spending multipliers will be negative – delay, lack of targeting, and permanence of infrastructure spending</span>**
