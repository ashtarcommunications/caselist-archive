<u>Two weeks ago, <strong>nine Afghan children between the ages of nine and fifteen were killed by a NATO strike after being mistaken for insurgents</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. General Petraeus issued an apology and promised to investigate the killings, but news of their deaths quickly sparked anti-U.S. protests. They were killed in the Pech Valley, an area of Afghanistan once considered vital to U.S. military strategy. But now the U.S. military will soon be withdrawing from the Pech Valley after realizing that our presence was destabilizing the area. </span><u>The reality is <strong>our presence</strong> is destabilizing more than the Pech Valley</u><u>— <strong>it’s propping up a corrupt regime and fueling an insurgency, all while Afghan’s see little to no improvement in their lives</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. And </span><strong><u>it’s destabilizing Americans at home</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. While vital services and benefits get cut — such as the Community Development Block Grants and the WIC program which provides low-income expecting mothers and infants with proper nutrition — we continue to fund an expensive war with no end in sight. Last Wednesday, joined by members of both parties including Representatives Ron Paul, Walter Jones, Pete Stark, Bob Filner, and Barbara Lee, I announced a new bill to bring an end to the war in Afghanistan by the end of this year. Our legislation invokes the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which, if enacted, would require the President to withdraw U.S. Armed Forces out of Afghanistan by December 31, 2011. This legislation has bi-partisan support, and, according to a recent Rasmussen poll, a majority of Americans want us out of Afghanistan by the end of the year. A vote will be held on Thursday. We could end the war this week</span><u>. There is simply <strong>no rationale for continuing American involvement with no end in sight, rising deaths for civilians</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and our brave soldiers, </span><strong><u>declining public sentimen</u></strong><u>t</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, and serious economic pain at home. Continuing our involvement in Afghanistan is not affordable, it’s not just, and it hurts American foreign policy interests. It’s time to go. While Congress pulls unemployment benefits from suffering Ohio families and proposes slashing health care benefits, vital children’s programs, and veterans’ services all because we’re “broke,” it continues to fund a war that has cost us more than $455 billion. We are told we should cut funding for assistance to low-income families with one hand, while with the other hand tens of billions of dollars are approved for a war that does nothing to further our national security</span><u>. The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation estimates that <strong>the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan cost the average American family of four almost $13,000 last year</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Our priorities are simply out of sync. Desperately needed unemployment benefits were filibustered last year because the costs to provide them were not offset with spending cuts or revenue increases. But we are not required to offset the costs of war, even when the war is completely funded by borrowed money – money we have to pay back with interest on the backs of our children and grandchildren. And we are spending all this money on a war that is a waste of time, blood, and treasure. And the situation is getting worse, not better. 2010 was the deadliest year of the entire campaign. 700 brave soldiers, mostly Americans, were killed. Civilian deaths are on the rise too — up 15% in 2010. As we approach the one-year anniversary of the commitment of an additional 30,000 troops and over $36 billion to the surge in Afghanistan, it is clear our strategy is not working. And we cannot afford to sustain it any longer. </span><u>The American people are being asked to shoulder the costs for wars that undermine our national, moral and economic security and opposition is growing</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. We must ask ourselves whose nation we are building when we ask people here at home to give up benefits they have earned in order to nation-build abroad.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Thus: </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military and police presence in Afghanistan and Iraq</span></strong>. <br />

<strong>The invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq cannot be separated from the dehumanizing discourse that created the immoral other as a threat in order to prop up American exceptionalism</strong> <br />
Anthony <strong>Burke 2004<u>,</u></strong> Senior Lecturer in International Relations at the University of New South Wales, [“Just War or Ethical Peace: Moral Discourses on War After 9/11</em>,<em>” </em>International Affairs<em>, 80 (2), 329-353]<br />
<br />
<strong><u>American anger in the wake of September 11 was expressed in two interwoven languages: morality and war</u></strong>. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">As Jean Bethke Elshtain describes it, ‘from George W. Bush to the average man and woman on the street, Americans since September 11 have invoked the language of justice to characterise their collective response to the despicable deeds perpetrated against innocent men, women and children.’17 </span><u>George W. Bush told Congress</u> that on September 11 ‘enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country’ and promised <strong><u>that ‘whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done</u></strong>.’<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> He claimed that the war against terror was ‘the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom’, and that ‘we are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to live by them. No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith.’18 </span><strong><u>This,</u></strong> <u>unmistakably, is a <strong>language of morality allied to a declaration and promise of war:</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">a declaration of the immorality of the attacks and their perpetrators, of the tolerance, fairness and purity of the United States and its allies, and of its moral duty to seek and live by principles of justice through military and other counterterrorist action.</span> <u>It <strong>is a language which creates an irrevocably divided moral universe, in which all virtue lies with the US and all iniquity with ‘the terrorists’</strong>,</u> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">set out starkly in the President’s description of Al-Qaeda and the Taleban as ‘the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the twentieth century … fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism’.19 </span><u>It is a language <strong>which sees force not merely as a rational response to a threat</strong> to American national security, <strong>but as a moral response to an act of injustice</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">—a response which it is moral to make, and which he implies should also be made in a moral way. In short,</span> <u>Bush’s address to Congress imagines a martial universe and a moral universe, and then unites them.</u> <u>What are the implications of doing so? How does it drive or enable policy, and what expectations might we have of that policy once it is couched in these terms</u><u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">?</span></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> The answers are complex and disturbing. Elshtain’s argument is that</span>, <u>by invoking the language of justice, Americans ‘tap into a complex tradition called “just war</u>”<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">’. In her view the war on terror is both a just cause and being fought according to just war principles: When a wound as grievous as that of September 11 has been inflicted on a body-politic, it would be the height of irresponsibility—a dereliction of duty, a flight from the serious vocation of politics—to fail to respond … A </em>political<em> ethic is an ethic of responsibility. The just war tradition gives us a way of exercising that responsibility.20</span><u>Elshtain is firm in her belief that the war on terror—even extended to Iraq— measures up to the standards of ‘just war’, in both its justification and its execution.</u> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Her argument is significant for the evaluation of the just war discourse, even though it can be challenged on a number of grounds, such as the reluctance of the US to explore alternatives to a war against Afghanistan, the conduct of US operations, and the naivety of her belief that the just war framework is the one actually being applied by the Bush administration. As Nicholas Wheeler notes, the administration tapped into more than the just war ‘tradition’ both in designing and in justifying its response; just war, he argues, jostled for space with ‘alternative moral theories that challenge the idea of restraint in war’ such as the ‘realist doctrine of necessity’, and the ‘supreme emergency’ and ‘war is hell’ arguments discussed by just war theorist Michael Walzer.21 Bush’s own rhetoric betrays this ambiguity, as when he stated in the address to Congress that ‘whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done.’22</span>‘<u>Bringing our enemies to justice’ implies using legal processes and neutral/universal standards of judgement; ‘bringing justice to our enemies’ suggests the use of extralegal means both to deal with a threat and to achieve ‘justice’. They are not the same, and the latter suggests that the use of extralegal violence or coercion (killing at a distance on the basis of minimal evidence or suspect intelligence, highly coercive interrogation techniques, and the long-term detention of suspects outside domestic or international law) may be both morally necessary and morally legitimate. The US has put great emphasis on this approach, as shown by the indefinite detention of prisoners at Camps Delta and X-Ray, the creation of special military tribunals to try terrorist suspects in the US (rather than either using its own civil courts or creating an international one), the bombing of Taleban and Al-Qaeda hideouts and positions, and the use of an unmanned Predator drone armed with Hellfire missiles to assassinate</u> six <u>Al-Qaeda ‘leaders’</u> in Yemen.23 On the other hand, as Wheeler suggests, the US did employ some <u>restraints on</u> its <u>bombing and targeting during Operation Enduring Freedom</u>—even if, as I will shortly suggest, these <u>failed to prevent a disturbingly high number of civilian casualties and other potential violations of the laws of war.</u><span style="font-size: 6.66667px;"> He argues that, ‘as in the Gulf War and Kosovo, collateral damage concerns were an integral part of the targeting process. Lawyers in the Pentagon and at the Combined Air Operations Centre at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia scrutinized targets for their legality under international humanitarian law.’24 This no doubt saved many lives, but we can reasonably suggest that comparisons with Operation Allied Force in Kosovo are misleading. As a Project on Defense Alternatives study (discussed below) shows, both total casualty rates and casualty rates per sortie were much higher in Afghanistan.25 <u>The conduct of US and allied forces in Afghanistan and Iraq is analysed</u> in detail below</span>. <u>What becomes clear from this examination is that ‘bringing justice to our enemies’ was the administration’s and the Pentagon’s primary response</u>; a response characterized by Michael Byers as <strong><u>part of an evolving pattern in which the US ‘is attempting to create new, exceptional rules for itself alone’</u></strong> and by Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na’im as <u>an ‘institutional and procedural failure of international legality’ that ‘promotes the cause of militant Islamic fundamentalism and undermines prospects of support for international peace and universal human rights in Islamic societies’</u>.26 <u>Such a disregard for international law is built upon a particularly claustrophobic idea of moral community; <strong>a bifurcated moral universe which casts the US and its allies as virtuous and its enemies as ineradicably threatening and evil.</strong></u> As Wheeler points out, <u>the <strong>administration’s rhetoric equating Al-Qaeda and the Taleban with Nazism suggested that they were being constructed as such a threat to human values,</strong> as did Vice-President Cheney’s statement that ‘We cannot deal with terror … the struggle can only end with their complete and permanent destruction.</u>’27<br />

<u>The war also displaced hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians not only from their homes but also from the protections of international law. They became the mute bearers of</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> what Agamben calls &quot;</span><u>bare life,&quot; excluded from both &quot;politically qualified life&quot; and, in many cases, from the actions of international aid agencies or even the scrutiny of the international media</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">.' At the very beginning of the conflict, Felicity Lawrence drew attention to the absence of images of its victims. There were already vast numbers of refugees without food, water or medicine, she wrote, but within the space of constructed invisibility: [We] can't see them; they have no face. They have not so far massed shock-ingly in front of the cameras, because the borders to neighbouring coun-tries remain closed. They have fled to villages in the mountains, where aid agencies fear they will starve slowly, in pockets, away from the fences where photographers can bear witness.&quot;' Lawrence's sense of this first phase of the attack on Afghanistan as &quot;a war depersonalized and a narrative detached&quot; eventually gave way, however, as the different imaginative geographies being mobilized by America and its allies confounded and ultimately perforated one another.</span><strong><u>The military assault could never be confined</u></strong><u>to the sanitized, surgical procedures con-jured up by Bush's &quot;<strong>carefully targeted actions</strong></u><strong>,</strong><strong>&quot;</strong><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> and most of the Afghan people were never able to appreciate what he called &quot;the generosity of America and [its] allies.&quot; &quot;</span><u>As we strike military targets,&quot; <strong>the president had reassured his audience before the bombing began, &quot;we will also drop food, medicine and supplies</strong> to the starving and suffering men and women and children of Afghanistan.&quot;' This was a tacit admission that territorialization was an imperfect schematic, and that &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; and &quot;Afghanistan&quot; were not coincident</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. Indeed, </span><u>Zizek suggested that &quot;perhaps <strong>the ultimate image of the 'local population' as homo sacer is that of the American war plane flying above Afghanistan: one can never be sure whether it will be dropping bombs or food parcels</strong></u><strong>.&quot;</strong><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">'s The strategy was a cruel tokenism. The parcels were intended primarily for domestic consumption — and perhaps to rally America's allies — since the airdrops were so pitifully inadequate to the scale of the swelling hu-manitarian crisis.' But historian Niall Ferguson none the less approvingly quoted Kipling's White Man's Burden. America was waging a &quot;savage war of peace,&quot; he wrote, while filling &quot;full the mouths of Famine.&quot; And he tried to silence any dissenters by declaring that &quot;Kipling would certainly have grasped the rationale of simultaneously dropping cluster bombs and food parcels,&quot; which makes one wonder if the appalling man had any idea of the sheer number of those &quot;mouths of Famine&quot; or what cluster bombs do.&quot; </span><u>For the record: each cluster bomb contains several hundred bomblets, and when each bomblet explodes hundreds of steel fragments shoot out at high velocity to kill or maim anyone within a radius of 100 meters from the point of detonation. <strong>Those that do not explode lie buried in the earth,</strong> even more dangerous than conventional land-mines: all the more so in Afghanistan since many of them were yellow — <strong>the same color as the food parcels</strong></u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">.' &quot;Territory,&quot; as Homi Bhabha once observed in a remark that Kipling would no doubt also have endorsed, derives from both terra (earth) and terrere (to frighten), from which we derive territoriurn, &quot;a place from which people are frightened off.&quot;' And so it proved, as the crumpled folds between al-Qaeda and Afghanistan came undone. As the re-empowered Northern Alliance swept south, supported by massive high-level aerial bombardments, so streams of refugees headed for the borders, terrified by the prospect of another round of death and destruction. Many of them, disaffected with the Taliban, had suffered vicious reprisals from the retreating troops, but — as my narrative in the previous chapter has shown — they also had good reason to fear the Northern Alliance once again ruling their lives.&quot; During the night of November 12/13 the Taliban abandoned Kabul, and the next day the city was occupied by Alliance troops. John Lee Anderson, a reporter for the New Yorker, surveyed what he called &quot;a Daliesque panorama of wholesale destruction&quot;; Kabul had been battered by so many different warlords that &quot;all of the devastation had a name attached to it&quot; (figure 4.5). By December 22 a new, interim administration had been installed in the capital, but this did not end the fighting or the suffering of the civilian population. This was in part the consequence of the sheer scale of devastation. Anderson described &quot;a vast mud Chernobyl&quot; stretch-ing north across the Shamali plain from Kabul to the former front line, pockmarked by &quot;roofless and crumbling adobe farm houses, collapsed walls and battered fields.&quot; But the continued humanitarian crisis was also the product of the US decision to rely on the militias of the Northern Alliance for most of the ground fighting. Millions of dollars were expended in whole-sale bribery to persuade them to fight the Taliban, which minimized American casualties but also ensured that the warlordism that had dis-figured Afghanistan for decades would resurface as soon as their oppon-ents had fled. Human Rights Watch documented appalling atrocities inflicted by these militias on Pashtun civilians in particular: extortions and looting, sexual violence, beatings, and killings.&quot;</span><u>The high-level war from the air also took a heavy toll of the popula-tion. By May 2002 it was estimated that 1,300-3,500 civilians had died and 4,000-6,500 civilians had been injured, many of them seriously, as a direct result of American bombs and missiles</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> (figure 4.6). Probably </span><u>another 20,000 civilians lost their lives as an indirect consequence of the American-led intervention; this includes thousands who died when relief columns from international aid agencies were halted or delayed, and others who died through the secondary effects of targeting civilian infrastructure</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> (especially electrical power facilities vital for hospitals and water-supply systems).' </span><u>Most of these men, women, and <strong>children were killed</strong> or maimed &quot;<strong>not by design</strong></u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">,&quot; as a horrified Noam Chomsky put it, &quot;</span><strong><u>but because it [did not] matter&quot;: &quot;a deeper level of moral depravity&quot; mined by the ghosts of homo sacer.&quot; The numbers of these nameless victims</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> and what Marc Herold grimly calls their &quot;unworthy bodies&quot; do matter. But they </span><u>matter not because &quot;deaths <strong>directly attributable to US foreign policies are to be weighed against the deaths the US has suffered, somehow leaving the recip-ients of its imperial and post-colonial aggression in moral cre</strong></u><strong>dit<u>.&quot; It is not about making cruel comparisons,</u></strong> <u>which is exactly what</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> Arundhati </span><u>Roy criticized as the algebra of infinite justice: &quot;How many dead Afghans for every dead American?&quot; <strong>Insisting instead on the absolute significance of these deaths disrupts those simultaneous equations and unsettles</strong></u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> what Gilroy calls &quot;</span><strong><u>the imperial topography which dictates that deaths are prized</u></strong> <u>according to where they occur and the [racial markings] of the bodies involved.&quot;' We need to record these numbers, and to think about the destroyed lives that they represent even in excess of these numbers, the friends and families pummeled by inconsolable loss, because no sup-posedly &quot;sacred mission</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">&quot; — jihad or crusade — </span><u>can provide a warrant for this indiscriminate killing</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. In all of these ways, then, </span><u>the imaginative geographies of a colonial past reasserted themselves in the colonial present.</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> What Gilroy describes, appropriately, as at once &quot;</span><strong><u>old,</u></strong><u>modern <strong>notions of racial difference&quot; were activated within a differential calculus according to which &quot;some human bodies are more easily and appropriately humiliated, imprisoned, shack-led, starved and destroyed than others</strong></u><strong>.</strong><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">&quot; He continues: These fine ethnic distinctions effectively revive a colonial economy in which infrahumanity, measured against the benchmark of healthier imperial standards, diminishes human rights and can defer human recognition. </span><u>The native, the enemy, the prisoner and all the other shadowy &quot;third things&quot; lodged between animal and human can only be held accountable under special emergency rules and fierce martial laws. Their lowly status underscores the fact that they cannot be reciprocally endowed with the same vital humanity enjoyed by their well-heeled captors, conquerors, judges, executioners and other racial betters.&quot; The sovereign powers and delegations that decreed that the lives and deaths of all these people were of no account — who claimed to wage a war of &quot;civilization&quot; against &quot;barbarism&quot; within the spaces of their own excep-tion — must surely be called to account and made to reflect on the mean-ings of the wretched colonial antinomies through which they preach vengeance and retribution</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">In this light, </span><strong><u>we can see the invasion of Iraq as continuing a long process of ‘worldhistorical’ violence</u></strong> <u>that stretches back to Columbus’ discovery of the Americas</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">, </span><u>and <strong>the subsequent politics of genocide, warfare and dispossession through which the modern United States was created</strong> and then expanded</u><u>*<span style="color: #ffffff;">/</span>initially with <strong>the colonisation of the Philippines and coercive trade relationships with China and Japan</strong>, and eventually to the self-declared role Luce had argued so forcefully for: guarantor of global economic and strategic order after 1945.</u><u>That this role involved the hideous destruction of Vietnam and Cambodia, ‘<strong>interventions’ in Chile, El Salvador, Panama, Nicaragua, and Afghanistan</strong></u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> (or an ever more destructive ‘strategic’ involvement in the Persian Gulf that saw the US first building up Iraq as a formidable regional military power, and then punishing its people with a fourteen-year sanctions regime that caused the deaths of at least two-hundred thousand people) </span><strong><u>we are meant to accept as proof of America’s benign intentions</u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, </span><u>of America putting its ‘power at the service of principle’</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. </span><u>They are merely History working itself out, the ‘design of nature’ writing its bliss on the world</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> (quotes from Bush, Remarks at the National Endowment for Democracy, 6 November 2003</span><u>). <strong>But this freedom offers us the bliss of the graveyard</strong>, stretching endlessly into a world marked not by historical perfection or democratic peace but by the eternal recurrence of tragedy, as ends endlessly disappear in the means of permanent war and permanent terror</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. </span><u>This is how we must understand both the awesome horror visited on the people of Iraq since 1990, and <strong>the inflammatory impact the US invasion will have on the new phenomenon of global anti-western terrorism</strong>.</u><u>American exceptionalism has deluded US policymakers into believing they are the only actors who write history, who know where it is heading, how it will play out, and that in its service it is they</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> (and no-one else</span><u>) who assume an unlimited freedom to act.</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> Osama bin Laden and his many supporters do not accept the American narrative of power in the service of principle; they see merely power in the service of power, and derive from it a lesson that it is both necessary and legitimate to respond with a commensurate violence. As Bin Laden said in his chilling 1998 interview with John Miller, who asked him if his ‘fatwa’ calling on all Muslims to kill Americans extended to all Americans: We are surprised this question is coming from Americans. Each action will solicit a similar reaction. We must use such punishment to keep your evil away from Muslims . . . America does not have a religion that prevents it from destroying all people. . . . The prophet said: ‘A woman entered hell because of a cat’. She did not feed it and blocked it from finding food on its own. She is going to hell for blocking a cat to death, but [what do you] say to those who agreed and gave reason for the hundreds of thousands of troops to blockade millions of Muslims in Iraq?

[the] foundational transgression of human hubris’ (Euben, 2000). The narrative of freedom that Bush speaks (and the US armed forces enact) has already been written and interpreted in fundamentalist thought, with a starkly different meaning from that Bush seeks to convey, one further transformed by every American action in Iraq and throughout the Middle-East. The Bush Administration’s April 2004 endorsement*</span><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 9.33333px;">/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">in pointed defiance of countless UN resolutions on the issue*</span><span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 9.33333px;">/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">of the Israeli government’s unilateral plan under the guise of ‘disengagement’ to impose a grossly unjust ‘final settlement’ on the Palestinians, one that will undermine any possibility of meaningful self-determination, is just such an example of arrogance and hubris that will deepen Islamic hatred of the West and rebound upon it in new acts of terror (MacAskill, 2004, p. 1). </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">This US gesture</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">, </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">portrayed throughout the Arab world as a new ‘Balfour declaratio</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">n’, is yet another example of the callous, </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">‘strategic’ use of instrumental reason that treats the Palestinian people as so much human cattle who can be contained and corralled</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;">, </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">and whose destiny can be decided by a handful of men in Jerusalem and Washington</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;"> (Howeidy, 2004; see also Katib, 2004; Alpher, 2004; Beilin, 2004). </span><strong><u><span style="color: #000000;">The arguments of Bin Laden and Bush have one important thing in common: they betray the same deluded, claustrophobic commitment to the easy translation of means into ends</span></u></strong><u><span style="color: #000000;">,</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 9.33333px;"> as if either of their policies could protect Muslims, ensure the security of Americans, or bring about the utterly irreconcilable ‘ends’ of history they seek (‘Freedom’ fights the ‘Caliphate’, like Punch and Judy dolls squabbling on the arms of History). Nothing has been more detrimental to the livelihood and future of Muslims than Al-Qaeda’s campaign of terror, and nothing has been more detrimental to future global security than the invasion of Iraq, yet we are locked in a terrible hall of mirrors where each discourse makes the other meaningful, and each act precipitates the next (as the latter-day Isaac Newton says, ‘each action will solicit a similar reaction’) (Miller, 1998b). </span><strong><u><span style="color: #000000;">As we count the enormous toll of dead and wounded in Iraq, and ponder the abyss of violence</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="color: #000000;">,</span></u></strong><u><span style="color: #000000;"> frustration and insecurity into which it has slipped since the fall of Saddam Hussein, the times more than ever call for the insight of a Hannah Arendt.

It begins by outlining the discursive structures of Orientalism and goes on to examine their resonance and continuity in stories covered by The Gazette. This newspaper's peculiar location and status as the major English daily newspaper in a Francophone environment with a large Muslim population makes it a valuable object of analysis. It provides an avenue by which to understand the various ways in which the media rework and refract dominant discourses of race and racism.Edward Said's significant contribution in defining the organizational features of Orientalism and examining it as a discursive regime has been critiqued by feminists on the grounds that it does not address the issue of sexuality adequately, and that it tends to be a totalizing discourse devoid of any spaces of resistance or counter discourses. Nevertheless, I still find Said's definition of Orientalism to be a useful point of departure for the present inquiry.</span><u>Orientalism</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, according to Said, </span><u>is a generic term … to describe the Western approach to the Orient;</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Orientalism is the discipline by which the Orient was (and is) approached systematically, as a topic of learning, discovery and practice. </span><u>But in addition … the word [<strong>Orientalism</strong> can be used] to designate the collection of dreams, images and vocabularies available to anyone who has tried to talk about what lies East</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> of the dividing line. </span><u>In this sense, Orientalism describes</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> a mlange of </span><u>diverse approaches and perspectives</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> that are </span><u>unified bya Western gaze</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and sedimented through historical references to other works that assume a coherence of sorts. </span><u>Or, as Foucault would suggest, Orientalism <strong>constitutes a regime of truth based on an authoritative corpus of knowledge</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. For Said, then, the Orient is: less a place than a topos, a set of references, a congeries of characteristics, that seems to have its origin in a quotation, or a fragment of a text, or a citation from someone's work on the Orient, or some bit of previous imagining, or an amalgam of all these. Direct observation or circumstantial description of the Orient are the fictions presented by writing on the Orient, yet invariably these are totally secondary to systematic tasks of another sort.5 </span><u>The discursive regime of Orientalism</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> overlaps with and </span><strong><u>is derived from discourses of colonialism and imperialism</u></strong><u>.</u> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Hence, </span><u>commonalities with these discursive traditions lie in the binary oppositions that form</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and inform the power coordinates of </span><u>these 'regimes of truth.'These include a perception of cultural practices</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> as indicative of inherent and innate traits<strong>,</strong> </span><strong><u>a collapsing of differences between subject peoples so that they appear as monoliths, and taxonomies of knowledge that situate subject peoples in</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> particular relations of </span><u>inferiority</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> that then are naturalized. </span><u>In terms of</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> the tradition of </span><u>Orientalism, then, the Orient is a place of mystery and danger</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> with the Orientalized body discursively situated within this landscape<strong>,</strong> </span><strong><u>serving to legitimize</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and naturalize </span><strong><u>unequal power relations</u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span><u>The Orientalized body becomes a projection of all that the West finds strange</u></strong><u>, alien and abhorrent, but simultaneously exotic, inviting and alluring.

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Language and Politics: Why Words Matter How does language co-constitute reality? Why are words so important to political analysis? The answer can be simply stated: </span><strong><u>language is never neutral</u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">; </span><u>words</u></strong><strong><u>don’t just describe the world, they</u></strong> <u>actually help to <strong>make it</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. As such, language can never be employed in a purely objective sense. There are several reasons for this. In the first place, as linguists and anthropologists have discovered, </span><u>all language has a basic binary structure such that almost every noun, adjective and verb has its direct opposite</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. It is a feature of the underlying architecture of language. Critically, </span><strong><u>this opposition between terms usually implies a ‘devaluation of one term</u></strong> <u>and a favoring of the other.</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">’</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn8" rel="nofollow">__[8]__</a><u>The natural inequality where one term is lacking something the opposite embodies is rarely questioned or challenged</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Some of the well-known examples of the way the binary system works include: </span><u>good/evil,</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> love/hate, new/old, normal/deviant, primitive/modern, native/foreigner, and west/east. </span><strong><u>Speaking about ‘civilisation’</u></strong> <u>for example</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> (as in ‘terrorism threatens our civilisation’), </span><u>is <strong>impossible without</strong> bringing to mind the concept of <strong>‘barbarism’</strong> as its negative opposite.</u> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Second<strong>,</strong> </span><strong><u>language plays an active role</u></strong> <u>in creating and <strong>changin</strong>g perceptions<strong>, cognition</strong> and emotions.</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> As something particularly human, language moulds how we see the worl</span><strong><u>d; it is the main determinant of our perceptions and our access to concrete reality</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. From knowing the difference between an apple and a hand grenade, to knowing what to do with each in relevant situations, language shapes our understanding of the world around us.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn9" rel="nofollow">__[9]__</a><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> More than affecting perceptions, </span><u>language also structures cognition—it <strong>affects the way we</strong> think, and particularly how we <strong>make strategic choices</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span><u>By using a restricted set of words and word formations, some choices can appear perfectly reasonable and commonsensical while others appear absurd.</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Expressed another way, </span><strong><u>the language we use at any given moment privileges one viewpoint over others</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, naturalising some understandings as rational and others as nonsensical.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn10" rel="nofollow">__[10]__</a><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> As a consequence, language also affects our emotions. </span><u>It is in an important sense, <strong>the place where our psychic and social lives intersect</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span><strong><u>Certain words</u></strong> <u>or combinations of words can <strong>make us feel anxious</strong>, fearful, angry or joyful. This <strong>generates immense power for those that deploy the</strong></u><strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">m</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Politicians, propagandists and advertisers have known this for a long time, and in fact, we see it almost every day in people’s reactions to the use of certain words in the media, such as ‘paedophile’, ‘AIDS’, ‘humanitarian disaster’, ‘murder’, ‘weapons of mass destruction’ and ‘terrorist’. A third reason why words cannot be considered neutral is because words have histories. In themselves, </span><u>words</u> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">have no inherent meaning; rather, they </span><u>have to acquire meaning in their own discursive setting.</u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn11" rel="nofollow">__[11]__</a><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">The process by which words obtain meaning is often lengthy and takes place through repetition and their careful and selective use in specific contexts. For example, the use of the terms ‘civilised’ and ‘barbarous’ cannot avoid invoking the history of these words as they were applied by Christian Europe in the Middle Ages, and by imperialists and colonists in the nineteenth century. </span><u>There is a history to their meaning t</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">hat affects their usage in a contemporary context. In other cases, words can take on new meanings through specific forms of usage.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn12" rel="nofollow">__[12]__</a><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Because words have histories, the act of naming things is always a highly charged process that can have serious political and social consequences. </span><u>This effect of <strong>naming is</strong> especially <strong>powerful in terms of political violence</strong> because, for example, to <strong>‘call an act of political violence terrorist is not merely to describe it but to judge it.</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">’</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn13" rel="nofollow">__[13]__</a><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Consider the difference between calling the killing of an abortion doctor ‘a murder’ and calling it ‘an act of terrorism’; the two names for the same act have very contrasting meanings and would likely elicit very different responses from both the public and the authorities. The methodological approach I have employed to examine the official language of the ‘war on terrorism’ is known broadly as critical discourse analysis. This approach is at once both a technique for analysing specific texts or speech acts, and a way of understanding the relationship between discourse and social and political phenomena. By engaging in concrete, linguistic textual analysis—that is, by doing systematic analyses of spoken and written language—</span><u>critical discourse analysis aims to shed light on the links between texts and societal practices and structures, or, the linguistic-discursive dimension of social action</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn14" rel="nofollow">__[14]__</a><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> The approach is based on a number of crucial assumptions. It assumes that discourse is a form of social practice which both makes or constitutes the social world, and is at the same time constituted by other social practices. </span><strong><u>Discourses both contribute to the shaping of social structures and are also shaped by them; there is a <em>dialectical</em> relationship between the two</u></strong><u>.</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Of even greater import, critical discourse analysis assumes that </span><u>discursive practices</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> are never neutral, but rather they </span><u>contribute to the creation and reproduction of unequal power relations between social groups.</u> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">That is, discourses </span><u>possess a clear ideological character</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">; they are the construction and deployment of ‘meaning in the service of power.’</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn15" rel="nofollow">__[15]__</a><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Or, more specifically, discourses act as constructions of meaning that contribute to the production, reproduction and transformation of relations of domination in society.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn16" rel="nofollow">__[16]__</a><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Thus, a central aim of critical discourse analysis lies in revealing the means by which language is deployed to maintain power. What makes critical discourse analysis ‘critical’ is its normative commitment to positive social change.</span><br />

<strong>The war on terror has become de-historicized- the colonial invocation of American identity serves to forces a manipulated sequence in political thinking which mask structural violence – the only use of threat discourse is to force a politics that accepts interventions and massive wars</strong> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Another ubiquitous feature of the discourse of the ‘war on terrorism’ is the scripting of a perpetual state of threat and danger. As David Campbell has eloquently shown, </span><strong><u>discourses of danger</u></strong> <u>and foreign threat have been <strong>integral in constituting</strong> and disciplining <strong>American identity</strong> as practiced through its foreign policy</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn37" rel="nofollow">__[37]__</a><u>Collectivities</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, especially those as disparate and diverse as America , </span><u>are often <strong>only unified by an external threat</strong> or danger;</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> in this sense, threat creation can be functional to political life. Historically, the American government has relied on the discourse of threat and danger on numerous occasions: </span><u>the ‘red scares’ of the native Americans who threatened the spread of peaceful civilization along the Western frontier, <strong>the workers’ unrest at the time of the Bolshevik</strong> Revolution, and the threat to the American way of life during the cold war<strong>; the threat of ‘rogue states’</strong> like Libya, Panama, Iran, North Korea, and Iraq; and <strong>the threats posed by the drug trade</strong>, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and now of course, terrorism</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span><u>These discourses of danger are scripted for the purposes of maintaining inside/outside, self/other boundaries—they write American identity—and for enforcing unity on an unruly and (dis)United States.</u> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Of course, there are other more mundane political functions for constructing fear and moral panic: provokngi and allaying anxiety to maintain quiescence, de-legitimizing dissent, elevating the status of security actors, diverting scarce resources into ideologically driven political projects, and distracting the public from more complex and pressing social ills.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn38" rel="nofollow">__[38]__</a><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> This is not to say that terrorism poses no real threat; the dangers can plainly be seen in the images of falling bodies and the piles of rubble at ‘Ground Zero’. Rather, it is to point out that </span><strong><u>dangers are those facets of social life interpreted as threats</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> (in one sense, dangers do not exist objectively, independent of perception), and </span><u>what is interpreted as posing a threat may not always correspond to the realities of the actual risk of harm.</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Illegal narcotics, for example, pose less of a risk than the abuse of legal drugs, but a ‘war on drugs’ makes it otherwise. </span><u>Similarly, the ‘</em>war on terrorism’<em> <strong>is a multi-billion dollar exercise to protect Americans from a danger that</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, excluding the September 11, 2001 attacks</span><u>, <strong>killed less people per year over several decades than bee stings and lightening strikes.</strong> Even in 2001, America ’s worst year of terrorist deaths, the casualties from terrorism were still vastly outnumbered by deaths from auto-related accidents, gun crimes, alcohol and tobacco-related illnesses, suicides, and a large number of diseases like influenza, cancer, and heart disease</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span><strong><u>Globally, terrorism</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, which kills a few thousand per year, pales into </span><strong><u>insignificance next to</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">the 40,000 people who die every day from hunger,</span> <u><strong>the half a million people who die every year from small wars,</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">the 150,000 annual deaths from increased diseases caused by global warming,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn39" rel="nofollow">[39</a>] and the millions who die from AIDS. And yet, the whole world is caught up in the global ‘war on terrorism’ whose costs so far run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. In other words, in a world of multiple threats, many of which pose a far greater risk to individual safety (according to Dr David King, Britain’s chief scientist, global warming is a greater threat to humanity than terrorism), </span><strong><u>the fact that terrorism is widely seen as posing the greatest and most immediate threat is due to the deliberate construction of a discourse of danger</u></strong><u>.</u> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">The initial construction of the threat of terrorism involved fixing the attacks of 9/11 as the start of a whole new ‘age of terror’, rather than as an extraordinary event, or an aberration (out of 18,000 terrorist attacks since 1968 only a dozen or so have caused more than 100 deaths; high-casualty terrorist attacks are extremely rare and 9/11 was the rarest of the rare). Instead, </span><u>the attacks were interpreted as the dawning of a new era of terrorist violence that knew no bounds.</u> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">As Bush stated, ‘All of this was brought upon us in a single day—and night fell on a different world’.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn40" rel="nofollow">__[40]__</a><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Vice-President Dick Cheney made it even clearer: Today, we are not just looking at a new era in national security policy, we are actually living through it. The exact nature of the new dangers revealed themselves on September 11, 2001 , with the murder of 3,000 innocent, unsuspecting men, women and children right here at home.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn41" rel="nofollow">__[41]__</a><u>This construct was only possible by severing all links between this act of terrorism and countless others that had preceded it, and by de-contextualizing it from the history of al Qaeda’s previous attacks</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. In effect, the events of ‘9/11’ were constructed without a pre-history; </span><strong><u>they stand alone as a defining day of cruelty</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and evil (‘infamy’). </span><strong><u>This break with the past makes it possible to assign it future significance as the start of ‘super-terrorism’</u></strong><u>, ‘catastrophic terrorism’, or simply ‘the new terrorism’</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Logically, if there’s a new super-terrorism, then a new super-war-on-terrorism seems reasonable. </span><br />

<strong>In the face of imperialism we need to shatter the false pretenses of inevitability and failure- for these are only ideological justifications to maintain a network of bases that will only further neo- imperial agendas that target the racial body as an object to be militarized as eradicated- We must invade debate spaces in order to produce counter hegemonic narratives to delegitimize the strangle hold that imperialism has on our spaces of knowledge</strong> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Because of this fact, contemporary </span><strong><u>imperialism has had to drape itself in new ideological clothes; its defenders invade public debates speaking seemingly neutral languages of democracy</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and human </span><strong><u>rights</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">; of freedom and dignity; of </span><strong><u>inclusiveness</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and respect for difference; of gender </span><strong><u>equality</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and the alleviation of poverty; of good governance </span><strong><u>and sustainable development</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Alongside these decidedly modernist tropes, </span><u>others have appealed</u> to <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">the timeless verities of human nature or </span><u>culture t<strong>o justify the inevitability of war and empire</strong><strong>.</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Still others have touted the supposedly beneficent legacy of older imperialisms. Such juxtapositions are in keeping with “a deep and perplexing doubleness” of the new imperialism: a primal military atavism reminiscent of older forms of empire combined with the “spectacular” deployment of up-to-the-minute technologies of mass deception and distraction.4 Taken as a whole, the </span><u>new ideologies of empire express the same contradictory combination of</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> the retrogressive and the modern: of civilizational clashes and democratic ideals; of virulent </span><u>racism and postmodern multiculturalism</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">; of gender equality and religious oppression; </span><u>of old-fashioned propaganda and newfangled forms of “soft power</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">”; of torture and human rights. Against this backdrop, it </span><u>would be easy to lose sight of the difference between ideologies and lies<strong>.</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> However, ideologies are different from lies even if they are sometimes (as in the case of Iraq) bolstered by lies. For ideologies to work, they must speak to some genuine longing on the part of those who believe in them, however distorted these desires have become by the realities of exploitation and domination. Hence the talk of democracy and freedom. But<strong>,</strong> </span><strong><u>like lies, ideologies often involve a good deal of self-delusion</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> on the part of those who traffic in them – how else to explain the debacle of post-invasion Iraq? The systematic character of imperial self-delusion is perhaps best captured in U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld’s tortured explication of military ignorance: As we know, there are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns. That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also the unknown unknowns, the ones we don’t know we don’t know.5 As Slavoj Zizek observes, the one category that Rumsfeld failed to mention were the “unknown knowns”: </span><u>beliefs or practices</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – like the horrors of Abu Ghraib – </span><u>which must be quickly repressed since their knowledge is too much for consciousness to bear<strong>.</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Zizek contends </span><strong><u>t</u></strong><u>hat <strong>the real danger for the American empire lies</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">not in the threats which lie undiscovered, but “</span><strong><u>in the</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">disavowed</span><strong><u>beliefs</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, suppositions and obscene practices</span><strong><u>we pretend not to know about</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.”6 Be that as it may, </span><u>a good deal of conscious effort has been expended to justify and normalize the “new imperialism.” <strong>Policymakers mask their neo-imperial agendas under the guise of realist conceptions of threats and international chaos. These representational signifiers often reproduce coincidentally imperialist interventionism that wage military warfare against, black, brown, and oriental bodies, in the name of their own welfare.</strong> And <strong>although these threats are</strong> sometimes commonly known to be <strong>false</strong>, we subconsciously accept them as truth to enjoy the promise of security and stability. Even when these dangers are not calculable <strong>we sit back while the state</strong> panoptically monitors and voyeuristically <strong>travels the globe</strong> in hopes of <strong>finding new borders on which we can establishes bases which often represent the beginnings of new political and economic control.</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> It is a mark of the times in which we live that </span><u>the discourse of empire and imperialism</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – not so long ago considered an antique preoccupation of the Left – </span><u>has been embraced</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> by mainstream intellectuals from across the political spectrum. But, before examining these apologias in detail in the essays that follow, we need to ask: what has prompted this sudden desire to reclaim the language of empire? What changes in the global balance of forces can change this ideological shift? </span><u>We must reformulate international relations theory and hegemonic security philosophy by drafting a new discursive project aimed at historically analyzing the material conditions which have produced and sustained the U.S. as a global imperial entity. <strong>We must invade public debates and academic spaces where bodies of knowledge are normatively produced in ways that exclude marginal voices and counter-hegemonic narratives of U.S. colonialism. We must embrace antagonism as a legitimate political strategy armed with the possibility of producing genuine public policies aimed at resolving the residuals of colonial domination; for policies that fail to center the history of colonialism will ultimately be unsuccessful as the empire intensifies its imperial rule when it convinces the masses to forget.</strong> I understand fully that a complete re-intellectualization of international relations theory is a daunting task, but <strong>unless we commit to transitioning away from dominate realist/imperialist security logic, we wont be able to de-legitimate the normative foundations of imperialism that justify conquest and domination.</strong></u> <br />
<br />
<strong>The War on Terror is a narrative that frames security only in the context of paternalistic militarism - policies that do not recognize the mediums through which they are created only reinforce a perpetual victim-ology that makes cycles of destructive engagement inevitable- Our critical project is the first ethical step at deconstructing these dominant narratives and opening the possibilities of alternative modes of epistemology in international relations</strong> <br />

These ‘myths’ which have become normalized and banal in foreign policy, media, and some academic discourse I define as the ‘heroism’ discourse/myth and the ‘militarization’ discourse/myth.

First, </span><span class="Underline">this has resulted in real humanitarian and moral issues being overlooked; <strong>S</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">econd, </span><span class="Underline">images are being purged of their content</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span><span class="Underline"><strong>Myth</strong><strong>has</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> thus </span><span class="Underline"><strong>becoming the very real enemy of true humanitarianism</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">; that is, </span><span class="Underline"><strong>we’ve become so inundates with superhero mythologization of real world events that the embedded paternalism and unrealistic goals go unnoticed.</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">60 Additionally</span><span class="Underline">, <strong>this narrative reinforces a victimology of the ‘Other’</strong> and in fact capitalises on it, while simultaneously </span>hiding <strong>the paternalistic and neo-colonialist ideologies in humanitarian garb</strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. The role of the media and consciously generated and disseminated images is particularly pronounced here, as passion and spectacle are valued in the commodification of images over content and history. Jean Baudrillard states “There is no possible distinction, at the level of images and information, between the spectacular and the symbolic, no possible distinction between the ‘crime’ and the crackdown”.61 </span><span class="Underline"><strong>The militarization narrative</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, in contrast to the ‘objective benevolence’ of the heroism myth, </span><span class="Underline"><strong>utilizes constructed</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and one-dimensional </span><span class="Underline"><strong>conceptions of</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> militaries, security, and </span><span class="Underline"><strong>defense.</strong> This narrative relies on the myth that militarization is always a useful tool in securitization</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. For example: </span><span class="Underline"><strong>Following the NATO air strikes</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">in October of this year </span><span class="Underline"><strong>that killed</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> at least 50 </span><span class="Underline"><strong>civilians</strong> and an augmentation of Taliban suicide attacks, <strong>Afghanistan’s President</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Hamid Karzai </span><span class="Underline"><strong>called on the need for more military operations</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, an international air force, and an increase in Afghan soldiers and police </span><span class="Underline">as mechanisms necessary to “tackle the root causes of terrorism</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">”.62 </span><span class="Underline">Words such as ‘freedom’</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, ‘</span><span class="Underline">democracy’</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, ‘</span><span class="Underline">justice’</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, </span><span class="Underline">and</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">‘women’s ri</span><span class="Underline">ghts’ have become permanent variables in the mantra that has been used</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> liberally and </span><span class="Underline">repeatedly as part of the common</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and often un-stated, </span><span class="Underline">assumptionsthat intervention by</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> NATO, </span><span class="Underline">American</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, Canadian, and British </span><span class="Underline">forceswillimprove the lives of Afghanistan people over ‘there’ and increase security for us over ‘here’<strong>.</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Thus, </span><span class="Underline">as the military continues to occupy the region, we in the West are continually told that Afghan</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> women and </span><span class="Underline">men have now been “liberated” from an oppressive regime by the West.</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> This is bolstered by the assumption that the Afghan people support the US-backed government and want the military there for security (That is, that they are better off now than before). </span><span class="Underline"><strong>There is a dominant assumption that the West can “win” the “war on terror”</strong> and that military measures in the Middle East are necessary to prevent future terrorist attacks. If prospects look dim in the region, this narrative <strong>implies the appropriate response is to increase combat troops and artillery</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Finally, </span><span class="Underline">embedded in these images is the assumption that reconstruction</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, delivery of humanitarian aid and development </span><span class="Underline">can coesist alongside military efforts to fight off insurgents</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">/terrorists </span><span class="Underline">and“pacify” the opposition</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Thus, </span><span class="Underline">reports on the increasing numbers of casualties5 of the war does not appear incongruous with claims of ‘peace-making’ and ‘development</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">’ - therefore we must protect it the puppet government and fight the insurgents.<strong>63</strong> </span><span class="Underline"><strong>This type of narrative</strong><strong>serves</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">several purposes, including the </span><span class="Underline"><strong>reinforcement in the public of the legitimacy of military response</strong> to crises and the re-construction of power and dominance through the image of military superiority, fighting capacity, and mechanisms of control</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span>The result<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> of such myths </span><span class="Underline"><strong>is the</strong></span> <strong>reaffirmation of the importance of state-led military missions</strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> (which contribute to the maintenance of armed forces by attracting future recruits) </span><span class="Underline">and their necessity for resolving </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">multiple types of international </span><span class="Underline">crises</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Enloe defines militarization as a sociopolitical process by which militarism as an ideology is “driven deep down into the soil of a society”.64 </span><span class="Underline">Militarism</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, in turn, </span><span class="Underline">encompasses beliefs,</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> values, and assumptions </span><span class="Underline">including the use of armed force to resolve tensions</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, the effectiveness and naturalness of hierarchy, the need for a state to have a military in order to be perceived as legitimate, and that the feminine require armed protection while the masculine is only a “manly man” if he participates in the culture of armed conflict.65 </span><span class="Underline">The process of militarization involves </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">cultural, institutional, </span><span class="Underline">ideological</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, and economic </span><span class="Underline">transformations through which militaristic needs, </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">presumptions, and ideas gradually come to control or </span><span class="Underline">determine a person or thing.</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">66 In her work on the study of gender and militarization, Enloe has revealed how </span><span class="Underline">g</span>endered notions of masculinity and femininity are fundamental to the very establishment and maintenance of military structures<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">: “</span>None of these institutions<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – multilateral alliances, bilateral alliances, foreign military assistance programs – </span>can achieve their militarizing objectives without controlling women for the sake of militarizing men<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.”67 Additionally then, governmental policies and actions in the international arena (an arena deemed untouchable and irrelevant to women in orthodox studies of international relations) “</em>directly produce changes in women’s lives<em>”.(My [the author’s] italics)68 Enloe’s work is particularly relevant in this project which seeks to complicate, interrogate, and historicize particular mythic representations and narratives because it denaturalizes militarizing, war, and soldiering (so often presented as conventional and innate responses to conflict) and reveals them as deliberate actions of intentional policies and warmaking strategies (“Militarization and the privileging of masculinity are both products not only of amorphous cultural beliefs but also of deliberate decisions”)69. It also helps demonstrate that </span><span class="Underline"><strong>by ‘erasing’ history the structures that enabled it are legitimized and thus perpetuated;</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">that is, </span><span class="Underline"><strong>militarization, hegemonic masculinity, and the absence of women is represented as natural, normal and thus are potentially destructive mechanisms.</strong> </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">I think what is posed in Medea Benjamin’s interview is a rather simple and important question:</span> <u>Can U.S. imperialism and its troops play a positive role in some circumstances?</u> <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">The U.S. invades the remote and impoverished Afghanistan in 2001, topples the fragile regime of Taliban theocrats (which never consolidated countrywide power in the civil war).

Is this U.S. nuclear threat helpful, and that one unfair? Is this U.S. drone doing good work, and that one intruding dangerously?</span> <u>Is this U.S. occupation shielding and promoting positive forces — while that U.S. occupation cultivates more negative puppets? <strong>Do we support U.S. domination until someone better comes along (who </em><span style="color: #000000;">we</span><em> approve of) to take their place</strong>? Or does <strong>the U.S. military</strong> (globally and everywhere) <strong>represent a coherent means of</strong> imposing and <strong>enforcing a particular </em><span style="color: #000000;">global</span><em> order on humanity generally — an order that is rooted in horrific oppression and exploitation</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">(including the widespread commodification of women as both workers and sexual slaves, </em><span style="color: #000000;">and</span><em> the traditional domestic servitude of literally </em><span style="color: #000000;">billions</span><em> of women and girls)?</span><u><span style="color: #000000;">What we need is a clear uncompromising unapologetic position: </span><strong>We must demand that U.S. imperialism leave Afghanistan immediately and unconditionally — without finding ways to prop up residual collaborators</strong>and puppet forces, <strong>without continuing to “provide air cover” for continuing war crimes</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>The Afghanistan people need to be left to resolve their political affairs (</strong>and develop their own very difficult struggle for liberation<strong>) without U.S. domination and violence</strong></u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">.And because this is apparently quite controversial (even on the left): We should deepen our own understanding that</span> <u>these armed forces cannot and will not help the people in any part of the world.

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">In ‘Collective Responsibility’ (1968) Arendt explained the distinction between collective guilt and collective responsibility: ‘Guilt, unlike responsibility, always singles out; it is strictly personal. It refers to an act, not to intentions or potentialities.’96 The notion of collective guilt is problematic for two reasons: first, because it imputes blame irrespective of the actions (or inactions) of the individual members of a group; guilt for wrongs, in other words, can arise only from the particular actions of individuals; second, because it eliminates the necessity of judging particular acts, policies, and institutions that produce identifiable harms. For Arendt, the abstract generality of the notion of collective guilt reinforces thoughtlessness and an unwillingness to judge, and therefore is manifestly unpolitical. </span><strong><u>Collective responsibility</u></strong><u>,</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> to the contrary</span><strong><u>, is</u></strong><strong><u>always political insofar as it emphasises the social embeddedness of individual</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">s. To make sense of the notion of collective responsibility, Arendt points out that </span><u>‘I must be held responsible for something I have not done, and the reason for my responsibility must be my membership in a group</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> (a collective), </span><u>which novoluntary act of mine can dissolve.</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">’97 Collective or political responsibility is, Arendt insists, im</span><u>putable on the basis of association; since individuals are always already members of a human community, they are responsible for its collective actions</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Collective responsibility is ‘vicarious’ in that we are liable for ‘things we have not done’, that is, </span><strong><u>we are liable for those things that are done in our name by institutional structures whose outcomes are the result of collective action</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. This ‘taking upon ourselves the consequences’ for things we have not done individually is, Arendt insists, ‘the </span><u>price we pay for the fact that we live our lives not by ourselves but among our fellow men’</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.98 Arendt’s account of collective responsibility underscores the ways that personal and political responsibility link up because individuals share a world in common with others, and brings together her observations on political evil in The Origins of Totalitarianism and Eichmann in Jerusalem. The Origins of Totalitarianism approached the problem of political evil primarily fromthe perspective of the pathology of modern institutional structures – from governments, to international organisations, to the capitalist system of production – which have progressively globalised policies and modes of action that have resulted in large-scale human superfluity. Yet Arendt observed as well that </span><strong><u>the ideology and bureaucracy of modern politico-economic structures degraded the ability of individuals to think and judge, not only about the rightness or wrongness of systemic elements themselves but also about their individual adherence to the rules and norms of these structures</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Hence Arendt’s notion of the banality of evil was meant to convey the ways that individuals relieve themselves both of the personal responsibility to think and judge and the political responsibility to recognise that collective wrongs can be actualised only through our continuing to perform the institutionalised functions that lead to such outcomes. ‘</span><strong><u>Normal’ individuals thus can be responsible for the political evil resulting from the social structures</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> to which we belong, even though they may not ‘personally’ intend such outcomes. By failing to assume personal and political responsibility for their substantial contributions to severe poverty, both the citizens and the governments of the affluent countries (predominantly those whose comparative advantage derives from the imperial legacy) enter into complicity with the political evil of human superfluousness. Arendt’s diagnosis of the ways in which superfluous human beings are produced led her to the conclusion that such political evil could not be confined solely to Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism, but that it has become an ‘international modern phenomenon’.99 Similarly, Kevin Bales contends that with economic globalisation comes the ‘globalisation of complicity’: </span><u>‘<strong>Today the individual’s complicity in perceived evil may be connected to trans-national perpetrators’ no longer restricted to the nation-state.</strong></u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">100 While most of us do not design the policies and institutions that entrench radical inequality ever deeper into the ‘wasted lives’ of the global poor, </span><strong><u>our continuing acquiescence to the status quo ‘without much thought about the origins of our affluence’ nevertheless provides the banal foundation for massive misery</u></strong> <u>and deprivation</u><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.<strong>101</strong> </span><strong><u>If we are to begin to counteract this widespread political irresponsibility we must find the courage to think about and judge our actions and those of the institutional arrangements to which we belong, from the local to the global; to draw connections between our individual choices and actions and their necessarily political impact upon the world</u></strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">; and to condemn those modes of politico-economic 97. organisation which radically degrade others and deprive them of a place in the ‘world common to all people’.102</span><br />

<u>A second feature of this discourse of danger is the <strong>hyperbolic language of threat</strong></u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. </span><u>It is not just a threat of sudden violent death, it is actually a ‘threat to civilization’, a ‘threat to the very essence of what you do’,</u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn42" rel="nofollow">__[42]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> a ‘</span><u>threat to our way of life’</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">,</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn43" rel="nofollow">__[43]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> and a threat to ‘the peace of the world’.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn44" rel="nofollow">__[44]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> The notion of a ‘threat to our way of life’ is a Cold War expression that vastly inflates the danger</span><u>: <strong>instead of a tiny group of dissidents with resources that do not even begin to rival that of the smallest states, it implies that they are as powerful as the Soviet empire</strong> was once thought to be with its tens of thousands of missiles and its massive conventional army.</u> <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">Moreover, as Cheney reminds us, the threat of terrorism, like the threat of Soviet nuclear weapons, is supremely catastrophic: The attack on our country forced us to come to grips with the possibility that the next time terrorists strike, they may well be armed with more than just plane tickets and box cutters. The next time they might direct chemical agents or diseases at our population, or attempt to detonate a nuclear weapon in one of our cities. […] </span><em><u>no rational person</u></em> <u>can doubt that terrorists would use such weapons of mass murder the moment they are able to do so.</u> <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">[…] we are dealing with terrorists […] who are willing to sacrifice their own lives in order to kill millions of others.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn45" rel="nofollow">__[45]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">In other words, not only are we threatened by evil terrorists eager to kill millions (not to mention civilization itself, the peace of the world, and the American way of life), but this is a rational and reasonable fear to have. We should be afraid, very afraid: ‘If they had the capability to kill millions of</span> <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">innocent civilians, do any of us believe they would hesitate to do so?’.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn46" rel="nofollow">__[46]__</a><u>As if this was not enough <strong>to spread panic</strong> throughout the community, officials then <strong>go to great lengths to explain</strong> how these same <strong>terrorists (who are eager to kill millions of us) are actually highly sophisticated</strong>,</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> cunning, and extremely dangerous. As John Ashcroft put it: ‘The highly coordinated attacks of September 11 make it clear that terrorism is the activity of expertly organized, highly coordinated and wellfinanced organizations and networks’.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn47" rel="nofollow">__[47]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> Moreover, </span><u>this is not a tiny and isolated group of dissidents, but ‘there are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries’ and they ‘hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction’</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">;</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn48" rel="nofollow">__[48]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> or, like </span><u>the plot of a popular novel</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">: ‘Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs, set to go off without warning’.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn49" rel="nofollow">__[49]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> In other speeches, </span><strong><u>officials inflate the numbers of the terrorists to ‘tens of thousands’ of killers spread throughout the world.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">The next layer of fear is the notion that the threat resides within; that it is no longer confined outside the borders of the community, but that it is inside of us and all around us. As Ashcroft constructs it: The attacks of September 11 were acts of terrorism against America orchestrated and carried out by individuals living within our borders. Today's terrorists enjoy the benefits of our free society even as they commit themselves to our destruction. They live in our communities—plotting, planning and waiting to kill Americans again […] a conspiracy of evil.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn50" rel="nofollow">__[50]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> Like the ‘red scares’ of the past, </span><strong><u>the discourse of danger</u></strong> <u>is <strong>deployed</strong> in this mode to enforce social discipline, mute dissent, and <strong>increase the powers of the national security state</strong>.</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> It is designed to bring the war home, or, as Bush puts it: ‘And make no mistake about it, we’ve got a war here just like we’ve got a war abroad’.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn51" rel="nofollow">__[51]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> In another genealogical link to previous American foreign policy, </span><u>the threat of terrorism is from a very early stage reflexively conflated with the threat of ‘weapons of mass destruction’ and the ‘rogue states’ who might hand them on to terrorists</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. According to the discourse, </span><strong><u>rogue states are apparently eager to assist terrorists in killing millions of Americans</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. As Bush stated in his now infamous ‘axis of evil’ speech, </span><u>States</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> like these, and </span><u>their terrorist allies</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. Thcaey could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn52" rel="nofollow">__[52]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> This is actually </span><u>an ingenious discursive slight of hand</u> <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">which </span><strong><u>allows America to re-target its military from a war against a tiny group of individual dissidents scattered across the globe</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> (surely an unwinnable war), </span><strong><u>to</u></strong> <u>territorially defined <strong>states who also happen to be the target of American foreign policy</strong>.</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> It transforms the ‘war against terrorism’ from a largely hidden and unspectacular intelligence gathering and criminal apprehension program, to a flag-waving public display of awesome military firepower that re-builds a rather dented American self-confidence. Dick Cheney explained it to his colleagues thus: ‘To the extent we define our task broadly, including those who support terrorism, then we get at states. And it’s easier to find them that it is to find bin Laden.’</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn53" rel="nofollow">__[53]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> Perhaps more importantly, it also allows for the simultaneous pursuit of geo-strategic objectives in crucial regions such as the Middle East under the banner of the ‘war on terrorism’.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn54" rel="nofollow">__[54]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> Instead of reassuring the nation that the attacks were an exceptional and a unique event in a long line of terrorist attacks against America (that have thus far failed to overthrow freedom), the Bush administration chose instead </span><u>to construct them as the start of a whole new age of terror—the start of a deadly new form of violence directed at Americans</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">, civilized people all over the world, freedom and democracy. The Bush administration could have chosen to publicize the conclusions of the Gilmore Commission in 1999, a Clinton-appointed advisory panel on the threat of WMD falling into the hands of terrorists. Its final report concluded that ‘rogue states would hesitate to entrust such weapons to terrorists because of the likelihood that such a group’s actions might be unpredictable even to the point of using the weapon against its sponsor’, and they would be reluctant to use such weapons themselves due to ‘the prospect of significant reprisals’.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn55" rel="nofollow">__[55]__</a><strong><u>Condoleeza Rice herself wrote</u></strong> <u>in 2000 that there <strong>was no need to panic about rogue states,</strong> because ‘if they do acquire WMD—their weapons will be unusable because any attempt to use them will bring national obliteration</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">’.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm#_edn56" rel="nofollow">__[56]__</a><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> Instead, </span><strong><u>officials engaged in the deliberate construction of a world of unimaginable dangers</u></strong> <u>and unspeakable threats; they encouraged social fear and moral panic</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. Within the suffocating confines of such an emergency, where Americans measure their daily safety by the color of a national terrorist alert scale (reflected in the glow of every traffic light), it seems perfectly reasonable that the entire resources of the state be mobilized in defense of the homeland, and that pre-emptive war should be pursued. It also seems reasonable that national unity be maintained and expressions of dissent curtailed. The reality effect of scripting such a powerful danger moreover, can be seen in the two major wars fought in two years (followed by costly ongoing ‘security operations’ in each of those states to root out the terrorists), </span><strong><u>the arrest of thousands of suspects in America and around the world, and the vast sums spent unquestioningly</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">(even by the Democrats) </span><strong><u>on domestic security, border control and the expansion of the military</u></strong><u>.</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> Only the ‘reality’ of the threat of terrorism allows such extravagance; in fact, the manner in which the threat has been constructed -catastrophic, ubiquitous and ongoing- normalizes the entire effort. </span><strong><u>If an alternative interpretation of the threat emerged to challenge the dominant orthodoxy</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">(that it was vastly over-blown, or misdirected, for example), </span><strong><u>support for the consumption of such massive amounts of resources might be questioned and the political order destabilized</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. A massive threat of terrorism then, is necessary for the continued viability of the ‘war on terrorism’; writing the threat of terrorism is co-constitutive of the practice of counter-terrorism. </span><br />
