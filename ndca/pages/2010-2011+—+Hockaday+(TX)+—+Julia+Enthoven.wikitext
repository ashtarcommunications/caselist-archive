<span style="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Because we derive morality from our rationality, moral laws must be universalizable. Immanuel Kant. //The Groundwork of the Meta Physics of Morals.// (1785) p. 92. </span>[[http://www.books.google.com/|www.books.google.com]]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> “For all rational… himself also gives.” </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The only universal maxim is that of respecting dignity.

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Contention: possession of nuclear weapons cannot be universally prohibited since a maxim cannot be created on possession, so it is moral.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Subpoint A: The possession of a tool cannot entail an action or a violation.
