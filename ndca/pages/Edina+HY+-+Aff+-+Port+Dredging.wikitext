1ac—Sealift


Sealift capabilities aren’t adequate – can’t handle multiple points of engagement
Baumgardner 02 Senior Military Analyst at Dynamis from Georgetown University (Neil, “Army Wargame Participants See Need For More Lift Capabilities”, Defense Daily. Potomac: Apr 26, 2002. Vol. 214, Iss. 20; pg. 1, http://proquest.umi.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/pqdweb?did=116124581&Fmt=3&clientId=17822&RQT=309&VName=PQD) RaPa

CARLISLE BARRACKS, Pa.--Fast sealift … … sad day for red forces everywhere."


The plan is critical to sealift capabilities – two internal links


First is size limitations and efficiency

Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (1975) (Lawrence Juda and Richard Burroughs, “Dredging Navigational Channels in a Changing Scientific and Regulatory Environment” 34 Journal of Maritime Law & Commerce 174-179)

But port facilities and maritime transportation are … … where they have not existed before.


That’s key to military readiness

Most national security experts predict … …as requested in the President’s Budget



Second is container immobilization

Lack of attention to port maintenance and improvement … … military or significant commercial cargo.


That’s the critical internal link into sealift effectiveness

Vital national efforts such as military cargo … … than those associated with Operation Desert Storm in 1991.

Sealift is also is the foundation of USPACOM effectiveness

The USPACOM Area of Responsibility (AOR) … … substantial U.S. forces in the region.


And, root causes of war are non-falsifiable – deterrence solves enough anyways
Moore 4 Walter L. Brown Professor of Law at the University of Virginia School of Law (John Norton Moore, “Solving the War Puzzle: beyond the democratic peace,” pg 41-43)
If major interstate war is predominantly a product … … making the gamble not worth the risk.
