**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">These aesthetic sensibilities ride everything--Our conception of what is aesthetically “good” or “bad” ORGANIZES and DOMINATES all other spheres of thought and inquiry—from education to politics to philosophy to morality.

I am married to Heidi and have two children, Louis and Alexander. In the mid 1980's in initiated the O.U.R.S. Project, a cultural and astronautical organization dedicated to introducing, nurturing and expanding a cultural dimension to humanity's astronautical endeavors. In addition to being a vehicle for the development of my space art projects, the O.U.R.S. Project organized the first European Space Art Workshop held in Montreux, Switzerland in 1992 and was co-organizer, along with Leonardo/OLATS and the International Academy of A stronautics (IAA) of the 9 space art workshops (1997-2005) held first in Paris and then later in other venues. In cooperation with Leonardo/OLATS/IAA and with the sponsorship of ESA, we developed the “Spacearts: The Space Art Database” project which has been online since 2003. The O.U.R.S. Project also organized or co-organized international exhibitions of space art held at the International Astronautical Congresses (IAC) in Oslo, 1995, Turin, 1997 and Melbourne in 1998. I served as co-chair of the IAA sub-committee on the arts and literature and from 1996 – 2003, I was involved in the planning of the IAA sessions related to the arts and humanities held at the annual IAC congresses. I have co-organized several ESA and IAA studies including the design and maintenance of the related websites: ESA study – “ITSF: Innovative Technologies in Science Fiction for Space Applications”: which has also conducted two international competitions for Science Fiction short stories. IAA study - “The Impact of Space Activities on Society”: where world leaders were invited to comment on the importance of space activities. IAA study - “Space Expectations: How the Public Views Space Activities”: a multilingual survey in 7 languages of the public’s expectations about space.

He spent his youth living near the Kennedy space center in Florida where he witnessed the beginning of the American space program and where he later worked during the Apollo program. In 1970 he graduated from Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, USA with studies in psychology, literature and art. After beginning his career as an artist in California, he settled in Switzerland in 1974. In the mid-eighties he was one of several artists around the world who proposed to create art works in the environment of outer space. His Orbiting Unification Ring Satellite (OURS) project to put "a circle in the sky" to celebrate the new millennium with a large orbital sculpture led to the manufacture of a prototype inflatable space sculpture (OUR-SPS) built in 1990 by NPO Energia in the Soviet Union and later to the realization of two art-in-space projects flown on the Mir space station: the spaceflight of his Cosmic Dancer Sculpture in 1993 and "Ars Ad Astra: the 1st Art Exhibition in Earth Orbit" in cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) on its EuroMir95 mission. He is currently a co-developer of the online research project: ITSF - Innovative Technologies in Science Fiction for Space Applications initiated by ESA. He is founder and president the OURS Foundation - a non-profit cultural and astronautical organization and is founder and CEO of Swissart GmbH an Internet company that develops and maintains "swissart.net" - Switzerland's art portal for the contemporary arts.
