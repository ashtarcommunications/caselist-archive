<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Mr. Sabur, who is 26 years old and from Bangladesh, started working at the <strong>U.S. military base Camp Arifjan</strong> in Kuwait in January 2008. He had to pass through three security check points manned by Kuwaiti police before he could enter the base. Along with 300 other guest workers, his job was to clean the base. The workers cleaned tanks, rocket launchers and missiles as well as office and living spaces, including the bathrooms. <strong><em>He worked the night shift from 6:30 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. the following morning seven days a week. Given the 11-hour shift, seven days a week, Mr. Sabur was putting in a 77-hour work week.</em></strong> He was allowed a one hour break at midnight to eat his supper.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">For the 70 hours of work, he was paid just <strong><em>$34.72</em></strong> a week, or <strong><em>50 cents an hour, which is 45 percent short</em></strong> of the 90-cent-an-hour wage he was guaranteed when he purchased his contract to work in Kuwait. Even without including overtime premium or night shift differential, he should have earned at least $63 for the 70 hour work week, and not the $34.72 he was paid. <strong><em>Mr. Sabur was cheated of $28.28 each week in wages due him, and $857.17 for the seven months of 2008 that he worked on the U.S. military base.</em></strong> This is an enormous amount of money for these poor workers. Mr. Sabur said that the U.S. troops themselves were always very kind and decent to him.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Mr. Sabur began working in Kuwait on May 19, 2006 for the <strong><em>Kuwait Waste Collection and Recycling Company</em></strong>, which has 2,000 guest worker employees. <strong><em>His passport was immediately confiscated by company management.</em></strong> Mr. Sabur had to pay 185,000 taka—$2,696.79—to an employment recruiting agency in Bangladesh to purchase his three-year contract to work in Kuwait. His family sold everything they could—land, animals, tools, jewelry—so their son would have the money to go to Kuwait. They were still 30,000 taka ($437.23) short, which they had to borrow from a neighbor. In the Bangladeshi countryside, the interest rate to borrow money in the informal market is at least <strong><em>eight percent a month</em></strong>. Essentially, the initial $437.23 loan doubles each year if it is not paid off. This is why the hundreds of thousands of guest workers in Kuwait are in a trap, racing against time to pay off their debts.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Because he was being cheated of his lawful wages at the Arifjan U.S. military base, Mr. Sabur was forced to take a second job with the <strong>Ummal Hammal</strong> company, cleaning schools nine hours a day, at least six days a week. Mr. Sabur worked from 5:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at the school and only had time to quickly eat lunch and sleep for just three hours before starting his 6:30 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. shift at the U.S. military base. <strong><em>Mr. Sabul was working 131 hours a week and trying to get by on just three hours of sleep a day!</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Mr. Sabur and his colleagues were housed in a dilapidated six-story building in the Mahboula area where eight workers were crowded into small 10-by-10-foot room, sleeping on double-level bunk beds.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">To prepare their food, 24 workers shared a single gas range with three burners. The water supply to the dorm was irregular and limited. On some days, the workers were allowed less than a gallon of water each—to drink, bathe and cook with.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Before joining the U.S. military base in January 2008, Mr. Sabur worked cleaning roads and buildings for the Kuwaiti government under contract with the same Kuwaiti Waste Collection and Recycling company. While cleaning Kuwaiti government property, he was paid just <strong><em>28 cents an hour and $13.37 a week, which is 70 percent short of the 90 cents an hour and $43.40 a week he was supposed to earn when he signed his contract.</em></strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">The Kuwaiti Waste Collection and Recycling Company also <strong><em>illegally withheld his first three months wages.</em></strong> During his first three months in Kuwait—despite working cleaning government property—he had to borrow money from his fellow workers just to survive.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Near the end of 2007, Mr. Sabur asked his supervisor, Mr. Osman, to please pay the proper wages according to his contract. <strong><em>The supervisor responded by beating him.</em></strong> All across Kuwait, guest workers are frightened of being beaten and deported if they ask for their basic rights. Like Mr. Sabur, workers have little choice but to keep quiet. &quot;Workers don't usually open their mouths,&quot; Mr. Sabur explained. </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 5.75pt;"><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">E.L.: Solitude was an &quot;existentialist&quot; theme. At the time existence was described as the despair of solitude, or as the isolation within anxiety. The book represents an attempt to escape from this isolation of existing, as the preceding book signified an attempt to escape from the &quot;there is.&quot; There also, there are two stages. First I examine an &quot;exit&quot; toward the world, in knowledge. My effort consists in showing that</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">knowledge is</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> in reality <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">an immanence</span>, and that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">there is no rupture of</span> the isolation of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">being</span> in knowl- edge; and on the other hand, that in </span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">the</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> communication </span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">of knowledge</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> one is found beside the Other</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">, not confronted with him, not in the rectitude of the in-front-of him. But being in direct relation with the Other is not to thematize the Other and consider him in the same manner one considers a known object, nor to communicate a knowledge to him. In reality,</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">the fact of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">being is what is most private; existence</span> is the sole thing <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">I cannot communicate</span>; I can tell about it, but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">I cannot share my existence</span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. Solitude thus appears here as the isolation which marks the very event of being. The social is beyond ontology. Ph.N.: You write: &quot;It is banal to say we never exist in the singular. Weare surrounded by beings and things with which we maintain relations. Through sight, touch, sympathy and common work we are with others. All these relations are transitive.</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">I touch an object, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">I see the other; but I am not the other.</span></span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">&quot;</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;"> E.L.: What is formulated here is the putting into question of this with, as possibility of escaping solitude. Does &quot;existing with&quot; represent a veritable sharing of existence? How is this sharing realized? Or again (for the word &quot;sharing&quot; would signify that existence is of the order of having): Is there a participation in being which makes us escape from solitude? Ph.N.:</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">One can only share what one has, one cannot share what one is</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">? E.L.: For that matter, the fundamental rela- tion with being, in Heidegger, is not the relationship with the Other, but with death, where everything that is non-authentic in the relationship with the Other is denounced, since one dies alone. Ph.N.:</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> You follow: &quot;I am all alone, it is thus the being in me, the fact that I exist, my existing, which constitutes the absolutely intransitive element, something without intentionality, without relation. One can exchange everything between beings, except existing</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. In this sense, to be is to be isolated by existing. I am monad inasmuch as I am. It is by existing that I am without doors or windows, and not through any content in me which would be incom- municable. If it is incommunicable it is that it is rooted in my being, which is what is most private in me. In this way, every enlargement of my conscious- ness, of my means of expression, remains without effect on my relation with existing, the interior rela- tion par excellence.&quot; E.L.: One must indeed understand nonethe- less that solitude is not in itself the primary theme of these reflections. It is only one of the marks of being. It is not a matter of escaping from solitude, but rather of escaping from being Ph.N.: Thus, the first solution is the escaping from the self which constitutes the relation to the world in knowledge and in what you call &quot;nourishments.&quot; E.L.: By that I understand all terrestrial-nourish- ments: the enjoyments through which the subject eludes his solitude. The very expression &quot;to elude one's solitude&quot; indicates the illusory and purely apparent character of this escape from the self. In what concerns knowledge: it is by essence a relation with what one equals and includes, with that whose alterity one suspends, with what becomes immanent, because it is to my measure and to my scale. I think of Descartes, who said that</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">the cogito can give itself the sun and sky; the only thing it cannot give itself is the idea of the Infinite</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. Knowledge is always an adequation between thought and what it thinks. There is in knowledge, in the final account, an impossibility of escaping the self;</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">hence <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">sociality cannot have the same structure as knowledge</span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. Ph.N.: There is here something paradoxical. F or the ordinary consciousness, to the con trary, knowledge is almost by definition what makes us escape ourselves. Even though you maintain that</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">in knowledge, even of</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> the stars, of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">what is farthest, we remain within the</span> element of the &quot;<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">same</span>&quot;? E.L.: Knowledge has always been interpreted as assimilation. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Even the most surprising discoveries end by being absorbed,</span> comprehended, with all that there is of &quot;prehending&quot; in &quot;comprehending.&quot; The most audacious and remote knowledge does not put us in communion with the truly other; it does not take the place of sociality; it is still and always a solitude</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. Ph.N.: You speak in this regard of knowledge as a light; what is illuminated is thus possessed. E.L.: Or possessable. Up to the remotest stars. Ph.N.: By distinction, the escape from solitude is going to be a dispossession or a detachment? E.L.:</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">Sociality will be a way of escaping being</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> otherwise than through knowledge</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">.</span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">In this book the demonstration is not dealt with in its entirety, but it is time which appeared to me then as an enlargement of existence. The book shows first some structures in the relationship with the Other which do not reduce to intentionality. It puts in doubt the Husserlian idea that intentionality represents the very spirituality of spirit. And the book tries to understand the role of time in this relationship: time is not a simple experi- ence of duration, but a dynamism which leads us elsewhere than toward the things we possess. It is as if in time there were a movement beyond what is equal to us. Time as relationship to unattainable alterity and, thus, interruption of rhythm and its returns. The two principal analyses which support this thesis in Time and the Other concern, on the one hand, the erotic relationship, relationship - without confusion - with the alterity of the feminine; and, on the other hand, the relationship of paternity going from me to another who, in a certain sense, is still me and nevertheless is absolutely other: temporality brought near to the concreteness and logical paradox of fecundity. These are</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">relationships with alterity</span> </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">which</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">contrast</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> strongly <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">with those whereby the Same dominates</span> or absorbs or includes <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the other</span>, and whose model is knowledge. </span></span></span><br />

<span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">Heidegger's question</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> seems the most philo- sophical of questions: &quot;<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">What is . .</span> .?&quot; What is thinking? What is poetry? What is technology</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">?</span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">And now, what is ethics? If in this question we can uncover an onto-theo-Iogical bent, then we are on the way to grasping its inappropriateness with regard to ethics, if indeed ethics survives the end of metaphysics. Perhaps, by doing this, the mystery and strangeness which surrounds the later writings of Heidegger, the peculiar meanderings of his path out of metaphysics can be grasped in an entirely new way</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">.</span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">Is</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> the very question of essence, the &quot;What is. . .?&quot; question, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">itself</span> too <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">metaphysically compromised</span>?</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">The mind rebels. What could be more essential to any sort of intelligent inquiry, to any sort of think- ing, than to ask what something is, to seek its essence, to know it as it is, in its manifestation?</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">What is more unavoidable than asking what ethics is</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">to discover if ethics is onto-theo-Iogical and hence metaphysical in the corrupting sense? Since Socrates thought has been intimately tied to the cautions which inhere in the question of es- sence. We insist on asking and knowing what some- thing is before committing ourselves to action or belief. Indeed, such caution has become our very action, our reserve and wariness. Knowledge of the essence, essential knowledge, precedes the existen- tial: Socrates thought before he acted, he pauses before the symposium, to contemplate, to delib~rate, to ask what's what. &quot;</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">To know the good,&quot; he taught, &quot;is to do the good&quot;; so tied were thinking and human being.</span> </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">Socrates defeated the &quot;ignorance&quot; of opponent after opponent with his questioning. His interlocu- tors learned that they must first know the good in order to then do it, that they must be philosophers, lovers of wisdom before all else. But Nietzsche and Heidegger have made Soc- rates suspect too. Their suspicions, the inversions they point to, are not, however, what I wish to pursue for the moment. Rather, it is the essentialist form these suspicions still take that is of greater import.</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">We must ask what is the &quot;What is . . .?&quot; question</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. In Socrates' hands it led to the inversion of conscious- ness and instincts, the sacrifice of the latter to the former. But what of this question in Heidegger's hands? Are we not in need of still more precautions?</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">Must we</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> not step back from this question to raise another, to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">recognize the obvious circularity of ask- ing what is the &quot;What is . . .?&quot;</span> question? It seems to beg the question. Is our new suspicion, then, that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Heidegger begs the question of metaphysics when he asks &quot;What is poetry?&quot; or &quot;What is thinking</span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">?&quot;? Yet his thought is insistently anti-metaphysical. Why, then, does he retain the metaphysical question par excellence? Aware of just such an objection, he pro- poses, against the vicious circle of the petitio principi, an alternative, productive circularity: hermeneutic questioning. To ask &quot;What is . . .?&quot; does not partake of onto-theo-Iogy if one acknowledges (1) that the answer can never be fixed absolutely, but calls essen- tially, endlessly, for additional &quot;What is . . .?&quot; ques- tions. Dialectical refinement here replaces vicious circularity. Further, beyond the openmindedness called for by dialectical refinement, hermeneutic questioning (2) insists on avoiding subjective impositions, on avoid- ing reading into rather than harkening to things. One must harken to the things themselves, ultimately to being, in a careful attunement to what is. But do the refinement and care of the herme- neutic question - which succeed in avoiding onto- theo-Iogy - succeed in avoiding all viciousness? Certainly they convert a simple fallacy into a produc- tive inquiry, they open a path for thought. But is it not the case that</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">however much refinement and care one brings to bear, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to ask what something is leads to asking what something else is, and so on and so forth, ad infinitum</span></span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">?</span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">What is disturbing in this is not so much the infinity of interpretive depth, which has the virtue of escaping onto-theo-Iogy and remaining true to the way things are, to the phenomena, the coming to be and passing away of being. Rather</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">, the problem lies in the influence the endlessly open horizon of such thinking exerts on the way of such thought</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. That is,</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">the problem lies in</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">what seems to be the very virtue of hermeneutic thought, namely,</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">the doggedness of the &quot;What is .</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> . .?&quot; question, in <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">its inability to escape</span> itself, to escape <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">being</span> and essence.</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">But what could be more inescapable than being and essence? Isn't such a &quot;probkm&quot; mere silliness, or return to onto-theo-Iogy, the craving for a beyond? In what way is the doggedness of essential question- ing a constraint, a viciousness? In what way is an attuned predisposition toward being and essence - what else could there be? - a flaw?</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">The</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">only</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">way such questioning can be recognized as problematic is</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> by introducing <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">another sort of questioning, a questioning structured entirely other- wise</span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">, while at the same time structured in a way which is not itself onto-theo-Iogical.</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">Such is the ethi- cal question</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">. Rather than asking what ethics is, in the hope of finding out whether ethics is onto-theo- logical or not, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">one can ask if ethics is better than being</span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. This sort of question is not an essential question. It does not - no matter how respectfully - call for more vision. The ethical question does not merely contrast with the question of essence, as if onto- logical and ethical questions operated on the same horizon, under the same light; they are not on the same plane. More-over, the question of essence - &quot;What is ethics?&quot; - positively and precisely excludes the force of the ethical question. It collapses the &quot;what ought to be&quot; of ethics into the &quot;what is&quot; of ontology. I almost said it obscures the ethical question, but the point is that the very standards of obscurity and clarity are already standards of being and es- sence.</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">The approach of the ethical</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> question, to the contrary, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is</span> and must be immediately one of moral height, of obligation and responsibility not for what is, but for <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">what ought to be. Ethics</span> is not merely different from thinking, in which case it would even- tually be absorbed by thinking's play of differences, it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">cuts across ontology, it is</span> radically and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">irreducibly </span></span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">&quot;otherwise than being</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> or beyond essence</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">.&quot; The result of the above excursus into the influ- ence of language on questioning seems to be the emergence of two questions rather than one. With the end of onto-theo-Iogical metaphysics, (1) is ethics still better? Does the term &quot;better&quot; still carry moral force, divorced from reality claims, from God, sub- stance, transcendental ego, etc.? Or, there remains what appears to be the most philosophical of ques- tions, (2) what is ethics really, if it is anything at all, with the end of onto-theo-Iogical metaphysics? De- pending on which sort of question one asks first, an ethical or an ontological results follows. It seems, then, that the viciousness of question begging has merely been doubled rather than vitiated. Ethical questions yield ethical answers (perhaps). Essential questions yield essential answers. It is important to see that this is not so, or that if it is so then the &quot;fault&quot; lies with essential question- ing. </span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">To be, according to Levinas, is not enough, even if such being takes responsibility for the unfolding of being, for the ongoing revelation of worlds. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">There is a trap in essential questioning, an ad infinitum neglectful of its own</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;"> condition. Ethics</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">, in Levinas' view,</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">occurs &quot;prior&quot; to essence and being</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">, conditioning them</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. Not, however, because the good is installed in a Heaven above or an identity behind identities, for this would just take the ontological move one step back, would again fall back into onto-theo-Iogy, once more confusing ethics with ontology, as if what &quot;ought to be&quot; somehow &quot;,is.&quot;</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">What ethics is does not survive the end of metaphysics - but only because ethics never was or is anything. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Ethics does not have an essence</span>, its &quot;essence,&quot; so to speak, is precisely not to have an essence, to unsettle essences. Its &quot;identity&quot; is precisely not to have an identity, to undo identities</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">.</span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">Its &quot;being&quot; is not to be but to be better than being. Ethics is precisely ethics by disturbing the complacency of being</span></strong> </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">(or of non-being, being's correlate).</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><strong><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> &quot;<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">To be or not to be,&quot; Levinas insists, is not the question</span></span></strong></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. Ethics occurs as an anarchy, the compassion of being. Its priority is affirmed without recourse to principles, without vision,</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">in the irrecuperable shock of being-for-the-other-person before being-for- oneself</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">, or being-with-others, or being-in-the-world, to name some of the contemporary philosophical formulas of post-metaphysical thought. </span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">Ethical priority</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">, according to Levinas, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">occurs as the moral height of the other person over being</span>, essence, iden- tity, manifestation, principles, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">i</span>n brief, over me. </span><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">There is more to being than being</span></strong></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. The surplus of the other's nonencompassable alterity - not the alterity of horizons - is the way ethics intrudes, disturbs, commands being - from height and desti- tution. It is the demand made by the very face of the Other in a nakedness which pierces the face which can be objectified. &quot;The face,&quot; Levinas says in the pages which follow, &quot;is what one cannot kill, or it is that whose meaning consists in saying: 'thou shalt not kill.</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">'</span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">Murder</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">, it is true, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is a banal fact; one can kill the Other; the ethical exigency is not an ontological necessity. The prohibition</span> against killing <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">does not render murder impossible.&quot; It renders it evil.</span></span> <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">One can kill, but it is better not to</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> kill</span></strong></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">, howevermuch this &quot;better&quot; escapes thematization, representation, formalization, idealization, identification, and all the cautions of essential thinking.</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">To know the good is already not to have done it. One does the good before knowing it - ethics lies in this &quot;before,&quot; eternally scandalous to thought. Neither my consciousness nor my instincts are sufficient to the excessive demand the other places on me</span></strong></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">.</span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">They are cut to the quick. Yet shattered - as shattered, a fission, a &quot;despite-myself,&quot; for &quot;no one is good voluntarily,&quot; says Levinas - the subject rises to the occasion, subjected to the most passive passiv- ity, saying &quot;Here I am.&quot; The crux of ethics lies in the non- encompassable yet non-indifferent relation be- tween the &quot;better&quot; and &quot;being.&quot; It is a relation like no other, &quot;a distance which is also proximity,&quot; Levi- nas wrote in 1946, &quot;- which is not a coincidence or a lost union, but signifies all the surplus or all the goodness of an original sociality.&quot; Responsibility in proximity with the other is &quot;more precious than the fact of being given.&quot;) It is also more demanding. As such, the ethical relation escapes thematiza- tion. To reduce it to a theme, a principle, a being, an arche, was the mistake of onto-theo-logy. To let being flow in the poetry of language, in its giftgiving, its play, is also to turn from the ethical exigency to the ontological exigency, for</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;"> being wants only to persevere in being. Ethics occurs</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">- to return posi- tively to Socrates -</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">across the hiatus of dialogue, not in the content of discourse</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">, in the continuities or discontinuities of what is said, but in the demand for response. &quot;It is better,&quot; Socrates said, &quot;to suffer evil than to do it.&quot; Socrates didn't realize that he could not prove this point, even though it was in effect while he spoke.</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">The responsibility</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> to respond to the other <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is,</span> for Levinas, precisely the inordinate responsibility, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the infinite responsibility</span> of being-<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">for-the-other</span> before oneself - the ethical relation.</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">What is said</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">[le dit]</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">can always be unsaid, re-said or revised - it is the saying</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;"> [le dire]</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">of it, the intrusion it effects, the interruption it inserts into continuities, as well as the passivity it calls forth, beneath identity, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that ac- complishes the priority and anteriority of ethics. The only alterity sufficiently other to provoke response,</span> to subject the subject to the subjection of response </span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">--which for Levinas is subjectivity itself, and the mean- ing of meaning, the event of ethics -</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">is the</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> absolute <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">alterity of the other person encountered in the</span> excessive immediacy of the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">face-to-face</span>.</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">Radical alterity figures in Levinas' thought not as a flaw, an ignorance, an obscurity, a childishness, a laziness or a de<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">f</span>erral, but as the non-thematizable charge through which ethics commands.</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">&quot;What ought to be&quot; - </span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">the subject's response to the Other -</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> relates to &quot;what is&quot; </span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">- being, essence, manifestation, phenomenon, identity -</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> not by some subtle or crude conversion into &quot;what is,&quot; but by haunting it, dis- turbing it, raising it to a moral height of which it is not itself capable.</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">The alterity of the other raises the subject in a severe responsibility which bears all the weight of the world's seriousness in a non-indiffer- ence - with no ontological basis - for the other. </span></span><br />

But for him the expression signifies the joy of what exists, the abundance, a little like the Heideggerian &quot;es gibt.&quot; For me, to the contrary, &quot;</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">there is&quot; is </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">the phenomenon of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">impersonal being</span>: &quot;it</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">.&quot; My reflection on this subject starts with child- hood memories.</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">One sleeps alone, the adults continue life; the child feels the silence </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">of his bedroom <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">as &quot;rumbling. &quot;</span></span></span> </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">Ph.N.: A rumbling silence? E.L.: It is something resembling what one hears when one puts an empty shell close to the ear<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">, </span></span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">as if the emptiness were full, as if the silence were a noise</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. It is something one can also feel when one thinks that even if there were nothing, the fact that &quot;there is&quot; is undeniable. Not that there is this or that; but</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">the very scene of being is open: there is. In the absolute emptiness that one can imagine before creation-- there is.</span></span> </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">Ph.N.: A moment ago you evoked the &quot;es gibt,&quot; the German &quot;there is,&quot; and the analysis Heidegger made of it as generosity, since in this &quot;es gibt&quot; there is the verb geben which signifies to give. For you, on the other hand, there is no generosity in the &quot;there is&quot;? E.L.:</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">I insist in fact on the impersonality of the &quot;there is&quot;; &quot;there is,&quot; as &quot;it rains,&quot; or &quot;its night.&quot; <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">And there is neither joy nor abundance: it is a noise returning after every negation of this noise. Neither nothingness nor being</span></span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. I sometimes use the expres- sion: the excluded middle. One cannot say of this &quot;there is&quot; which persists that it is an event of being</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">One can neither say that it is nothingness, even though there is nothing</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">. Existence and Existents tries to describe this horrible thing, and </span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">moreover</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">describes it as horror and panic.</span> Ph.N.: <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The child who</span> on his bed <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">senses the night dragging on has an experience of horror</span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. . . E.L.: ... Which nevertheless is not an anxiety. The book appeared with a wrapper where I had inscribed: &quot;Where it is not a question of anxiety.&quot; Everyone began to speak alot about anxiety in Paris, in 1947 . . . Other experiences, all close to the &quot;there is,&quot; are described in this book, notably that of ins om- nia. In insomnia one can and one cannot say that there is an &quot;I&quot; which cannot manage to fall asleep. The impossibility of escaping wakefulness is some- thing &quot;objective,&quot; independent of my initiative</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">.</span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">This impersonality absorbs my consciousness; conscious- ness is depersonalized. I do not stay awake: &quot;it&quot; stays awake. Perhaps death is an absolute negation wherein &quot;the music ends&quot; (however, one knows noth- ing about it). But</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">in the maddening &quot;experience&quot;</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> of the &quot;there is,&quot; <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">one has the impression of a total impossibility of escaping it, of &quot;stopping the music</span></span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">.&quot; It is a theme I have found in Maurice Blanchot, even though he does not speak of the &quot;there is,&quot; but of the &quot;neutral&quot; or the &quot;outside.&quot; He has a number of very suggestive formulas: he speaks of the &quot;hustle-bustle&quot; of being, of its &quot;clamor,&quot; its &quot;mur- mur.&quot; A night in a hotel room where, behind the partition, &quot;it does not stop stirring&quot;; &quot;one does not know what they are doing next door.&quot; This is some- thing very close to the &quot;there is.&quot; It is not a matter of &quot;states of the soul,&quot; but of an end of objectivizing consciousness, a psychological inversion. This is prob- ably the real subject of his novels and stories. Ph.N.: Do you mean to say that in Blanchot's works there is neither psychology nor sociology, but ontology? For in this &quot;there is,&quot; whether it is horrible or not, what is at play is being? E.L.: In Blanchot</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">it is no longer being, and it is no longer &quot;something,&quot; and it is always necessary to unsay what one says</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> - it is an event which is neither being nor nothingness. </span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">In his last book,2</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Blanchot called this &quot;disaster,&quot;</span> which signifies neither death nor an accident, but as <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a piece of being which would be detached from its fixity of being, from its reference to a star, from all </span>cosmological <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">existence, a dis-aster</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">.</span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">His gives an almost verbal sense to the substantive disaster. It seems that for him it is impossible to escape from this maddening, obsessive situation. In the short book of 1947 of which we are now speaking, as in that which followed it under the title of Time and the Other in 1948, the ideas to which I hold today are still sought, a good many of the intuitions arise which mark a distance covered rather than an ending. What is presented as exigency is an attempt to escape the &quot;there is,&quot; to escape the non- sense. In Existence and Existents, I analyzed other modalities of being, taken in its verbal sense: fatigue, indolence, effort. In these phenomena I showed a dread before being, an impotent recoil, an evasion and, consequently, there too, the shadow of the &quot;there is.&quot; Ph.N.:</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">What was the &quot;solution</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">&quot; you proposed? E.L.: My first idea was that perhaps <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a &quot;being,&quot;</span> a &quot;something&quot; <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">one could point at with a finger, corresponds to a mastery over the &quot;there is</span></span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">&quot;</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;"> which dreads in being.</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">I spoke thus of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the determinate</span> being or existent as <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a dawn of clarity in the horror of the &quot;there is,&quot; </span>a moment where the sun rises, where things appear for themselves, where <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">they are not borne by the &quot;there is&quot; but dominate it.</span></span></span> </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">Does one not say that the table is, that things are?</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">Then one refastens being to the existent, and already the ego there dominates the existents it possesses.</span></span> </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">I spoke thus of the &quot;hypostasis&quot; of existents, that is, the passage going from being to a something, from the state of verb to the state of thing. Being which is posited, I thought, is &quot;saved.&quot; In fact</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">,</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">this idea was only a first stage. For <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the ego that exists is encumbered by all</span> </span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">these existents it dominates. For me the famous Heideggerian &quot;Care&quot; took the form of the cumber- someness of existence. From whence an entirely different movement:</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">to escape</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> the &quot;there is&quot; <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">one must</span> not <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">be</span> posed but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">deposed</span>; to make an act of deposition, in the sense one speaks of deposed kings. </span><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">This deposition of sovereignty by the ego is the social relationship with the Other</span></strong><span style="font-family: Garamond;">, </span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">the dis-inter-ested relation. I write it in three words to underline the escape from being it signifies. I distrust the compromised word &quot;love,&quot; but</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the responsibility for the Other</span>, being-for-the-other, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">seemed</span> </span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">to me, as early as that time</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to stop the anonymous and senseless rumbling</span> of being. It is in the form of such a relation that the deliverance from the &quot;there is&quot; appeared to me</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">.</span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">Since that compelled my recognition and was clarified in my mind, I have hardly spoken again in my books of the &quot;there is&quot; for itself. But the shadow of the &quot;there is,&quot; and of non- sense, still appeared to me necessary as the very test of dis-inter-estedness.</span></span><br />

<span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">There is first the very uprightness of the face, its upright exposure, without defense</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">The skin of the face is that which stays most naked, most destitute.

At the same time, the face is what forbids us to kill</span>. Ph.N.: <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">War stories tell us</span> in fact that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it is difficult to kill someone who looks straight at you</span></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">.</span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">E.L.: The face is signification, and significa- tion without context. I mean that the Other, in the rectitude of his face, is not a character within a context. Ordinarily one is a &quot;character&quot;: a professor at the Sorbonne, a Supreme Court justice, son of so-and-so, everything that is in one's passport, the manner of dressing, of presenting oneself. And all signification in the usual sense of the term is relative to such a context: the meaning of something is in its relation to another thing. Here, to the contrary, the face is meaning all by itself. You are you. In this sense one can say that the face is not &quot;seen&quot;. It is what cannot become a content, which your thought would embrace; it is uncontainable, it leads you beyond. It is in this that the signification of the face makes it escape from being, as a correlate of a knowing. Vision, to the contrary, is a search for adequation; it is what par excellence absorbs being. But</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">the relation to the face is straightaway ethical. The face is</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> what one cannot kill, or at least it is that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">whose meaning consists in saying: &quot;thou shalt not kill</span>.&quot; Murder, it is true, is a banal fact: one can kill the Other; the ethical exigency is not an ontological necessity.</span></span> </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">The prohibition against killing does not render murder impossible, even if the authority of the prohibition is maintained in the bad conscience about the accomplished evil - malignancy of evil. It also appears in the Scriptures, to which the humanity of man is exposed inasmuch as it is engaged in the world. But to speak truly, the appearance in being of these &quot;ethical peculiarities&quot; - the humanity of man- is a rupture of being. It is significant, even if being resumes and recovers itself. Ph.N.: The Other is face; but the Other, equal- ly, speaks to me and I speak to him. Is not human discourse another way of breaking what you call &quot;totality&quot;? E.L.: Certainly. Face and discourse are tied. The face speaks. It speaks, it is in this that it renders possible and begins all discourse. I have just refused the notion of vision to describe the authentic relationship with the Other; it is discourse and, more exactly, response or responsibility which is this authentic relationship. Ph.N.: But since the ethical relationship is beyond knowledge, and, on the other hand, it is authentically assumed through discourse, it is thus that discourse itself is not somethiqg of the order of knowledge? E.L.: In discourse I have always distinguished, in fact, between the saying and the said. That the saying must bear a said is a necessity of the same order as that which imposes a society with laws, institu- tions and social relations. But the saying is the fact that</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">before the face I do not simply remain</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> there contemplating it<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">, I respond to it. The saying is a way of greeting the Other, but to greet</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Other is already to answer for him. It is difficult to be silent in someone's presence</span>; this difficulty has its ultimate foundation in this signification proper to the saying, whatever is the said. It is necessary to speak of something, of the rain and fine weather, no matter what, but to speak, to respond to him and already to answer for him. </span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">Ph.N.:</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">In the face of the Other you say there is an &quot;elevation,&quot; a &quot;height</span>.&quot;</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">The Other is higher than I am. What do you mean by that? E.L.:</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">The first word of the face is the &quot;Thou shalt not kill.&quot; It is an order.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> There is a command- ment in the appearance of the face, as if a master spoke to me.</span></span> </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">However, </span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">at the same time, the face of the Other is destitute; it is the poor for whom I can do all and to whom I owe all. And <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">me, whoever I may be, but as a &quot;first person,&quot; I am he who finds the resources to respond to the call.</span> </span></span><br />

<span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">E.L.: In describing the face positively, and not merely negatively .

<span style="margin-bottom: 5.75pt;"><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">Radical alterity figures in Levinas’ thought not as a flaw, an ignorance, an obscurity, a childishness, a laziness or a deferral, but as the non-thematizable charge through which ethics commands. “What oughtto be” –the subject’s response to the Other – relates to “what is” –being essence, manifestation, phenomenon, identity – not by some subtle or crude conversion into “what is,” but by haunting it, disturbing it, raising t to a moral height of which it is not itself capable. </span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">The alterity of the other raises the subject in a severe responsibility which bears all the weight of the world’s seriousness in a non-indifference – with no ontological basis – for the other. When in the late 1930s <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the British</span> </span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">colonial </span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">administrators <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">asked Gandhi what he expected from his annoying non-violent agitation</span>, the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Mahatma replied</span> that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">he expected the British would quit India</span>. They would quit India <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">on their own because they would come to see they were wrong</span>. Moral force is a scandal for ontological thinking, whether that thinking is gently attuned to being or imposing its subjective will. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The power of ethics is entirely different from the power of identities</span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">,</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;"> whether poetic or political, whether knowledge or administration. It escapes and judges the synthesizing, centralizing forces. </span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">Ethics is forceful not because it opposes power with more power, on the same plane, with a bigger army, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">more guns, a finer microscope or a grander space program, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">but</span> rather <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">because it opposes power with what appears to be weakness</span> and vulnerability <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">but is responsibility and sincerity. To the calculations of power, ethics opposes less than power can conquer. With their lathi sticks the British</span> occupational police <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">struck their opponents</span>, hurt them dreadfully, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">but</span> at the same time <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">they were hitting their own injustice</span>, their own inhumanity, and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">with each blow</span> non-violently <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">received were taught a moral lesson</span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. Not that they were necessarily taught a lesson: ethics is not ontology, it is not necessary, one can kill. </span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">Moral force</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">however</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">the proximity of the face-to-face, the height and destitution of the other’s face, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is the </span>ever patient <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">counterbalance to all the powers of the world, including nuclear power,</span> including nuclear power. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Moral force is not stronger than the powers of being</span> </span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">and essence, the totalizing, synthesizing powers, it is better, </span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">and this is its ultimate strength. </span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">Does Levinas' philosophy, then, come down to the escapist lament of slavery, failure, cowardice and inability?

Does not the war perpetuate that which it is called to make disappear</span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">, and consecrate war and its virile virtues in good conscience? One has to recon- sider the meaning of a certain human weakness, and no longer see in patience only the reverse side of the ontological finitude of the human.

<span style="margin-bottom: 5.75pt;"><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">This is not to suggest that Levinas’ solution</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> to the problem of violence <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">lies simply in the individual’s act</span> of responsibility</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 13pt;">. </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">It is neither that simple nor that simplistic. In ‘Judaism and revolution’, a very complex commentary dealing with the relationship of Aronowicz the Jewish tradition and the State, Levinas makes clear that the State itself is responsible for guaranteeing conditions that permit for the fulfillment of the human (Levinas 1990: 99). Yet </span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">the State</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">claims a universalism that is deceptive, for</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">while it attempts to protect the individual person,</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">it</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">limits</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">protection to its own and thus divides the world into an ‘us and them’, quelling the responsibility of one to the other,</span> beyond any distinctions whatsoever</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">. The Jewish tradition’s universalism, on the other hand, does not recognize limits to responsibility for the other person. It thus introduces a wedge between the Jewish people and the State, for the latter cannot limit the responsibility of the former. As such, the Jewish tradition always signals a loyalty beyond the State, and propels political activity in two directions. The first is in the direction of care for the most vulnerable members within it, setting the standard by which the State offers guarantees against dehumanization (Levinas 1990: 99-100). The second is in refusing to identify the good with a particular State, thus preventing the State from turning into an object of idolatry. Levinas warns, however, that </span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">even a revolutionary movement</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> whose aim is to overthrow a hopelessly corrupt government <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">can turn into a mirror image of the violence it contests, dividing the world into us and them just as much. A revolution always risks the very thing it is opposing</span>.</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">This does not mean that revolution is never justified but once again,</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">we are left, as our only recourse, vigilance against abuses, rather than a once and for all transformation: Revolutionary action is</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> first of all the action of the isolated man who plans revolution not only in danger but also in the agony of conscience. In the agony of conscience that risks making revolution impossible: for it is not only a question of seizing the evil-doer but also of not making the innocent suffer</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">(Levinas 1990: 110). Admittedly, my interpretation of these commentaries goes very fast over very complex materials that do not allow such breezy summarizations. Nonetheless, I would maintain that Levinas never meant his philosophy of the other as a solution to the problem of violence, as if, if properly understood and enacted, it would institute another course in history. History is what it is. Within these strictures,</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">one needs to respond constantly against</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">that</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">violence, pushed into it</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">not so much by principle as</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">by that unavoidable responsibility in the face of the nakedness of the other</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> person.</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">Perhaps this is what Ponzio’s essay actually attempts to say. If so, it could have been made clearer for at times it sounds as though Levinas’ thought was opposed in principle to capitalism and to war. It is not that Levinas’ thought is for either. Rather, his writings assume that</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">whatever the system running the</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> State or the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">world, it will always involve violence</span> to the other. This does not mean resignation. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">It means unending involvement to stave off the moment of betrayal</span>. In this respect, it is a very non-utopian approach to politics. </span></span></span><br />

According to this principle,</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">when there is a causal connection between</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> some <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">person A’s</span> performing some <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">action</span> (or inaction) <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and</span> some other person <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">B incurring</span> a certain <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">harm Z, A’s moral responsibility for Z is removed if, between X and Z, there intervenes some other action Y of some person B</span> who knows the relevant circumstances of his action and who intends to produce Z or who produces Z through recklessness The reason for this removal is that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">B's intervening action Y is the more direct</span> or proximate <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">cause of Z and unlike A's action (or inaction), Y is the sufficient condition of Z as it actually occurs</span></span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 11pt;">.</span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">An example of this principle may help to show its connection with the absolutist thesis.</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">Martin Luther <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">King</span> Jr. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">was</span> repeatedly <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">told that because he led demonstrations in support of civil rights, he was morally responsible for the </span>disorders, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">riots</span>, and deaths <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that ensued</span> and that were shaking the American Republic to its foundations. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">By the principle of the intervening action</span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">, however,</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">it was King’s opponents who were responsible because their intervention operated as the sufficient conditions of the riots and injuries</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">. </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">King might also have replied that the republic would not be worth saving if the price that had to be paid was the violation of the civil rights of Black Americans. As for the rights of other Americans to peace and order, the reply would be that those rights cannot be justifiably secured at the price of the rights of blacks.</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">It follows</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> from the principle of the intervening action <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that it is</span></span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">not the son but rather</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">the terrorists who are, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">morally as well as causally <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">responsihle</span></span></span><br />
<span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> for the </span>many <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">deaths that may ensue on his refusal to torture his mother</span></span></span><br />
<span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> to death</span>.</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">The important point is not that he lets these persons die rather</span></span><br />
<span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;"> than kills them, or that he does not harm them but, only fails to help them,</span></span><br />
<span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;"> or that he intends their deaths only obliquely but not directly. The point</span></span><br />
<span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;"> is rather that</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Garamond;">it is only through the intervening lethal actions</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> of the terrorists</span></span><br />
<span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that his refusal eventuates in the many deaths. Since the</span> moral <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">responsibility</span></span></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">Yet for some reason, at least partially explicated in Richard Rorty's Achieving Our Country, a book that I think is long overdue, leftist critics continue to cite and refer to the eccentric and often a priori ruminations of people like those just mentioned, and a litany of others including Derrida, Deleuze, Lyotard, Jameson, and Lacan, who are to me hugely more irrelevant than Habermas in their narrative attempts to suggest policy prescriptions (when they actually do suggest them) aimed at curing the ills of homelessness, poverty, market greed, national belligerence and racism. I would like to suggest that it is time for American social critics who are enamored with this group, those who actually want to be relevant, to recognize that they have a disease, and a disease regarding which I myself must remember to stay faithful to my own twelve step program of recovery. The disease is the need for elaborate theoretical &quot;remedies&quot; wrapped in neological and multi-syllabic jargon. These</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">elaborate theoretical remedies are more &quot;interesting,&quot; </span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">to be sure</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">than</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">the</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">pragmatically settled questions</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">about what shape democracy should take in various contexts, or whether private property should be protected by the state, or regarding our basic human nature (</span></span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">described</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">, if not defined (heaven forbid!),</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">in such statements as &quot;We don't like to starve&quot; and &quot;We like to speak our minds without fear of death&quot;</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">and &quot;We like to keep our children safe from poverty&quot;). As Rorty puts it, &quot;When one of today's academic leftists says that some topic has been 'inadequately theorized,' you can be pretty certain that he or she is going to drag in either philosophy of language, or Lacanian psychoanalysis, or some neo-Marxist version of economic determinism. . . .</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">These <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">futile attempts to philosophize</span> one's way <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">into</span> political <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">relevance are</span> a symptom of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">what happens when a Left retreats from activism</span> and adopts a spectatorial approach to the problems of its country. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Disengagement</span> from practice <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">produces</span> theoretical <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">hallucinations</span></span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">&quot;(italics mine).(1) Or as John Dewey put it in his The Need for a Recovery of Philosophy, &quot;I believe that philosophy in America will be lost between chewing a historical cud long since reduced to woody fiber, or an apologetics for lost causes, . . . . or a scholastic, schematic formalism, unless it can somehow bring to consciousness America's own needs and its own implicit principle of successful action.&quot; Those who suffer or have suffered from this disease Rorty refers to as the Cultural Left, which left is juxtaposed to the Political Left that Rorty prefers and prefers for good reason. Another attribute of the Cultural Left is that its members fancy themselves pure culture critics who view the successes of America and the West, rather than some of the barbarous methods for achieving those successes, as mostly evil, and who view anything like national pride as equally evil even when that pride is tempered with the knowledge and admission of the nation's shortcomings. In other words</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">the Cultural Left</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">in this country</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">too often dismiss American society as beyond reform and redemption</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">And Rorty correctly argues that</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">this is a disastrous conclusion</span></span><span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">, i.e. disastrous for the Cultural Left. I think it may also be disastrous for our social hopes, as I will explain.</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">Leftist American culture critics might put their considerable talents to better use if they bury some of their cynicism</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">about America's social and political prospects</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">and help forge public and political possibilities</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">in a spirit of determination to, indeed, achieve our country - the country of Jefferson and King; the country of John Dewey and Malcom X; the country of Franklin Roosevelt and Bayard Rustin, and of the later George Wallace and the later Barry Goldwater. To invoke the words of King, and with reference to the American society, the time is always ripe to seize the opportunity to help create the &quot;beloved community,&quot; one woven with the thread of agape into a conceptually single yet diverse tapestry that shoots for nothing less than a true intra-American cosmopolitan ethos, one wherein both same sex unions and faith-based initiatives will be able to be part of the same social reality, one wherein business interests and the university are not seen as belonging to two separate galaxies but as part of the same answer to the threat of social and ethical nihilism.</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Garamond;">We</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> who fancy ourselves philosophers <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">would do well to create</span> from within ourselves</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond;

but more important</span></span> <span class="cardtextununderlined"><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 6pt;">to the prospect of our flourishing - questions such as &quot;How is it possible to develop a citizenry that cherishes a certain hexis, one which prizes the character of the Samaritan on the road to Jericho almost more than any other?&quot; or &quot;How can we square the political dogma that undergirds the fantasy of a missile defense system with the need to treat America as but one member in a community of nations under a &quot;law of peoples?&quot;</span></span> <span class="cardtextunderlined"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Garamond;">The new public philosopher might seek to understand</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> labor law and military and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">trade theory and doctrine</span> as much as theories of surplus value;
