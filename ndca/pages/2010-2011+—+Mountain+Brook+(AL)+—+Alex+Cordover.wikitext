Hiroshima
I will begin with a story from Matsuda Go – a fragment of memory from August 6, 1945.
(Hiroshima Survivior, qtd. in Yoneyama, Lisa. //Hiroshima Traces: Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory.// Univ of Calif Press. pp. 129-130. 1999.)

A person was ... yet been disclosed.
That comes from a book that tells the story of a man who refused to stop talking about Hiroshima. Matsuda’s story reflects his rage as he slowly died over decades from the after-effects of Hiroshima. The powerful rage of his memory continues to haunt his audiences, provoking powerful reflections on life and death, war and peace.

These reactions suggest ... what I experienced.
We have turned away from Hiroshima to contemplate the apocalypse. It is easier to conceive of nuclear weapons through the lens of massive nuclear conflict than confront the meaning of our grandparents’ crimes.

When Michael Heyman ... for that reflection.

Hiroshima taught us that in times of traumatic vulnerability the proper response is to obliterate any threat that stands in our way. The war on terror has signified that we are still upholding the psyche that dropped the bomb. According to this understanding, the world is something that is easy to control and master as populations become reduced to statistics. Wars are waged for greater virtues such as peace or justice as a denial of vulnerability. Any hope for change must allow the memory of Hiroshima to fully haunt us and remind us that America is the main practitioner of global terror.

Things CP
States ought possess nuclear things. 
Their deployment of the words “nuclear weapons” ensures the continuance of the violence that causes nuclear danger in the first place.

Thus the language ... oppose prudential regulations.
By using the terms of the opposition, the ENTIRE anti-nuclear movement is effectively disabled. Only by changing language can the movement force the debate onto their own terms, putting proponents of nuclear things on the defensive.

Before concluding with ... entire antinuclear movement.
Using the traditional nuclear language ensures that the movement plays the role of the loyal opposition – it may be heard, but any time a decision has to be made, decision-makers will reject the movement.

Joining the words “nuclear” and “weapon” is a strategy of the anti-nuclear movement’s opposition. Employing these terms devastates the movement’s ability to create change.

Nuclear weaponry is a phenomenon whose essential feature is being fabulously textual. Total nuclear war has not happened; it is something that we can only come to know through fiction and fantasy. Yet despite having no real referent, nuclearism demands political and social attention in ways that bring about the threat they attempt to solve for.
<span class="cite">Klein 08 </span>(Richard, Professor at Cornell, “Knowledge of the Future: Future Fables,” Diacritics, Volume 38, Number 1-2, Spring-Summer, Project Muse)
In a 1984 ... in our dreams. 
The AC politics locks us in the nuclear bunker, endlessly fantasizing and calculating scenarios of destruction that will never happen. Life becomes a hollow shell devoid of the danger and beauty inherent to it, all under the banner of survival and prolonging death. 
<span class="cite">Baudrillard 81</span> (Jean, French Postmodern Theorist, __Simulacra and Simulation__, P. 34-7)
The apotheosis of ... world is satellized.
It’s the end of the world and I feel fine. Our alternative is to laugh in the face of the bomb. Instead of fetishizing a fear of the bomb inherent in the affirmative, we need to deprive the bomb of all meaning. It cannot remain the defining aspect of international relations and politics, where no communication or dialogue is possible. Voting negative challenges the way the bomb defines the status quo culture of fear, using the power of the bomb against itself.
