A Credible Strategy Federal budget deficits and debt are massive today— and future spending and debt projections are far worse if Congress and the President fail to act. Federal spending was about 23 percent of GDP in 2012—far above the historical average of 20.2 percent. It is projected to surge to nearly 36 percent in less than one generation. This spending is the cause of the chronic deficits that are driving the debt higher yet. Public debt is projected to reach 87 percent of GDP by 2023 and rise sharply in later years.

John P Surma, chairman and CEO of United States Steel Corp,<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Pittsburgh and also the current chairman of AISI </span>said<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">that </span>while the US steel industry isclearly in recovery mode, it is still facing<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">certain </span>significant challenges to its international competitiveness, including burdensome tax rates, uncertain energy costs, inadequate investments in infrastructure, increasing regulatory burdens <span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">and foreign unfair trade practices. “These issues are not new, but the urgency for us to address them is very, very immediate,” he stressed. Steel drives recovery As highlighted by a recent report written by Prof Timothy J Considine, an economist with the University of Wyoming, </span>the steel industry a major factor in the recent rebound of the US manufacturing sector<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">, which, according to Thomas J Gibson, AISI’s president and CEO, has consistently grown since 2010 and continues to drive the economy out of the recession. Nevertheless, he says there is an urgent need to address key policy issues to help continue the resurgence of the steel industry.</span>

And, Only //long-term// infrastructure investment generates demand for steel-an NIB solves
Steel Times International 12<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(a magazine for the steel industry, “American Iron and Steel Institute calls for further Government intervention”, 4/25/12, AD: 7/17/12, http://www.steeltimesint.com/contentimages/features/AISI-USAbriefing.pdf) </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Transport infrastructure </span>AISI is also calling for<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the US </span>Congress to pass a new, robust, long term surface transportation bill<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as opposed to continually extending the old one three months or so at a time. “</span>We must make rebuilding our crumbling transportation infrastructure system a top national priority<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” Surma says, adding that doing so is essential to doing business efficiently and for the US to maintain its dominant role in the global economy. Just before Congress went on recess in late March it passed its ninth 90-day extension of the surface transportation bill, which will guarantee funding for the nation’s bridges, highways and roads until June 30. The US House of Representatives in mid-April passed what would be a tenth 90-day extension, taking the bill to the end of September, although that bill is not expected to pass the Senate because of factors relating to the Keystone XL pipeline which is being opposed by some environmental groups. Gibson says </span>these extensions of the bill will not provide the boost that the US economy, and the steel industry, needs.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “</span>We need a longterm bill with level funding so that the states can plan the bigger construction projects that can produce the valuable jobs and generate the demand for steel, concrete and other materials. “Our preference would be the longest, most robustly funded bill that this Congress can produce<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” Surma says, which would be the House leadership’s five-year, $260bn surface transportation authorization bill, which, if passed, would include energy and natural resource provisions to open up on-shore and offshore bans for oil and gas drilling leases. Gibson lauded the Senate for doing its job and passing a two year, $109bn reauthorization bill in mid-March. Now, he says the House, which has not passed a bill yet, must act and pass a bill that could be conferenced with the Senate measure. The question, however, lies in how to pay for such a bill given all the concerns of the burgeoning US deficit. “</span>Transportation is a core function of government and it costs something to fund<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” </span>Gibson<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> says, however, he </span>observes that the traditional way to do that, the highway fund, which is funded by a tax on gasoline, is falling short<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, partly because vehicles are becoming more fuel efficient and Americans are changing their driving behavior. He called on the government to be more creative in finding a funding solution, including</span>

Vibrant domestic industry is key to __green technology__ and __significantly__ reducing CO2 emissions
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">RP Newswires 9</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(citing Thomas J. Gibson, CEO and President of the American Iron and Steel Institute, Reliable Plant Newswires, 2009, “U.S. steelmakers leading green, industrial renaissance”, [[http://www.reliableplant.com/Read/20164/us-steelmakers-leading-green,-industrial-renaissance]])</span>

One of America's best kept secrets is the extent to which its domestic steel industry has been a leader in the country's industrial renaissance<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Thomas J. Gibson, president and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) points out, as leaders from around the world head to Pittsburgh this week for the G-20 Summit. While domestic steel production has moved to different regions of the country over the years, U.S. Steel is headquartered there, one of the nation's top steel producers, and innovative technologies are what continue to push American steel into the forefront of world steel achievements. "</span>Steel productivity has more than tripled<span style="font-size: 8pt;">since the early 1980s leading the way among manufacturers, </span>the industry has dramatically cut energy efficiency per ton of steel by 33 percent<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> since 1990, </span>and steel, the most recycled material on the planet, is the material that will help build America's green energy grid, its solar panels and its wind turbines<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as we continue to make the country stronger at home and abroad," Gibson said. Other ways </span>the steel industry has embraced the green movement <span style="font-size: 8pt;">include: · </span>being the only significant industry<span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the United States </span>to increase production while cutting energy consumption; · reducing energy intensity<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by 10 percent between 2002 and 2004, and by 15 percent since 2002; · generating only between 1 and 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.; · </span>being globally recycled more than aluminum, paper, glass and plastic combined. The American steel industry is currently conducting research on the next generation of iron and steelmaking technologies that will dramatically reduce or eliminate CO2 emissions. This research<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, called the CO2 Breakthrough Program, </span>represents significant progress towards carbon-free iron-making.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> One project under way at MIT produces iron by </span>molten oxide electrolysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (MOE) and </span>generates near zero CO2 emissions<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A second project called "Iron-making by Hydrogen Flash Smelting" now being conducted at the University of Utah, replaced carbon as a blast-furnace fuel with hydrogen.</span>

Warming causes extinction

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The findings of the comprehensive report: </span>'The impact of climate change<span style="font-size: 8pt;">on the world's marine ecosystems' </span>emerged from a synthesis of recent research on the world's oceans, carried out by two of the world's leading marine scientists<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One of the authors of the report is Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, professor at The University of Queensland and the director of its Global Change Institute (GCI). </span>'We may see sudden, unexpected changes that have serious ramifications<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for the overall well-being of humans</span>, including the capacity of the planet to support people. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is further </span>evidence that we are well on the way to<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the next great </span>extinction<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> event,' says Hoegh-Guldberg. 'The findings have enormous implications for mankind, particularly </span>if the trend continues. The<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> earth's </span>ocean, which produces half of the oxygen we breathe and absorbs 30 per cent of human-generated carbon dioxide<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, is equivalent to its heart and lungs. This study </span>shows <span style="font-size: 8pt;">worrying </span>signs of ill-health<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It's as if the earth has been smoking two packs of cigarettes a day!,' he added. 'We are entering a period in which the ocean services upon which humanity depends are undergoing massive change and in some cases beginning to fail', he added. The 'fundamental and comprehensive' </span>changes <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to marine life identified in the report </span>include rapidly warming and acidifying oceans, changes in water circulation and expansion of dead zones<span style="font-size: 8pt;">within the ocean depths. These are driving major changes in marine ecosystems</span>: less <span style="font-size: 8pt;">abundant coral </span>reefs,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> sea grasses and </span>mangroves<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (important</span> fish<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nurseries); fewer, smaller fish; a </span>breakdown in food chains<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; changes in the distribution of marine life; </span>and more <span style="font-size: 8pt;">frequent</span>diseases and pests<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> among marine organisms. Study co-author John F Bruno, associate professor in marine science at The University of North Carolina, says </span>greenhouse gas emissions are modifying many physical and geochemical aspects<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the planet's oceans, </span>in ways 'unprecedented<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in nearly a million years'. 'This is causing fundamental and comprehensive changes to the way marine ecosystems function,' Bruno warned, according to a GCI release. These findings were published in Science</span>
