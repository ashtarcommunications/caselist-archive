===<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 14.66px;">Advantage 1: Aerospace Competitiveness</span>=== 
===<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 14.66px;">Global development of SPS is inevitable – US inaction collapses aerospace competitiveness </span>===

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">And, Only a federal investment into SSP invigorates US aerospace leadership</span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">And, A collapsing aerospace sector takes down //__key sectors__// of US hegemony</span>

===<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 14.66px;">And, The impact is an all-out global conflict</span>===

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">And, Aerospace competitiveness //__drives economic growth__// – purely private sector approaches guarantee failure</span>

===<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 14.66px;">Advantage 2 is India</span>=== 
===<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 14.66px;">The plan dramatically boosts US-Indian cooperation on SPS</span>=== 

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">NSSO 7 – report by the National Security Space Office, a branch of the DOD</span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">And, India would be the frontrunner for partnership – that’s key to relations and further space cooperation – and only the plan solves</span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">Dinerman 9 – regular contributor to the Space Review</span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">(Taylor, “Sholld India and the US cooperate on space solar power?,” </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">[[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1389/1]]</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">, dml)</span>


<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">India’s space policy is at a watershed moment – cooperation with India allows us to define the partnership and prevent an arms buildup – treaties don’t solve</span>

===<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 14.66px;">And, this is reverse causal – a failure to cooperate over space policies causes Indian ASAT development</span>===

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">And, That spurs Pakistani and Iranian ASATs development – causes space debris</span>

===<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 14.66px;">And, Space debris will destroy early warning satellites, resulting in an accidental global nuclear war </span>===

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">Thus the plan: </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">The United States federal government should commit to developing four satellites for the purpose of space based solar power.</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: center;"> </span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">Solvency</span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 14.66px;">Development and funding of four SPS satellites is key to an effective SPS market and US space leadership</span>
