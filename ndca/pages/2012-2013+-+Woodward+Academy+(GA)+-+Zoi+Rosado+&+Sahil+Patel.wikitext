=Affirmative= 
==Plan== 
The United States federal government should increase its surface transportation infrastructure investment sufficient to achieve “minimum tolerable conditions” for roads and bridges and “state of good repair” for transit.

==Economic Stimulus Advantage== 
Advantage 1: Economic Stimulus
__First__, stimulus is __key to growth__ in the __short-term__—__no recovery__ without more government spending.
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Stone 12</span> — Chad Stone, Chief Economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, holds a Ph.D. in Economics from Yale University, 2012 (“Misguided Deficit and Inflation Fears Impede Economic Recovery,” //Economic Intelligence//—a //U.S. News & World Report// blog, July 12th, Available Online at http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/07/12/misguided-deficit-and-inflation-fears-impede-economic-recovery, Accessed 07-20-2012)
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Last week's disappointing jobs report</span> for June <span style="font-size: 13pt;">showed that a strong labor market recovery </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">remains elusive</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">... the benefits from increasing current economic activity would be </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">substantial</span>//. Policymakers can eliminate the future costs if they pair short-term stimulus with policies that reduce the deficit in the future when the economy is stronger.

__Second__, the plan __solves__—a substantial investment in infrastructure stimulus would __create jobs__ and __boost aggregate demand__.
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Blodget 12</span> — Henry Blodget, co-founder, CEO, and Editor-In Chief of //Business Insider//, former top-ranked Wall Street analyst, frequent contributor to the magazines //Slate//, //Newsweek//, and //New York//, 2012 (“Yes, It's Time For A Massive Infrastructure Spending Program,” //Business Insider//, June 19th, Available Online at [[http://www.businessinsider.com/infrastructure-spending-program-2012-6?op=1]], Accessed 09-03-2012)
I recently laid out the fundamental problem with the US economy:
//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Massive</span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> consumer </span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;">debts</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> and </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">high unemployment</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> are </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">crippling consumer spending</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">, which accounts for about 70% of our economy</span>... <span style="font-size: 13pt;">stimulus can </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">keep the economy from collapsing</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> while the private sector heals itself</span>.
And this, in turn, suggests that <span style="font-size: 13pt;">ruling out future stimulus in the form of infrastructure investment as a way to help the economy is </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">a major mistake</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">, especially with US infrastructure in such lousy shape and so many US workers idled by the construction industry slowdown</span>.

__Third__, infrastructure investment is __uniquely effective__ at stimulating the economy—__studies prove__.
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Boushey 11</span> — Heather Boushey, Senior Economist at the Center for American Progress, previously held economist positions with the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress, the Center for Economic and Policy Research, and the Economic Policy Institute, holds a Ph.D. in economics from the New School for Social Research, 2011 (“Now Is the Time to Fix Our Broken Infrastructure,” Center for American Progress, September 22nd, Available Online at http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/09/aja_infrastructure.html, Accessed 06-09-2012)
The value of infrastructure spending
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Analysis of all fiscal stimulus policies shows a higher “multiplier” from infrastructure spending than other kinds of government spending</span>... <span style="font-size: 13pt;">This number include jobs directly created by hiring for the specific project, jobs indirectly created by supplier firms, and jobs induced when workers go out and spend their paychecks and boost their local economy</span>.[8]

__Fourth__, states can’t __stimulate the economy__—__federal__ action is key.
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bernstein 11</span> — Jared Bernstein, Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, served as Chief Economist and Economic Advisor to Vice President Joe Biden, holds a Ph.D. in Social Welfare from Columbia University, 2011 (“More Q&A: States Can’t Do Countercyclical Policy and Noise re ‘Unfunded Liabilities’,” //On The Economy//—Jared Bernstein’s economics blog, July 4th, Available Online at http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/more-qa-states-cant-do-countercyclical-policy-and-noise-re-unfunded-liabilities/, Accessed 06-22-2012)
Q: What with the much benighted Washington debate, what can the states do to improve the economy – or more specifically, fight unemployment? A: <span style="font-size: 13pt;">The states can’t do much at all</span>...<span style="font-size: 13pt;">There’s </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">a</span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> very </span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;">important Keynesian punchline</span>// here: <span style="font-size: 13pt;">since states cannot offset their budget gaps with deficit spending, </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">the only countercyclical game in town is the federal gov’t</span>//. The state fiscal relief in the Recovery Act was fast-acting, effective stimulus, helping to retain needed jobs in communities, like teachers, cops, firefighters, sanitation workers, etc. As the stimulus has faded, layoffs have accelerated.


__And__, growth is __the controlling impact__—more important than deficits and taxes.
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Swanson 11</span> — Bret Swanson, President of Entropy Economics—a research firm focused on technology and the global economy, President of Entropy Capital—a venture firm that invests in early-stage technology companies, Visiting Fellow at Digital Society, Fellow at the National Chamber Foundation, former Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for Global Innovation at The Progress & Freedom Foundation, 2011 (“The Growth Imperative,” //Forbes//, May 27th, Available Online at [[http://www.forbes.com/sites/bretswanson/2011/05/27/the-growth-imperative/]], Accessed 08-29-2012)
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The central factor in America’s fiscal future is</span> hardly being discussed. In most conversations of deficits, entitlements, debt ceilings, and bond markets, //<span style="font-size: 13pt;">economic </span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;">growth</span>// goes unmentioned. In recent days, a few smart policy makers finally whispered it, yet not with the needed volume and specificity.
Perhaps the paltry 1.8% first quarter GDP figure, when our recovery should be generating 5% numbers, will get the nation’s attention. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Growth today is our biggest problem – but also our biggestopportunity</span>.
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">We’ve</span> all <span style="font-size: 13pt;">seen</span> the <span style="font-size: 13pt;">budget charts with steeply sloping outlays and trillion dollar deficits</span> stretching over the horizon, leading inevitably to skyrocketing debt... <span style="font-size: 13pt;">This Growth Test should </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">inform and </span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;">shape every debate</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">. Economic growth helps federal, state, and local budgets,</span> sure, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">but more importantly creates opportunity for generations of Americans, particularly those whose outlook today seems bleakest</span>.

__Fifth__, this accesses __every major impact__—economic growth is __vital__ to generate the resources needed to __meet emerging challenges__.
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Silk 93</span> — Leonard Silk, Distinguished Professor of Economics at Pace University, Senior Research Fellow at the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and former Economics Columnist with the //New York Times//, 1993 (“Dangers of Slow Growth,” //Foreign Affairs//, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
Like the Great Depression, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">the current economic slump has fanned the firs of </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">nationalist, ethnic and religious hatred</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> around the world...</span> //<span style="font-size: 13pt;">economic </span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;">growth</span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> – and growth alone – </span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;">creates the</span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> additional </span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;">resources that make it possible to achieve such fundamental goals</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> as </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">higher living standards</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">,</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">national</span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> and collective </span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;">security</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">, a </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">healthier environment</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">, and more </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">liberal</span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> and open </span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;">economies</span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> and </span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;">societies</span>//.

__And__, economic decline increases the risk of __war__—//__strong statistical support__//.
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Royal 10</span> — Jedidiah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, M.Phil. Candidate at the University of New South Wales, 2010 (“Economic Integration, Economic Signalling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” //Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives//, Edited by Ben Goldsmith and Jurgen Brauer, Published by Emerald Group Publishing, ISBN 0857240048, p. 213-215)
Less intuitive is how <span style="font-size: 13pt;">periods of economic decline</span> may //<span style="font-size: 13pt;">increase the likelihood of external conflict</span>//. Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent states... <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Those studies</span> tend to focus on dyadic interdependence instead of global interdependence and //<span style="font-size: 13pt;">do not specifically consider</span>// the occurrence of and conditions created by <span style="font-size: 13pt;">economic crises</span>. As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.

__Finally__, alternatives to growth __kill hundreds of millions__ and cause __global conflict__—we can’t “//__turn off__//” the economy.
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Barnhizer 6</span> — David R. Barnhizer, Emeritus Professor at Cleveland State University’s Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, 2006 (“Waking from Sustainability's "Impossible Dream": The Decisionmaking Realities of Business and Government,” //Georgetown International Environmental Law Review// (18 Geo. Int'l Envtl. L. Rev. 595), Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The scale of social needs, including the need for expanded productive activity, has grown so large that it </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">cannot be shut off</span>////<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> at all</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">, and </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">certainly not abruptly</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">... </span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">we cannot return to Eden</span>//<span style="font-size: 13pt;">. The question is not how to achieve a static state but how to achieve what is needed to advance social justice while avoiding and mitigating the most destructive consequences of our behavior</span>.

==U.S. Leadership Advantage== 
Advantage 2: U.S. Leadership
__First__, U.S. surface transportation infrastructure is __crumbling__—continued shortfalls will __decimate the economy and American competitiveness__.
