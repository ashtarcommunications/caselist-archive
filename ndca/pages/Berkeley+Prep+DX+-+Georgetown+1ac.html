Advantage One is Growth:<br />

Slow growth will persist – it’s the cause – not the consequence – of the economic crisis – reforming policy process is key<br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">It has become a cliché: the new normal. Indeed, so accustomed have Americans become to slow economic growth and stubbornly high unemployment, more than three years into the “recovery,” that it may not even seriously threaten Barack Obama’s re-election prospects. No one thinks the economy would be doing much better with someone else in the White House.¶ They are probably right. It is telling that neither Obama nor his Republican opponent has offered much of a plan to spur the economy, at least in the short term. So far as any-one has any short-term impact on the economy, it is the Federal Reserve, and even it is limited in what it can do. As it has been said, the Fed can print money, but it can’t print jobs.¶ It is common to fix the blame for this on the banking crisis. Economies typically take a long time to re-cover from “balance-sheet” re-cessions, as businesses and households focus on paying down debt and rebuilding savings. But what if the problem of slow growth has deeper roots than that? What if slow growth caused the crisis?¶ That’s the provocative thesis of the American economist Tyler Cowen, who spoke in Toronto Tuesday night. In his most recent book, The Great Stagnation, Cowen argues that slow growth is more the old normal than the new: Median incomes in the United States have been moving sideways for the better part of four decades, as have most measures of productivity.¶ While others have made much the same point, Cowen locates that decades-long slump in a still larger historical frame. Indeed, it may not be the era of stagnation that is the anomaly, but the long period of rapid growth that preceded it.¶ For the first three centuries or so of European settlement, he argues, America enjoyed the benefits of a number of “low-hanging fruit.” It had an abundance of arable land, for starters, which settlers could claim for free – and not only land, but resources. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, it had access to a similar abundance of labour, as millions left the farms for the cities; as, later, it could call upon seemingly endless re-serves of skilled labour, as more and more of these new workers went on to get an education.¶ And, perhaps most critic-ally, it profited from a truly astonishing series of inventions, from electricity to the light bulb to the automobile to the telephone. Much the same story could be told of other industrial countries, of course. But nowhere did land, labour and technological progress combine to produce such enormous wealth as in America.¶ But, one by one, the low-hanging fruit were eaten up. The land was soon allocated, tilled and mined. The movement of population into the cities and schools was completed: from 6 per cent in 1900, the high school graduation rate peaked at 80 per cent in the late 1960s. And, somewhere around 1970, technological progress seemed to hit a plateau. In-deed, by some measures the pace of innovation stalled some decades before that.¶ This seems hard to believe, in this age of technologic-al marvels. But set beside Cowen’s list of revolutionary advances from the early 20th century, from the air-plane to the assembly line to indoor plumbing, the point is at least arguable. What’s inarguable is the abrupt decline in productivity growth since the early 1970s, not only in the U.S. but over much of the industrial world – including, needless to say, Canada.¶ The problem, Cowen argues, is that Americans carried on (as to some extent we all did) as if nothing had changed – as if they would continue to grow steadily richer, just as they had before. When actual earnings failed to keep track with projected, they borrowed the difference. The financial crisis was the end result.¶ Is that, then, the future to which we are condemned, at least until some new burst of innovation lifts us off our technological plateau? Or are there still some low-hanging fruit within reach?¶ I’d argue there are. Globalization is one. The migration into the cities and schools that Cowen describes is going on today across the Third World. Trade allows us to benefit from that enormous increase in productive re-sources, as much as they.¶ The Internet is a second. Two decades on, it is still very much in its infancy: We have not begun to realize its potential. The Gutenberg revolution made books widely available: Why, even an ordinary person could own one – several, if he could afford them. Today, a smart phone makes all of human know-ledge available, to everyone, everywhere, all the time, instantaneously.¶ If we have not yet figured out how to take full advantage of that, we will surely do so in time.¶ And last, there is policy. Of all the things that determine how different nations will perform at different times, the most important by far, more even than land, labour or technology, is the organization of economic life. Russia has tons of land, lots of labour, brilliant scientists. What it hasn’t had, historically, is good policy.¶ I’m not suggesting we should look to some dazzling policy breakthrough to save us. Quite the contrary: we need only to abandon some of our worst policy mistakes. Imagine if investment decisions were based on the real </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">economic costs and benefits</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> of each, undistorted by the present welter of tax preferences or business subsidies. Suppose we permitted com-petition to flourish within our moribund public education and health monopolies.¶ Imagine if, rather than al-low traffic to choke our cities, we put a price on road use. And so on.¶ It’s not quite the light bulb. But it’s a start.</span><br />

<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Infrastructure forms the foundation of the U.S. economy</span>. Without highways, power grids, railroads, dams, levees, and water systems, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">businesses could not transport their goods</span>, homes would be without electricity or drinkable water, parents could not get their kids to school, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would cease to be a world leader in productivity and innovation</span>. But despite our infrastructure’s clear indispensability, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">decades of negligence and underinvestment have allowed much of it to fall into a shameful state of disrepair</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Inefficiencies in our infrastructure affect all aspects of American life</span>. Commuters on our highways now lose more than $100 billion every year in time spent and fuel burned due to ever-increasing congestion on their way to and from work.1 U.S. ports are struggling to handle increased ship sizes and cargo volumes. Lock systems on inland waterways are crumbling, causing tens of thousands of hours of delays every year. And leaking pipes lose an estimated 7 billion gallons of clean drinking water every day.2 Together, these failures jeopardize public health, contribute to environmental degradation, and make American businesses less competitive, forcing them to pass additional costs on to consumers.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">At the same time, our closest competitors have dramatically stepped up their investment in infrastructure and adopted ambitious plans for additional development</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">fell to 24th place</span> in overall infrastructure, down from ninth in 2008, according to a 2011 annual survey conducted by the World Economic Forum.3 What’s worse, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">under current levels of investment, this ranking will likely only continue to fall</span>. A recent Center for American Progress report on America’s infrastructure funding gap estimated that the federal government is underinvesting in infrastructure by approximately $48 billion per year, assuming a goal of adequately maintaining existing infrastructure and preparing for projected economic and population growth.4¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But our situation is not hopeless</span>. By coupling increased investment with a number of commonsense reforms, the United States could make great progress toward¶ bringing its infrastructure up to modern standards. The establishment of both a national infrastructure bank and a national infrastructure planning council represents an innovative and promising way in which we could finance and plan infrastructure projects. That is the subject of this report.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">By establishing a</span> centralized federal lending authority in the form of an <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">infrastructure bank, the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">could</span>:¶ •¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Increase public investment in infrastructure¶ </span>•¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Leverage billions in additional private investment¶ </span>•¶ Streamline existing federal lending initiatives¶ •¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Increase the share of federal money that flows to projects meeting rigorous cost-benefit criteria¶ </span>With a relatively modest investment, the federal government could enable the completion of numerous large-scale projects of critical economic importance throughout our country, potentially producing thousands of jobs in the process.¶ Forming a national infrastructure planning council would also help better coordinate federal investments in infrastructure. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This would go a long way toward resolving the siloed decision-making process that currently prevents crucial project integration and encourages inefficient spending across government agencies</span>, as each agency attempts to independently address single components of a complex, interdependent infrastructure system. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Better coordination would allow the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to finally develop a comprehensive national infrastructure plan</span> on par with those implemented by both industrialized and developing nations, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">while also encouraging the adoption of the best investment and planning practices at all levels</span>.¶ Congress and the Obama administration should be praised for taking a significant step toward better investment coordination and improved due diligence by expanding the Department of Transportation’s Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation program, included in the recently passed Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act. Increasing this program’s funding from $122 million in fiscal year 2012 (which began in October 2011) to a combined $1.7 billion for FY 2013 through FY 2014 will help it achieve a considerably greater impact. The program provides low-interest loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit to public and private investors undertaking large-scale surface transportation projects. Although the program’s limited surface-transportation-only focus and known funding horizon of only two years means it alone cannot shoulder the¶ burden of America’s infrastructure needs, the designers of any future infrastructure bank should look to this program as an example of how to successfully operate a federal infrastructure lending initiative.¶ This report will detail the need for both a national infrastructure bank and a planning council, explain how they each would work, and examine how they would address the specific failings of our current system of infrastructure investment. We will consider existing policy proposals for creating an infrastructure bank and will note which facets of these plans still require significant attention from policymakers. Finally, we will put forward a number of suggestions for immediate action to lay the groundwork for a national infrastructure bank and an infrastructure planning council.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">simply cannot wait any longer</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to address our crumbling infrastructure. If we take action now to better plan, finance, and coordinate critical investments in our national infrastructure, we can ensure continued prosperity for future generations, while immediately helping the American economy get back on its feet</span>.¶ The need for an infrastructure bank and planning council¶ The overwhelming scale of the challenges facing U.S. infrastructure cannot be adequately addressed by individual state and local efforts or piecemeal federal support. Our myriad overlapping and competing funding streams, programs, and initiatives have repeatedly proven to be inadequate, and the need for central entities to plan, coordinate, and finance projects of national importance could not be more apparent.¶ In this section, we examine the four greatest failings of our current infrastructure investment system and illustrate their detrimental effect on the U.S. economy:¶ •¶ Failure to provide sufficient public funds¶ •¶ Failure to attract private investment¶ •¶ Failure to coordinate investments¶ •¶ Failure to allocate funds efficiently¶ Let’s examine each of these failures in turn.¶ Failure to provide sufficient public funds¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Despite a large number of independent funding streams and initiatives for infrastructure development already in the federal government, the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is failing—by a large margin—to adequately invest in its infrastructure</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">These existing funding streams include multiple federal loan programs, a far greater number of grant opportunities, and many additional layers of programs at the state and local level</span>. A recent Center for American Progress report estimated that bringing America’s infrastructure into a state of good repair and adequately preparing it for projected growth would require the federal government to invest at least an additional $48 billion per year on top of current infrastructure spending levels, which in FY 2010 totaled roughly $92 billion in grants, credit subsidies, and tax expenditures.5¶ Even then, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">this spending </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">could only be considered sufficient if</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> it triggered $11 billion annually in additional state spending and was accompanied by a $10 billion increase in annual </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">federal loan authority</span></em>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is simply not investing enough to repair and maintain our most critical infrastructure, let alone expand and upgrade it to enable future economic growth</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This lack of sufficient funding and political will means we are</span> not only underfunding local water-treatment systems and roadway investments but also <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">perpetually neglecting large-scale regional projects. Such cross-state “megaprojects” have the potential to produce massive economic returns but frequently go unfunded or unconsidered because they are </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">simply too large</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> for states</span>, localities, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">or limited federal programs to finance</span>. While the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation program and similar initiatives may seek to support large-scale undertakings, it simply does not have the funds to provide the level of capital required for such megaprojects and is generally limited to funding projects that fall into a specific sector—such as surface transportation—instead of integrated, cross-sector proposals.¶ This problem is evident, for example, in ongoing efforts to replace the functionally obsolete Brent Spence Bridge that connects Cincinnati, Ohio, with Covington, Kentucky, carrying traffic from two large interstate highways across the Ohio River. Despite its critical importance to regional commerce and the economic vitality of both cities, project planners have not been able to find a funding source for the $2.4 billion needed to begin work.6 Even with combinations of grants, municipal bonds, and private investment, such projects often require an additional source of funding to make it out of the concept stage.7 Currently this source of funding does not exist, which means the very projects that hold the greatest potential to spur lasting economic growth are the most frequently abandoned.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">These problems are further compounded by a congressional appropriations process that allocates some infrastructure funds on a year-to-year basis and legislators who are sometimes reluctant to commit resources over the longer time frames required to complete most infrastructure projects</span>. The recently passed Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act surface-transportation bill provides program allocations for only two years—well short of the five-year timeframe of most of its predecessors. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This leaves states, localities, and private investors struggling to make long-term plans under the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">uncertainty of future federal support</span></em>.¶ Additionally, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">this annual appropriations process can encourage state and local policymakers to delay necessary projects in the hope of securing federal funding¶ in the next election cycle, both delaying benefits and potentially increasing costs, as required repairs become more significant</span>.8¶ Failure to attract private investment¶ Private investors can be valuable and innovative partners in maintaining and modernizing critical infrastructure. Our current system of financing, however, has often failed in its attempts to forge viable partnerships with private investors.¶ While the traditional American method of attracting private capital by offering tax-exempt municipal bonds has been successful in many instances and will remain a valuable tool for infrastructure investment, it often leaves many large potential investors sitting on the sidelines. The reason: These groups are either already exempt from taxes, as in the case of pension funds, or have no state tax liability to begin with, as is the case with international investors. These characteristics have historically made tax-exempt bonds far less attractive to these groups, resulting in extremely limited purchases.¶ In the wake of the Great Recession of 2007–2009, however, many of these institutional investors now say they are eager to diversify their portfolios by investing in infrastructure. The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, for example, has already allotted $4 billion to be invested in U.S. infrastructure projects over the next three years.9¶ The success of so-called Build America Bonds has demonstrated that alternatives to traditional municipal bonds can have success in attracting pension funds and international investors. The program, initiated in 2009, issued an estimated $117 billion in taxable state and local bonds for which the federal government directly subsidized a portion of the interest costs.10 This made the bonds significantly more attractive to private investors, eliminating inefficiencies in the system of federal bond subsidization that cost the federal government billions of dollars every year.11 Unfortunately, the program was allowed to expire in 2010 and has not yet been renewed.¶ Public-private partnerships offer shareholders a direct stake in projects, and the potential for greater returns are also extremely attractive to these types of private investors. Unfortunately, states and the federal government have not yet fully taken advantage of these new types of investment vehicles. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While 25 states have passed legislation expressly aimed at encouraging public-private partnerships, relatively few projects have actually been launched</span>.12¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This is largely because our infrastructure financing system lacks the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">experience and tools</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to quickly identify viable investment opportunities and match private investors with public partners</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Without improved </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">coordination</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, transparency, and financial assistance, billions of dollars more in potential investment may go unrealized despite the existence of numerous willing investors</span>. In contrast, Europe has a fully functioning infrastructure finance program up and running. (see box)¶ Lessons from the European Investment Bank¶ While the United States struggles to develop a national infrastructure investment plan, the European Union has been operating a transnational, publically chartered infrastructure bank for longer than half a century. Founded in 1957, the European Investment Bank funds critical projects throughout Europe and in developing nations worldwide to the tune of tens of billions of dollars every year.¶ The bank is capitalized by funds from its 27 member states but also raises a large portion of its capital from issuing bonds. These funds are used to offer low-interest, long-term loans to both public and private entities, as well as loan guarantees and technical assistance. The bank is able to offer such attractive rates because it is large, nonprofit, has a AAA credit rating, and is fully backed by member governments.13¶ In 2010 the bank loaned out more than $100 billion, the vast majority of which (87.5 percent) went to projects in EU countries.14 This included $5 billion in high-speed rail projects; $3 billion in road and bridge improvements; $12 billion in sustainable urban transit; and $134 million in inland waterway improvements.15 Overall, the bank financed 460 “large projects” in 72 countries in 2010 alone, and this was all on top of the investments made independently by individual member states.16¶ The European Investment Bank should serve as both a useful example for policymakers and as a harsh reminder of how the United States is continuing to fall further behind our international competition. Any U.S. infrastructure bank must learn from the successes and failures of its international predecessors and must do so quickly if we are to keep pace in the decades ahead.¶ * This report uses 2010 data to allow for easy comparison between European Investment Bank investment levels and federal U.S. loan authorities for infrastructure. (see Figure 1)¶ Failure to coordinate investments¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">uncoordinated</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and siloed fashion in which federal dollars are allocated also hampers efforts to modernize U.S. infrastructure</span>. Despite the interdependence of America’s electricity, water, transport, and telecommunications networks, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the vast majority of federal funds are dispersed by sector-specific programs that do not take into consideration the impact of their initiatives on other infrastructure systems</span>.¶ The Department of Transportation, for example, does not fully consider how increased investment in passenger or freight railways might alleviate the need for additional road and highway expenditures, and does not coordinate the landside port improvements it funds with Army Corps of Engineers waterside investments at the very same ports. Indeed, according to a recent Center for American Progress analysis, integrated transportation spending accounts for only about 2 percent of the Department of Transportation’s investments—a distressing figure for those concerned with maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs.17¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Exacerbating this problem is the inherently </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">reactive nature</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> of the many federal agencies responsible for various aspects of our nation’s infrastructure. Nearly all of the projects that agencies consider are brought to them by localities, states, or Congress. They are almost never asked to propose projects based on their own </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">analysis of national needs</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> or to take on the role of integrating multiple small-scale proposals</span>. Instead, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">they are only given the responsibility of evaluating individual pitches from policymakers primarily concerned with their own </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">limited constituencies</span></em>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Consequently</span>, the United States has no national goods movement, water, or energy plans to match those of other rapidly developing nations, and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">our economic competitiveness and prospects for growth are suffering as a result</span>.¶ Failure to allocate funds efficiently¶ Despite inadequate funding levels and limited program coordination, the United States still allocates tens of billions of dollars annually to a multitude of projects across the nation. Such investment could go further toward upgrading America’s infrastructure if it were spent more efficiently.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The vast majority of funds for infrastructure projects in the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are not disbursed on the basis of a </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">rigorous comparison of</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> projects’ economic </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">costs and benefits</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Instead, they are allocated by formula or annual congressional appropriations that place more emphasis on geographic political considerations than on return on investment</span>. For decades, highway funding has been distributed by formulas that heavily weigh vehicle miles of road over the actual need for repair or extension. As a result, Alabama has in the past received more funds than Massachusetts, Florida more than New York, and Georgia more than Michigan.18 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">inefficient process</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> is only getting worse, as the recently passed surface transportation bill actually increased the percentage of funds apportioned by formula from 83 percent to 92.6 percent.</span>19¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Highway spending</span>, however, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is not the only area where money is allocated in this fashion</span>. According to the Congressional Research Service, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the nation’s 20 busiest ports handle 80 percent of arriving oceangoing ships but account for less than 40 percent of federal Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund expenditures</span>.20 In the allocation of funds for drinking water projects, millions of dollars are allotted every year just to ensure that every state receives at least 1 percent of the funds available.21 Such processes virtually ensure a suboptimal distribution of investment, as money is directed according to arbitrary legal requirements not potential impact.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">America’s present system of infrastructure financing is failing on multiple fronts and falling well short of providing the levels of </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">coordinated</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">expertly directed</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> investment required to rebuild and modernize our aging bridges</span>, electrical grids, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and highways</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is clear that if the status quo is maintained, the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will only continue to fall further behind its neighbors and competitors—with significant and damaging repercussions for the future health of the U.S. economy</span>.¶ How would an infrastructure bank and planning council help?¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The establishment of a national infrastructure bank</span> and national planning council <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would go a long way toward making the existing system of infrastructure financing more rational, efficient, and transparent</span>. In this section, we lay out the potential benefits offered by both institutions and illustrate how they can immediately help remedy the failures of the status quo. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Americans deserve an infrastructure network befitting the largest and most innovative economy in the world, and creating a national infrastructure bank</span> and national planning council <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will do much to achieve that goal</span>.¶ National infrastructure bank¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A national infrastructure bank would help spur more infrastructure investment by creating a strong federal lending authority capable of financing and coordinating high-value infrastructure investments throughout the country. It could provide low-interest loans</span> and loan guarantees <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to state, local, and private investors, and help stakeholders connect available capital with financially viable projects and willing partners</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Because all of the funds distributed by the bank would be paid back with interest by borrowers following the completion of their projects</span>, the costs to the federal government following the initial capitalization of the bank would be remarkably low. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Every federal dollar put into the bank would be able to achieve an impact well beyond its face value by supporting project after project as long as the bank continued operation</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Despite its low costs, however, a national infrastructure bank could put a substantial dent in the infrastructure funding gap by attracting billions of dollars in additional public and private investment</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">By providing the final financial piece that many large projects require to get off the ground, federal infrastructure loans</span> and loan guarantees <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">could enable hundreds of otherwise-abandoned projects to move forward</span>. An infrastructure bank proposal put forward by Sens. John Kerry (D-MA), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) estimates that an initial $10 billion endowment could provide up to $160 billion in financial assistance over the next decade, pulling in between $320 billion and $640 billion in additional nonfederal spending.22 Such levels of investment would pour billions of dollars into some of the economic sectors hit worst by the recession, among them the construction industry and heavy manufacturing, and could help put thousands of unemployed Americans back to work on projects with guaranteed economic and social returns.¶ An infrastructure bank could be particularly effective at leveraging additional investment because it would be able to make such investment more attractive to private investors. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A federal bank could help </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">inexperienced states</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and localities develop attractive public-private partnerships and could connect willing private partners with these investment opportunities. Providing </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">a single “home”</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> for such project proposals would eliminate the need for investors to make redundant pitches to multiple federal, state, and local agencies, making the entire process of linking private capital with critical infrastructure projects both more efficient and user-friendly</span>. <em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Federal oversight</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and guidance could also perform the important task of promoting models that protect wages and collective bargaining rights</span>. For all of these reasons, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations see significant benefits for their members</span> should a national infrastructure bank be created, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and both have jointly come out in strong support of establishing such a bank</span>.23¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">An infrastructure bank would also help overcome the many problems associated with the annual appropriations process and could provide the types of financial assistance that are most useful for infrastructure projects. By providing long-term loans</span> and loan guarantees, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the new bank would make year-to-year federal support significantly </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">more predictable</span></em>. Short-line railroad owners could hire employees, and clean energy operations could plan for expansion <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">without being constrained by the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">uncertainty</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> of not knowing whether the critical federal loan programs that support them will exist in a year’s time</span>.¶ Additionally, by building delayed-repayment mechanisms into these loans, many crucial projects could be undertaken even if they may take time to begin generating sufficient user fees or savings to begin repayment. Public and private investors alike frequently find it difficult to acquire financing of this kind, but by filling this void, a national infrastructure bank could further enable billions of dollars in investment.¶ Furthermore, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">introducing a centralized federal lending authority could help dramatically improve </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">coordination</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> between federal agencies and the multiple lending¶ initiatives they oversee</span>. A recent Center for American Progress analysis estimated that in FY 2010, just under $124 billion in total federal lending authority for infrastructure projects was spread out over six different programs in three different departments. (see Figure 1) It would likely be more efficient for an infrastructure bank to assimilate these existing federal loan schemes. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Such changes would eliminate redundancies, build capacity to plan intermodal projects, and further improve due diligence in project selection</span>.¶ Energy is a major cost driver when it comes to getting water to the tap and treating wastewater, but our current system does not adequately account for energy needs when planning water-system improvements. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A federal lending authority</span>, however, could allow for drinking and clean water infrastructure investments to be coordinated with the expansion of electrical capacity required to support them. Or it <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">could arrange for channel deepening at ports to be planned alongside the bridge replacements required to ensure new and larger freight vessels can access harbors</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Bank experts would be able to actively seek out opportunities for cross-state and cross-sector cooperation, and encourage policymakers and private investors to undertake the kinds of visionary and integrated projects that are the most beneficial to economic growth</span>.¶ Finally, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">more efficiency-driven project selection could</span> possibly <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">deliver the greatest gains. An independent bank with a professional staff could rank project proposals by expected economic and social returns, and allot funds accordingly</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">They would not have to be constrained by outmoded formulas or arbitrary allocation processes, and could instead ensure that each dollar lent out achieves the greatest possible impact for the greatest number of people</span>. With funding for projects of all kinds becoming increasingly difficult to come by and with infrastructure needs growing daily, we cannot afford to continue being inefficient with our spending. A national infrastructure bank could help reduce such waste, while making the most of limited resources to effectively promote valuable economic, social, and environmental goals.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The creation of a national infrastructure bank would thus help increase public investment, attract private investment, improve investment coordination, and ensure investment efficiency</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">becomes more integrated into an increasingly competitive global economy, we have no choice but to pursue these goals, and we must do so with the greatest possible urgency</span>. Indeed, the idea of an infrastructure bank is not new to policymakers. (see box on following page)¶ A brief history of state infrastructure banks¶ The idea of establishing infrastructure banks to help finance needed investment is not new to the United States. As of 2010, 32 states and Puerto Rico already had state infrastructure banks in operation, using them to enter into more than 700 loan agreements worth $6.5 billion.24¶ A handful of banks were established in the 1990s as part of a limited federal pilot program, which was expanded in 2005 to include all states. Since then, most state infrastructure banks have been capitalized using a combination of federal and state funds, although a few have used only state monies to avoid certain federal regulations.¶ While these banks have helped finance hundreds of projects, their results have been somewhat mixed. Almost the entirety of the $6.5 billion allotted in loans comes from only eight states. South Carolina—one of the first participants in the bank pilot program and which raises significant additional funds by allowing its bank to sell bonds—is alone responsible for more than $3 billion of that investment. Many states have barely made use of their banks at all.25¶ Just as importantly, almost all of these banks provide funding only for surface-transportation projects, ignoring other critical types of infrastructure. Due to their relatively small size, they also do not have the funds or expertise necessary to handle regional megaprojects and generally avoid complex multimodal undertakings.26¶ State infrastructure banks will play an important role in meeting future infrastructure needs, but they would be more effective working alongside an equivalent federal institution. Such a national bank would be capable of taking on projects that state banks cannot and providing the expertise, coordination, and leadership currently lacking in our infrastructure-investment system.¶ National infrastructure planning council¶ While structuring financing packages for vital projects is among the most important roles the federal government plays in infrastructure investment, its activities extend well beyond this role and into research, issuing regulations, awarding grants, environmental protection, and even directly operating and maintaining locks, dams, bridges, and utilities throughout our country. To coordinate all of these activities and maximize the efficiency of federal infrastructure programs, we need a national infrastructure planning council. Such a council would unite the disparate federal initiatives currently attempting to individually tackle our national infrastructure crisis, thereby making the jobs of federal agencies easier and dramatically improving program effectiveness.¶ Such a council would help federal agencies establish a common understanding of the scope and breadth of the federal government’s investment in our nation’s infrastructure. By sharing current and pending project inventories, synergistic opportunities can more easily be identified and acted upon. Investments in locks and dams on¶ inland waterways could be coordinated with landside improvements at the seaports they service, while the impact of the information technology revolution on commuting patterns could be taken into consideration when allotting highway funding.¶ A national infrastructure council should also be tasked with collecting and disseminating best practices pertaining to project selection, preventative maintenance, and construction cost reduction. It would also promote the use of common objective measures to evaluate the progress of ongoing and completed infrastructure projects. The council would work to identify opportunities for innovation and help develop new mechanisms for leveraging private investment. A national infrastructure council would also work in close coordination with a national infrastructure bank, as the council could coordinate federal activities with nonfederal and private initiatives to ensure that the bank did not unnecessarily duplicate existing federal expert capacity.¶ With all relevant authorities sitting at a single table, we can finally develop and pursue coordinated approaches to overarching national problems such as road congestion and electrical grid reliability. A national infrastructure planning council would help the United States begin to close the gap between our level of investment and that of our international competitors—whose levels of infrastructure investment have surpassed that of the United States for years—and would help spur economic growth in both the short term and the long term.¶ What might a national infrastructure bank look like?¶ Multiple serious proposals for a national infrastructure bank have been put forward at the Congressional level in just the past five years, beginning with the bipartisan Dodd-Hagel National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007.27 More recent proposals include the 2011 Building and Upgrading Infrastructure for Long-Term Development, or BUILD Act, sponsored by Sens. Kerry, Hutchison, Warner, and Graham, and the National Infrastructure Development Bank Act, sponsored by Rep. DeLauro (D-CT). The BUILD Act also served as the basis for infrastructure bank proposals recently put forward by the Obama administration, including those found in the proposed American Jobs Act of 2011 and the president’s proposed 2013 federal budget.28¶ These various proposals share many common elements but also differ on several key institutional attributes. In this section we consider which features are almost certain to be incorporated into any future infrastructure bank, as well as components which still require significant attention from policymakers to ensure any proposed institution is as efficient and effective as possible.¶ The fundamentals of an infrastructure bank: Where most plans agree¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Most infrastructure bank proposals envision a wholly government-owned corporation led by a board selected by the president and subject to some form of congressional approval. Although the board’s size and composition vary among plans, all plans agree that rules must be put in place to ensure the board is not dominated by a single party’s partisan appointees and that its members have sufficient and relevant expertise in infrastructure development and financing. An important balance will also have to be struck between ensuring adequate oversight of the bank and enabling it to operate independent of political pressure, lest its project-selection process simply become another extension of existing, politically motivated allocation methods</span>.¶ The majority of proposals permit an infrastructure bank to offer long-term loans and loan guarantees of up to about 35 years, with the potential for flexible repayment schedules that would allow investors the time required to complete large-scale projects and begin recouping their costs via user fees, tolls, or other revenue sources. Entities eligible to receive financing would include state and local governments, private investors, or public-private partnerships. Eligible project areas vary somewhat between the plans but would almost certainly include energy, transportation, and water projects, possibly alongside environmental and telecommunications undertakings.¶ A successful example of such lending practices can be seen in the aforementioned Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation program. Over the past 14 years, this program has used $9.2 billion in federal funding to provide attractive long-term loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit that have leveraged more than $36.4 billion in private and public capital, helping undertake 27 major transportation projects across the nation.29 Among the reasons the program has been so successful is its ability to offer loans of up to 35 years and the flexibility of its repayment schedule. Recipients of this program’s loans can wait up to five years after substantial project completion to begin paying back their loans so as to allow time for facility construction and ramp-up.30 The designers of an infrastructure bank would be wise to use these elements of the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation program as a model.¶ To ensure that a future infrastructure bank accomplishes its goal of attracting significant additional nonfederal and private investment, a cap on the percentage of a project’s financing which can be covered by loans from the bank may also be required. The bipartisan BUILD Act proposal—as well as the most recent administration proposals—set this cap at 50 percent. This would ensure that the federal government never foots the majority of the bill for any project and maximizes the commitments of its public and private partners.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Importantly, most existing plans</span> also <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">avoid establishing specific criteria for project selection and leave this process up to the bank’s board. They do, however, emphasize that project selection should take into account </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">all economic, social, and environmental costs</span></em>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The board should also prioritize projects that lead to economic growth and job creation or are of particular national or regional importance</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If an infrastructure bank is properly structured and appropriate selection criteria are adopted, then it could not only help construct new and valuable national assets but also create thousands of jobs and promote environmentally sustainable development</span>.¶ An infrastructure bank proposal from Sens. John Rockefeller (D-WV) and Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) includes an even greater emphasis on breaking down modal silos in the Department of Transportation. The Rockefeller-Lautenberg proposal also includes a requirement for an infrastructure bank to consider the long-term fiscal and competitiveness impacts of their decision making. Some experts advocate including such proposals from the Democratic infrastructure bank bill in the larger bipartisan BUILD Act.31¶ Variability in bank plans: Important features still to be considered¶ There is a great deal of consensus about what should be included in the creation of an infrastructure bank. But there also is disagreement about certain components.¶ Among the first features of any potential infrastructure bank that remain open for consideration is whether or not a floor should be placed on the size of projects eligible for financing. The proposed BUILD Act and the president’s 2013 federal budget both mandate that estimated project costs be at least $100 million—or, in the BUILD Act, $25 million if the project is in a rural area—in order to receive bank support. The goals of such provisions include ensuring only large projects with substantial returns are financed and keeping bank funds away from smaller projects that could be capable of raising sufficient capital on their own.¶ Such limits, however, may also make it more difficult for the bank to take on the duties of smaller federal lending initiatives such as the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loan program or the Department of Energy’s 1703 and now-defunct 1705 loan programs. These programs support valuable investment in regional rail revitalization and clean energy technologies but generally make relatively small loans to individual companies or local governments. If cost floors exist, policymakers will have to carefully weigh the benefits of streamlining federal investment in infrastructure by assimilating such programs against the costs of cutting support for smaller but still valuable projects.¶ Second, architects of any future bank will have to determine how <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">administrative costs</span> will be covered. These <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">year-to-year costs could simply be taken from the funds used to initially capitalize the bank</span>, although this would diminish its lending authority over time. Yearly congressional appropriations could also be used, but this would then sacrifice the self-sustaining nature of the bank.¶ To circumvent these problems, the BUILD Act proposed allowing the bank to charge fees—such as application and transaction fees—or make interest rate adjustments to ensure a balanced bottom line. This would ensure the fiscal independence of the bank and avoid depleting its loanable funds, but it could make borrowing from the bank slightly less attractive. Regardless of the solution chosen, however, such costs will have to be planned for if the bank is to prove sustainable in the long term.¶ The bank’s ability to increase its pool of loanable funds by issuing bonds or borrowing on global capital markets is also of great importance. The DeLauro proposal includes provisions allowing the bank to do both with the goal of maximizing the amount of money the bank would have on hand to support critical investment. Some state infrastructure banks employ similar practices—including those in Florida and South Carolina—as does the European Investment Bank (described in the box above). But this practice requires attaching higher interest rates to loans issued by the bank since it must subsequently raise more funds to pay back bond buyers.32 Consequently, policymakers will have to evaluate whether the benefits of such debt issuance outweigh the potential for higher rates that could ward off borrowers.¶ Finally, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the size of the bank’s initial capitalization and whether it will be a permanent institution are both critical</span> and undecided issues. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A permanent institution could help ensure infrastructure investment does not again fall so far below required levels as it has in recent years and would help spur economic growth for decades instead of only in the near term. And if the bank is appropriately structured and fees set at a sufficient rate, then it could become an entirely self-sustaining entity that could operate for decades with virtually no need for additional federal funding</span>. The BUILD Act calls for a permanent bank to be established and capitalized with $10 billion. The DeLauro proposal, in contrast, calls for a temporary bank—to exist for only 15 years—but which would be capitalized with $5 billion annually from FY 2012 through FY 2016.¶ While these are still important features to be decided, there are a number of steps that can be taken to spur the establishment of a national infrastructure bank, as the next section explains.¶ Getting started¶ Neither a national infrastructure bank nor a national infrastructure plan will be created overnight. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there are a number of actions that can be undertaken immediately to move the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in the right direction</span>. In this section, we will detail the steps that should be taken by policymakers right now to help get these ideas off the ground and help get America’s infrastructure working again. Specifically:¶ •¶ Creating the national infrastructure planning council¶ •¶ Establishing a federal infrastructure bundling entity¶ •¶ Expanding and better utilizing existing federal loan programs in the short term¶ Let’s look at each step in turn.¶ Creating the national infrastructure planning council¶ We should immediately create a federal interagency planning council to ensure we develop a coordinated and comprehensive approach to national infrastructure investment as quickly as possible. The Center for American Progress recommends that the council include, at a minimum, the secretaries or their designees of the following departments, commissioners of the following agencies, and the directors of the following federal offices:¶ •¶ Department of Agriculture, Office Rural Development¶ •¶ Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service¶ •¶ Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers¶ •¶ Department of Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery and Reliability¶ •¶ Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation¶ •¶ Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration¶ •¶ Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration¶ •¶ Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration¶ •¶ Department of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration¶ •¶ Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration¶ •¶ Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water¶ •¶ Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Wastewater Management¶ •¶ Federal Communication Commission¶ •¶ Federal Emergency Management Agency¶ •¶ Federal Energy Regulatory Commission¶ Leadership will be critical to the council’s success. The president should select a knowledgeable and trusted neutral party to lead the council—someone who has experience in both infrastructure investment and interagency coordination. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">With such a council in place operating with the strong support of the executive branch, departments will be able to have a fuller understanding of each agency’s investments in the nation’s infrastructure and will be better able to identify and take advantage of opportunities for </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">interagency cooperation</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. This will help ensure the federal government makes the most efficient use of its limited resources and is able to strategically confront the challenges ahead</span>.¶ Establishing a federal infrastructure bundling entity¶ Given existing partisan gridlock in Congress and lawmakers’ hesitance to undertake large new projects, it may take some time to establish a national infrastructure bank. But in the meantime we can move toward establishing a bank while also yielding immediate benefits by creating a federal infrastructure bundling entity.¶ This body—which could be thought of as phase one of a national infrastructure bank—would provide intermediary services between public infrastructure projects and willing private investors but would not distribute loans or loan guarantees. It would identify large financeable projects and prepare them for pairing with interested partners, filling a critical void that is presently preventing millions of potential investment dollars from reaching critical projects due to a lack of viable investment options.¶ This bundling entity would be similar in function to the recently announced Chicago Infrastructure Trust but would operate on a national scale and concentrate on larger-scale and more complex projects. The estimated $1.7 billion in investment commitments the Chicago Infrastructure Trust already expects from investors such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citibank, Inc. demonstrates that a national bundling entity could produce immediate benefits.33¶ To ensure effectiveness, an infrastructure bundling entity should:¶ •¶ Be able to enter into contracts with experts in infrastructure finance, who can work directly with project sponsors¶ •¶ Be able to solicit projects for review and to work with federal agencies to explore creative options for bundling projects such that they may tap public loan programs, as well as private investors¶ •¶ Be required to seek out large-scale, financeable projects in every region of the nation¶ Creating an infrastructure bundling entity would by no means obviate the need for a full-strength infrastructure bank with lending authority, and it would not be able to leverage nearly as much investment. But a bundling entity would produce immediate benefits and help lawmakers recognize the beneficial role a full-fledged bank could provide. CAP recommends that Congress take action to create this entity as soon as possible and appropriate $10 million to fund its operation.¶ Expanding and better utilizing existing federal loan programs in the short term¶ While getting a national infrastructure bank off the ground may take time, there are still hundreds of vital projects throughout the country that need public debt financing. The recent allocation of $1.7 billion to the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation program over the next two years in the new surface transportation bill is certainly a significant step in the right direction but is insufficient on its own to meet national demand.¶ As a result, CAP recommends restoring the Department of Energy’s 1705 loan program, which invested $25 billion mostly in clean energy projects over two years before expiring in 2011.34 The program should be extended for another 10 years and enabled to support $4 billion in lending authority. This could mobilize up to $40 billion in additional investment, a CAP analysis found.35¶ Additionally, other underutilized loan programs should be encouraged to streamline their application and awards processes and utilize a greater percentage of their lending authority to put the highest rate of available funds to work. Of the nearly $124 billion available in FY 2010 for federal loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit, a recent CAP analysis found that only approximately $44 billion was actually disbursed.36 One particular example of such underutilization can be seen in¶ the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing program, which has only allocated a total of $1.3 billion in loans since its lending authority was extended to $35 billion in 2005.37¶ Certainly, accountability and good judgment in the allocation process must be maintained. In any given year it may not be feasible or responsible to disburse the entirety of the funds legally available. But there is significant room for improvement, and our existing system of infrastructure investment is far from tapping its full potential. By expanding and better utilizing existing federal loan programs, at least some progress can be made in repairing and modernizing America’s infrastructure before a national infrastructure bank is established.¶ Conclusion¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">For decades the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has categorically underinvested in its infrastructure</span>, and it should come as no surprise that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the consequences of this negligence are finally coming home to roost</span>. Locks and dams on inland waterways are falling apart. Commuters and businesses alike are losing billions of dollars on congested highways. And the nation’s electrical grids and drinking water systems are aging to the point of failure.¶ Meanwhile, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">our competitors in the global economy have only ramped up infrastructure investment and adopted ambitious national plans and targets</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If the U</span>nited <u>S</u>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is to remain internationally competitive, and our economy is to </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">return to its previous growth rates</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, then we have no choice but to repair and modernize our creaking infrastructure. Establishing a national infrastructure bank</span> and planning council <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">could </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">immediately</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> help accomplish these goals</span>.¶ To be sure, some commentators—including the Congressional Budget Office, in a recent report—express concerns that there may not be enough suitable projects for an infrastructure bank to finance, particularly in the realm of surface transportation. The same report also notes that surface transportation support through an infrastructure bank may ultimately be duplicative of existing federal loan and loan guarantee programs.38 But as we have established in this report, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">an infrastructure bank could have an enormous impact in planning and financing the kinds of large-scale, multimodal projects that create jobs and increase our economic competitiveness, but which struggle to attract federal funding or leverage sufficient private funds</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Rather than focusing solely on surface transportation—long a priority in congressional appropriations—a national infrastructure bank would ideally be able to finance complex investments that integrate transportation systems and enable our ports, rails, roads, and waterways to operate more efficiently. Moreover, such investments would leverage productivity gains throughout the economy</span> by better connecting improvements in related infrastructure sectors—energy and water infrastructure, for instance.¶ While the Congressional Budget Office report expresses concern that a sufficient pipeline of such projects may not exist in the short term, Robert Puentes of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program respectfully disagrees. In 2011 Brookings “challenged public and private leaders to send us their ideas for innovative, transformative investments. And the response was tremendous,” Puentes writes in The New Republic.39 He points out, rightly, that not every project would make sense for financing through a national infrastructure bank, but <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">creating a national bank </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">sends a clear signal</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to the private sector and the rest of the world that the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is making bigger, smarter choices about infrastructure. A national infrastructure bank is the missing link needed to connect private capital to the kinds of infrastructure megaprojects most needed to boost economic activity and competitiveness</span>.¶ Working in concert, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a national infrastructure bank</span> and planning council <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would help increase and coordinate public investment and ensure that federal dollars go only to deserving projects with substantial potential returns. By helping bridge the gap between private investors and critical infrastructure projects, these institutions could also attract billions of dollars in additional investments and help get promising but complex projects off the drawing board. It is time to stop wasting taxpayer dollars on a system characterized by inefficient formulas and disconnected decision making. It is time to finally create institutions capable of providing Americans with the infrastructure they need to compete, create jobs, and innovate</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Establishing a national infrastructure bank</span> and national infrastructure planning council <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">makes economic sense and offers taxpayers the opportunity to multiply a relatively modest investment into massive and meaningful gains nationwide</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Only by investing today can we hope to improve our prospects for tomorrow, and only by establishing such institutions can we ensure that our investment achieves its maximum potential. The stakes are simply too high to accept the status quo, and it is past time for us to stop neglecting the very foundation of our economy</span>.<br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Today, economic and fiscal trends pose the most severe long-term threat to the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates’ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">position as global leader. While the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">suffers from fiscal imbalances and low economic growth, the economies of rival powers are developing rapidly. The continuation of these two trends could lead to a shift from American primacy toward a multi-polar global system, leading in turn to increased geopolitical rivalry and even war among the great powers</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The current recession is the result of a deep financial crisis, not a mere fluctuation in the business cycle. Recovery is likely to be protracted. The crisis was preceded by the buildup over two decades of enormous amounts of debt throughout the U.S. economy</span> — ultimately totaling almost 350 percent of GDP — <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the development of credit-fueled asset bubbles</span>, particularly in the housing sector. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">When the bubbles burst, huge amounts of wealth were destroyed, and unemployment rose to over 10 percent. The decline of tax revenues and massive countercyclical spending put the U.S. government on an unsustainable fiscal path</span>. Publicly held national debt rose from 38 to over 60 percent of GDP in three years. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Without faster economic growth and actions to reduce deficits, publicly held national debt is projected to reach dangerous proportions. If interest rates were to rise significantly, annual interest payments — which already are larger than the defense budget — would crowd out other spending or require substantial tax increases that would undercut economic growth. Even worse, if unanticipated events trigger what economists call a “sudden stop” in credit markets for U.S. debt, the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would be unable to roll over its outstanding obligations, precipitating a sovereign-debt crisis that would almost certainly compel a radical retrenchment of the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">internationally</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Such scenarios would reshape the international order</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It was the economic devastation of Britain and France during World War II, as well as the rise of other powers, that led both countries to relinquish their empires</span>. In the late 1960s, British leaders concluded that they lacked the economic capacity to maintain a presence “east of Suez.” <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Soviet economic weakness</span>, which crystallized under Gorbachev, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">contributed to their decisions to withdraw from Afghanistan, abandon Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, and allow the Soviet Union to fragment. If the U.S. debt problem goes critical, the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would be compelled to retrench, reducing its military spending and shedding international commitments</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">We face this domestic challenge while other major powers are experiencing rapid economic growth. Even though countries such as China, India, and Brazil have profound political, social, demographic, and economic problems, their economies are growing faster than ours, and this could alter the global distribution of power</span>. These trends could in the long term produce a multi-polar world. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If U.S. policymakers fail to act and other powers continue to grow, it is not a question of whether but when a new international order will emerge. The closing of the gap between the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and its rivals could intensify geopolitical competition among major powers, increase incentives for local powers to play major powers against one another, and undercut our will to preclude or respond to international crises because of the higher risk of escalation</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The stakes are high. In modern history, the longest period of peace among the great powers has been the era of U.S. leadership. By contrast, multi-polar systems have been unstable, with their competitive dynamics resulting in frequent crises and major wars among the great powers. Failures of multi-polar international systems produced both world wars</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">American retrenchment could have devastating consequences. Without an American security blanket, regional powers could rearm in an attempt to balance against emerging threats</span>. Under this scenario, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there would be a heightened possibility of arms races, miscalculation, or other crises spiraling into all-out conflict</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Alternatively, in seeking to accommodate the stronger powers, weaker powers may shift their geopolitical posture away from the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Either way, hostile states would be emboldened to make aggressive moves in their regions</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As rival powers rise, Asia in particular is likely to emerge as a zone of great-power competition</span>. Beijing’s economic rise has enabled a dramatic military buildup focused on acquisitions of naval, cruise, and ballistic missiles, long-range stealth aircraft, and anti-satellite capabilities. China’s strategic modernization is aimed, ultimately, at denying the United States access to the seas around China. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Even as cooperative economic ties in the region have grown, China’s expansive territorial claims — and provocative statements and actions following crises in Korea and incidents at sea — have roiled its relations with South Korea, Japan, India, and Southeast Asian states</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Still, the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is the most significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and aggression</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Given the risks, the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">must focus on restoring its economic and fiscal condition while checking and managing the rise of potential adversarial regional powers such as China</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While we face significant challenges, the U.S. economy still accounts for over 20 percent of the world’s GDP. American institutions — particularly those providing enforceable rule of law — set it apart from all the rising powers</span>. Social cohesion underwrites political stability. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">U.S. demographic trends are healthier than those of any other developed country. A culture of innovation, excellent institutions of higher education, and a vital sector of small and medium-sized enterprises propel the U.S. economy in ways difficult to quantify</span>. Historically, Americans have responded pragmatically, and sometimes through trial and error, to work our way through the kind of crisis that we face today. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The policy question is how to enhance economic growth and employment while cutting discretionary spending in the near term and curbing the growth of entitlement spending in the out years</span>. Republican members of Congress have outlined a plan. Several think tanks and commissions, including President Obama’s debt commission, have done so as well. Some consensus exists on measures to pare back the recent increases in domestic spending, restrain future growth in defense spending, and reform the tax code (by reducing tax expenditures while lowering individual and corporate rates). These are promising options. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The key remaining question is whether the president and leaders of both parties on Capitol Hill have the will to act and the skill to fashion bipartisan solutions</span>. Whether we take the needed actions is a choice, however difficult it might be. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is clearly within our capacity to put our economy on a better trajectory</span>. In garnering political support for cutbacks, the president and members of Congress should point not only to the domestic consequences of inaction — but also to the geopolitical implications. As the United States gets its economic and fiscal house in order, it should take steps to prevent a flare-up in Asia. The United States can do so by signaling that its domestic challenges will not impede its intentions to check Chinese expansionism. This can be done in cost-efficient ways. While China’s economic rise enables its military modernization and international assertiveness, it also frightens rival powers. The Obama administration has wisely moved to strengthen relations with allies and potential partners in the region but more can be done. Some Chinese policies encourage other parties to join with the United States, and the U.S. should not let these opportunities pass. China’s military assertiveness should enable security cooperation with countries on China’s periphery — particularly Japan, India, and Vietnam — in ways that complicate Beijing’s strategic calculus. China’s mercantilist policies and currency manipulation — which harm developing states both in East Asia and elsewhere — should be used to fashion a coalition in favor of a more balanced trade system. Since Beijing’s over-the-top reaction to the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese democracy activist alienated European leaders, highlighting human-rights questions would not only draw supporters from nearby countries but also embolden reformers within China. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Since the end of the Cold War, a stable economic and financial condition at home has enabled America to have an expansive role in the world. Today we can no longer take this for granted. Unless we get our economic house in order, there is a risk that domestic stagnation in combination with the rise of rival powers will undermine our ability to deal with growing international problems. Regional hegemons in Asia could seize the moment, leading the world toward a new, dangerous era of multi-polarity</span>.<br />

<br />
Wider Ramifications of an Enduring Global Financial Crisis The report’s 30,000 ft. lesson that historic changes in the global economic and financial landscape require corresponding shifts in foreign policy thinking, is, if anything, even more apt. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Artificial divisions between ‘‘economic’’ and ‘‘foreign’’ policy present a false dichotomy</span>. To whom one extends swap lines and how the IMF is recapitalized are as much foreign policy as economic decisions. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Several states openly hinge support for NATO and U.S. coalition efforts upon domestic economic conditions which in turn, they insist, is contingent on U.S. monetary and fiscal aid. Others blend the two with even greater calculation: China using its SWF to compel Costa Rica to disavow Taiwan, Russia resorting to military tactics to scare would be investors away from competing pipeline projects</span>. Economics as High Politics <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As markets prove truly global in reach and risk, as margins progressively thin, and states assume ever-more market presence, the fictional barriers between ‘‘economic’’ and ‘‘foreign’’ policy will be increasingly difficult, even dangerous, to maintain. Finance and markets are now high politics</span>. Mere days after the G-20 convened in Washington and promised to ‘‘refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade,’’ Brazil supported hikes in Mercosur common external tariffs on a range of goods, China tightened its dollar-peg and announced a new round of export tax-breaks, India levied a new duty on iron and steel manufactures, and Russian leaders increased auto import tariffs. Inability to hold ground on these old and familiar problems will exacerbate progress on new, arguably more difficult tasks such as managing stimulus efforts, coordinating their eventual drawdown, and not least, undertaking any meaningful financial regulation. Against these odds, and in face of untold consequences of failure, the price of admission onto the international high table, whether indeed the G-20 or some successor entity, must be more than aggregate GDP, and include increased responsibility for shouldering global burdens if new institutions are to be effective. Increased Potential for Global Conflict Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is likely to be the result of a number of intersecting and interlocking forces. With so many possible permutations of outcomes, each with ample opportunity for unintended consequences, there is a growing sense of insecurity. Even so, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">history may be more instructive than ever. While we continue to believe that the Great Depression is not likely to be repeated, the lessons to be drawn from that period include the harmful effects on fledgling democracies and multiethnic societies (think Central Europe in 1920s and 1930s) and on the sustainability of multilateral institutions (think League of Nations in the same period). There is no reason to think that this would not be true in the twenty-first as much as in the twentieth century. For that reason, the ways in which the potential for greater conflict could grow would seem to be even more apt in a constantly volatile economic environment as they would be if change would be steadier</span>. In surveying <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">those risks</span>, the report <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">stressed the likelihood that terrorism and nonproliferation will remain priorities even as resource issues move up on the international agenda. Terrorism’s appeal will decline if economic growth continues</span> in the Middle East and youth unemployment is reduced. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">For those terrorist groups that remain active</span> in 2025, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">however, the diffusion of technologies and scientific knowledge will place some of the world’s most dangerous capabilities within their reach</span>. Terrorist groups in 2025 will likely be a combination of descendants of long established groups—Inheriting organizational structures, command and control processes, and training procedures necessary to conduct sophisticated attacks—<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and newly emergent collections of the angry and disenfranchised that become self-radicalized, particularly in the absence of economic outlets that would become narrower in an economic downturn</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The most dangerous casualty of any economically-induced drawdown of U.S. military presence would almost certainly be the Middle East. Although Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is not inevitable, worries about a nuclear-armed Iran could lead states in the region to</span> develop new security arrangements with external powers, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">acquire additional weapons, and consider pursuing their own nuclear ambitions. It is not clear that the type of stable deterrent relationship that existed between the great powers for most of the Cold War would emerge naturally in the Middle East with a nuclear Iran. Episodes of low intensity conflict and terrorism taking place under a nuclear umbrella could lead to an unintended escalation and broader conflict</span> if clear red lines between those states involved are not well established. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The close proximity of potential nuclear rivals combined with underdeveloped surveillance capabilities and mobile dual-capable Iranian missile systems also will produce inherent difficulties in achieving reliable indications and warning of an impending nuclear attack. The lack of strategic depth in neighboring states like Israel, short warning and missile flight times, and uncertainty of Iranian intentions may place more focus on preemption rather than defense, potentially leading to escalating crises</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Types of conflict that the world continues to experience, such as over resources, could reemerge, particularly if protectionism grows and there is a resort to neo-mercantilist practices</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Perceptions of renewed energy scarcity will drive countries to take actions to assure their future access to energy supplies</span>. In the worst case, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">this could result in interstate conflicts</span> if <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">government leaders deem assured access to energy resources</span>, for example, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to be essential for maintaining domestic stability and the survival of their regime</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Even actions short of war, however, will have important geopolitical implications</span>. Maritime security concerns are providing a rationale for naval buildups and modernization efforts, such as China’s and India’s development of blue water naval capabilities. If the fiscal stimulus focus for these countries indeed turns inward, one of the most obvious funding targets may be military. Buildup of regional naval capabilities could lead to increased tensions, rivalries, and counterbalancing moves, but it also will create opportunities for multinational cooperation in protecting critical sea lanes. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">With water also becoming scarcer in Asia and the Middle East, cooperation to manage changing water resources is likely to be increasingly difficult both within and between states in a more dog-eat-dog world</span>. What Kind of World will 2025 Be? <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Perhaps more than lessons, history loves patterns. Despite widespread changes in the world today, there is little to suggest that the future will not resemble the past in several respects</span>. The report asserts that, under most scenarios, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the trend toward greater diffusion of authority and power that has been ongoing for a couple of decades is likely to accelerate because of the emergence of new global players, the worsening institutional deficit, potential growth in regional blocs, and enhanced strength of non-state actors and networks. The multiplicity of actors on the international scene could</span> either strengthen the international system, by filling gaps left by aging post-World War II institutions, or could <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">further fragment it and incapacitate international cooperation</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The diversity in both type and kind of actor raises the likelihood of fragmentation occurring over the next two decades, particularly given the wide array of transnational challenges facing the international community</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Because of their growing geopolitical and economic clout, the rising powers will enjoy a high degree of freedom</span> to customize their political and economic policies rather than fully adopting Western norms. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">They are also likely to cherish their policy freedom to maneuver, allowing others to carry the primary burden for dealing with terrorism, climate change, proliferation, energy security, and other system maintenance issues. Existing multilateral institutions, designed for a different geopolitical order, appear too rigid and cumbersome to undertake new missions, accommodate changing memberships, and augment their resources. Nongovernmental organizations</span> and philanthropic foundations, concentrating on specific issues, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">increasingly will populate the landscape but are unlikely to affect change in the absence of concerted efforts by multilateral institutions or governments</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Efforts at greater inclusiveness, to reflect the emergence of the newer powers, may make it harder for international organizations to tackle transnational challenges</span>. Respect for the dissenting views of member nations will continue to shape the agenda of organizations and limit the kinds of solutions that can be attempted. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">An ongoing financial crisis and prolonged recession would tilt the scales even further in the direction of a fragmented and dysfunctional international system with a heightened risk of conflict</span>. The report concluded that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the rising BRIC powers (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) seem averse to challenging the international system, as Germany and Japan did in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but this of course could change if their widespread hopes for greater prosperity become frustrated and the current benefits they derive from a globalizing world turn negative</span>.<br />

<br />
Two closely related, though distinct, theoretical arguments focus explicitly on the consequences for international politics of a shift in power between a dominant state and a rising power. In War and Change in World Politics, Robert <u>Gilpin suggested that</u> peace prevails when a dominant state’s capabilities enable it to ‘govern’ an international order that it has shaped. Over time, however, <u>as economic and technological diffusion proceeds</u> during eras of peace and development, <u>other states are empowered.</u> Moreover, the burdens of international governance drain and distract the reigning hegemon, and <u>challengers</u> eventually <u>emerge who seek to rewrite the rules of governance. As the power advantage of the</u> erstwhile <u>hegemon ebbs, it may become desperate enough to resort to</u> theultima ratio of international politics, <u>force, to forestall the</u> increasingly urgent <u>demands of a rising challenger</u>. Or <u>as the power of the challenger rises, it may be tempted to press its case with</u> threats to use <u>force. It is the rise and fall of the great powers that creates</u> the circumstances under which major wars, what Gilpin labels <u>‘hegemonic wars’,</u> break out.13 Gilpin’s argument logically encourages pessimism about the implications of a rising China. It leads to the expectation that international trade, investment, and technology transfer will result in a steady <u>diffusion of American economic power, benefit</u>ing the <u>rapidly developing states</u> of the world, including China. As <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the US</span> simultaneously scurries to put out the many brushfires that threaten its far-flung global interests (i.e., the classic problem of overextension), it <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will be unable to devote sufficient resources to maintain or restore its former advantage over emerging competitors like China</span>. <u>While the erosion of the</u> once clear <u>American advantage plays itself out, the US will find it ever more difficult to preserve the order</u> in Asia <u>that it created</u> during its era of preponderance<strong>.</strong> <u>The expectation is an increase in the likelihood for the use of force – either by a</u> Chinese <u>challenger</u> able to field a stronger military in support of its demands for greater influence over international arrangements in Asia<u>, or by a besieged American hegemon desperate to head off further decline</u>. <u>Among the trends that alarm</u> those who would look at Asia through the lens of Gilpin’s theory <u>are China’s expanding share of world trade and wealth</u>(much of it resulting from the gains made possible by the international economic order a dominant US established); <u>its acquisition of technology in key sectors</u> that have both civilian and military applications (e.g., information, communications, and electronics linked with to forestall, and the challenger becomes increasingly determined to realize the transition to a new international order whose contours it will define. the ‘revolution in military affairs’); and an expanding military burden for the US (as it copes with the challenges of its global war on terrorism and especially its struggle in Iraq) that limits the resources it can devote to preserving its interests in East Asia.14 Although similar to Gilpin’s work insofar as it emphasizes the importance of shifts in the capabilities of a dominant state and a rising challenger, the power-transition theory A. F. K. Organski and Jacek Kugler present in The War Ledger focuses more closely on the allegedly dangerous phenomenon of ‘crossover’– the point at which a dissatisfied challenger is about to overtake the established leading state.15 In such cases, <u>when the power gap narrows, the dominant state becomes increasingly desperate.</u> Though suggesting why a rising China may ultimately present grave dangers for international peace when its capabilities make it a peer competitor of America, Organski and Kugler’s <u>power-transition theory</u> is less clear about the dangers while a potential challenger still lags far behind and faces a difficult struggle to catch up. This clarification is important in thinking about the theory’s relevance to interpreting China’s rise because a broad consensus prevails among analysts that Chinese military capabilities are at a minimum two decades from putting it in a league with the US in Asia.16 Their theory, then, <u>points with alarm to trends in China’s growing wealth and power relative to the United States</u>, but <u>especially</u> looks ahead to what it sees as <u>the period of maximum danger – that time when a dissatisfied China could be in a position to overtake the US on dimensions believed crucial for assessing power. Reports</u> beginning in the mid-1990s that offered extrapolations <u>suggest</u>ing <u>China’s growth would give it the world’s largest</u> gross domestic product (<u>GDP</u> aggregate, not per capita) <u>sometime in the first</u> few <u>decades of the twentieth century</u> fed these sorts of concerns about a potentially dangerous challenge to American leadership in Asia.17 The huge gap between Chinese and American military capabilities (especially in terms of technological sophistication) has so far discouraged prediction of comparably disquieting trends on this dimension, but inklings of similar concerns may be reflected in occasionally alarmist reports about purchases of advanced Russian air and naval equipment, as well as concern that Chinese espionage may have undermined the American advantage in nuclear and missile technology, and speculation about the potential military purposes of China’s manned space program.18 Moreover, <u>because a dominant state may react to the prospect of a crossover and believe that it is wiser to embrace the logic of preventive war and act early to delay a transition while the task is more manageable</u>, Organski and Kugler’s <u>power-transition theory</u> also <u>provides grounds for concern about the period prior to the possible crossover.</u>19 pg. 647-650<br />

<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There are two sure signs a campaign is in trouble. The first is that it begins changing its strategy rapidly and erratically. The second is that it begins attacking its strategists fiercely and anonymously.¶ The Romney campaign is in trouble</span>.¶ First came the changes in strategy. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It went from doing everything possible to assure a “referendum” election to picking Paul Ryan as the vice presidential nominee and</span> going for a choice election. It went <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">from focusing relentlessly on the economy to cycling among welfare, Medicare and Libya. The latest ad is about manufacturing jobs in China</span>.¶ ¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Now we’re hearing the calls for a change in strategists</span>. On Sunday night, Politico published a 2,700-word piece mostly dedicated to giving “Romney aides, advisers and friends” space to knife Stuart Stevens, Mitt Romney’s top strategist. “I always have the impression Stuart must save his best stuff for meetings I’m not important enough to attend,” <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">one Romney campaign insider told Politico. “The campaign is filled with people who spend a lot of their time either avoiding him or resisting him</span>.”¶ ¶ Ouch.¶ ¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">On the presidential level, where everyone running campaigns is very, very good at their jobs, campaign infighting and incoherence tend to be the result of a candidate being behind in the polls, not the cause of it. Romney is behind and has been there for quite some time. According to the Real Clear Politics average of head-to-head polls, Romney hasn’t led the race since October 2011. The closest he came to a lead in the polls this year was during the Republican National Convention, when he managed to … tie Obama</span>.¶ ¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Romney is also behind in most election-forecasting models</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Political scientist James Campbell rounded up 13 of the most credible efforts to predict the election outcome: Romney trails in eight of them. He’s also behind in Nate Silver’s election model, the Princeton Election Consortium’s meta-analysis, Drew Linzer’s Votamatic model and the Wonkblog election model</span>.¶ ¶ But I didn’t realize quite how dire Romney’s situation was until I began reading “The Timeline of Presidential Elections: How Campaigns Do and Don’t Matter,” <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a new book from political scientists Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien</span>.¶ ¶ What Erikson and Wlezien did is rather remarkable: They <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">collected pretty much every publicly available poll conducted during the last 200 days of the past 15 presidential elections and then ran test after test on the data to see what we could say about the trajectory of presidential elections. Their results make Romney’s situation look very dire</span>.¶ ¶ For instance: <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The least-stable period of the campaign isn’t</span> early in the year or <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in the fall. It’s the summer. That’s because the conventions have a real and lasting effect on a campaign</span>.¶ ¶ “The party that gains pre- to post-convention on average improves by 5.2 percentage points as measured from our pre- and post-convention benchmarks,” write Erikson and Wlezien. “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">On average, the party that gains from before to after the conventions maintains its gain in the final week’s polls. In other words, its poll numbers do not fade but instead stay constant post-conventions to the final week</span>.”¶ ¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This year, it was the Democrats who made the biggest gains from before to after the conventions. Obama is leading by 3 percent in the Real Clear Politics average of polls, about double his lead before the Republican convention</span>. If that doesn’t fade by the end of the week or so — that is, if it proves to be a real lead rather than a post-convention bounce — then <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there’s simply no example in the past 15 elections of a candidate coming back from a post-convention deficit to win the popular vote</span>.¶ ¶ This is about the point where I’m supposed to write: That said, the race remains close, and the debates are coming soon. It’s still anyone’s game.¶ ¶ But the most surprising of Erikson and Wlezien’s results, and the most dispiriting for the Romney campaign, is that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">unlike the conventions, the debates don’t tend to matter</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There’s “a fairly strong degree of continuity from before to after the debates</span>,” they write. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">That’s true even when the trailing candidate is judged to have “won” the debates. “Voters seem to have little difficulty proclaiming one candidate the ‘winner’ of a debate and then voting for the opponent</span>,” Erikson and Wlezien say.¶ ¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Gallup agrees. The august polling firm reviewed the surveys it did before and after every televised presidential debate and concluded they “reveal few instances in which the debates may have had a substantive impact on election outcomes</span>. “¶ The Romney campaign tends to point to two elections to show how its candidate could win this thing. There’s 1980, when Jimmy Carter supposedly led Ronald Reagan until the debates, and 1988, when Michael Dukakis was leading by 13 points after his convention. In fact, Reagan led going into the 1980 debates. And although Dukakis’s convention bounce was indeed large, it was wiped out by Bush’s convention bounce, which put him back in the lead.¶ ¶ That’s not to say Romney couldn’t win the election. A 3 percent gap is not insurmountable. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we’re quickly approaching a point where his comeback would be unprecedented in modern presidential history. And if the Romney campaign begins to crack under the pressure, then that comeback becomes that much less likely</span>.<br />

Kondik 9-20 (Kyle Kondik, House Editor, Sabato’s Crystal Ball, “House Battle at Relative Standstill, but Watch Generic Ballot,” 9-20-2012, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1406:http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/house-battle-at-relative-standstill/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/house-battle-at-relative-standstill/" rel="nofollow">http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/house-battle-at-relative-standstill/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1406 -->)<br />
<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">After shuffling many of our House ratings, it’s pretty obvious that the race for the House remains locked in a battle of trench warfare, with little obvious movement on either side</span>. Given that the Republicans start from a position of great strength — Democrats need to net 25 seats to take control of the House — <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the GOP remains a heavy favorite to hold the lower chamber of Congress</span>.¶ ¶ Our new ratings show 195 safe seats for the Republicans and 156 safe seats for the Democrats, with 14 likely Republican seats and 13 likely Democratic seats. That leaves 23 leaning Republican and 20 leaning Democratic with 14 toss-ups. Only 57 of 435 seats — 13% — are in the leaning or toss-up categories.¶ ¶ Our last full House update projected a Democratic gain of six seats; this time, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we’re projecting a Democratic gain of four seats</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Given the nature of the House — where many races are likely to be close to the end and where reliable polling is relatively scant, compared to Senate or gubernatorial races — our projections are bound to change, perhaps dramatically, in the last seven weeks before the election. But the center of gravity in this race — two sides locked in a close contest — is clear, and it favors the Republicans</span>.¶ ¶ Parsing the generic ballot¶ ¶ Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Executive Director Robby Mook said a couple weeks ago that the race for the House was “in a neutral environment,” but that if the generic House ballot was at Democrats plus five points, “we have a good shot.” We think the Democratic advantage in the generic ballot would have to be higher, but this was a relatively clear-eyed — and, for Democrats, potentially off-message — assessment.¶ ¶ The generic House ballot, a polling question that asks whether a respondent plans to vote for the Republican or Democratic candidate in his or her local U.S. House race, is an imperfect but useful tool in measuring the direction of the House race.¶ ¶ Chart 1 shows the average generic ballot on Sept. 19 for the past five national elections. In 2006 and 2008, Democrats had already assumed a fairly big lead (six points or so), which was indicative of their sizable seat gains in those two cycles, and Republicans had also opened a slightly smaller lead at this point two years ago (4.5 points), which eventually ballooned into a 9.4 percentage point generic ballot edge in a year in which they picked up 63 House seats. Meanwhile, 2002 and 2004 saw smaller leads for Republicans and Democrats, respectively, at this point in those cycles; Republicans ended up making modest additions to their majorities those years.¶ ¶ Chart 1: House generic ballot and final results in recent House elections¶ ¶ Notes/Sources: For 2006-2010, the author used the RealClearPolitics average as reported on the website on Sept. 19 of those years. For 2002 and 2004, there was no running average on that date, so the author averaged the five polls taken before or through Sept. 19 to calculate the average. Popular House vote differentials are from Vital Statistics on American Politics 2011-2012. Years are shaded blue or red to indicate which party gained seats during those cycles.¶ ¶ Granted, the generic ballot is not exactly the most precise measure — as is clear from the chart, the final average is typically off by several points from the actual combined national House vote — <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">but Democrats have made some recent movement in the generic ballot, perhaps related to President Obama’s polling bump from his recent convention; they now lead by 2.2 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average</span> (the full trend for the year is available at that link; it kind of looks like a roller coaster, albeit one for little kids given the small range). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Other averages have the Democratic lead in the three-to-four-point range</span>.¶ ¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">How predictive is the total House vote of the number of seats won? Not perfect, but certainly more predictive than it used to be</span>.¶ ¶ In the 24 House elections held between the end of World War II up to the 1994 Republican Revolution (1946-1992), Democrats won an average of 52.6% of all votes cast in those House elections but captured 58.6% of the seats. Meanwhile, Republicans won 46.1% of votes cast but only 41.3% of the seats. So Democrats — probably in part because of the very Democratic Solid South — typically won more House seats than their performance in the total national House vote would merit, and Republicans won fewer.¶ ¶ After 1994 — when the Solid South accelerated its turn to the Republicans — that Democratic advantage went away, as demonstrated in Chart 2.¶ ¶ Chart 2: Comparing total House votes to number of seats won, before and after 1994 Republican Revolution¶ ¶ Source: Vital Statistics on American Politics 2011-2012¶ ¶ In the nine elections from 1994 to 2010, both Republicans and Democrats did slightly better than their overall vote would indicate, but Republicans won about two percentage points more total seats and Democrats won about one percentage point more (these numbers don’t add up to 100 because of rounding and votes for third party candidates).¶ ¶ While we don’t have a big sample size, it seems that the total House vote does tell us something about how many seats a party will hold after the election in this era. To be clear, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a 2.2 percentage point lead for the Democrats in the generic ballot at this point is not very meaningful, but if that number inches up a few more points points, that might foretell bigger gains</span>.¶ ¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Models confirm the conventional wisdom¶ </span>¶ Last week in the Crystal Ball, we showcased some <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">presidential forecasting models</span>. Taken <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">on average</span>, they <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">forecast a tiny two-party popular vote majority for the president (50.2% for Obama, and 49.8% for Romney). There are models for the House, too</span>.¶ ¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A model by</span> Crystal Ball contributor <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Jim Campbell of the University at Buffalo-SUNY shows a Democratic gain of close to 10 seats</span>. Campbell’s forecast is based on the net difference of the number of Democratic and Republican “seats in trouble.” These are seats in substantial jeopardy of being lost by a party. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Two forecasts are produced using the “seats in trouble” index, one also taking into account the number of seats Democrats currently hold and a second taking into account the president’s approval rating. The equations</span>, which will be fully explained in the October edition of PS: Political Science &amp; Politics, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">predict Democrats to gain about eight or nine seats</span>. ¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Another model</span>, published this week at the political science blog The Monkey Cage, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">showed Democrats gaining just one seat. It uses a combination of national factors and district-level statistics to makes its forecast</span> (more details are available at the link).¶ ¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While neither model precludes the possibility of a Democratic takeover, their overall conclusions are pretty similar — modest Democratic gains, but continued Republican control</span>. ¶ Rating changes: Going out on some limbs, and staying out on some others¶ ¶ It’s getting to be moving time in the House, and given that the Crystal Ball will not have any toss-ups by Election Day, we’re going to stick our neck out a little bit in some places, with the caveat that we might have to revisit these races later.¶ ¶ Chart 3: Crystal Ball House ratings changes¶ ¶ Rep. Brian Bilbray’s (R, CA-52) performance in the June primary was weak enough that he has been on watch all summer. While the race appears to be a dead heat at the moment, we think Democratic turnout should lift challenger Scott Peters — so we’re pushing this race in the leans Democratic direction.¶ ¶ We’re also comfortable enough now to upgrade the chances of Rep. Mark Critz (D, PA-12). His Western Pennsylvania district is challenging for Democrats, but this John Murtha protégé proved his mettle in a tough primary race against fellow Democrat Jason Altmire in the spring, and he survived two tough races in 2010. We’re giving the benefit of the doubt to 2010 Democratic survivors like Critz, when prudent.¶ ¶ Rep. David Cicilline (D, RI-1) is lucky to be running in a very Democratic district in a very Democratic state. While he’s not well-liked because of his time as mayor of Providence, Democrats — especially in much of New England — appear to be strongly coalescing around their president and their party. That should be enough to get Cicilline across the finish line, so we’re moving him to leans Democratic. The same thing goes for Rep. John Tierney (D, MA-6), who has suffered from bad publicity over his family’s legal troubles. We’re keeping him in the leans Democratic column even though he, like Cicilline, is a weak incumbent.¶ ¶ In Nevada, we’re tilting NV-3 to Rep. Joe Heck (R), where challenger and state Assembly Speaker John Oceguera (D) has run a widely-panned race. This is not because of a recent SurveyUSA poll that showed Heck up 13 points; that poll seems Republican-leaning and we don’t believe Heck is leading by that much, but nonetheless we are shifting his rating. Heck joins Reps. David Rivera (FL-26), Allen West (FL-18) and Dan Benishek (MI-1) as highly tenuous Republican House favorites in our ratings.¶ ¶ Meanwhile, there are a few other races that we’re moving into the toss-up column. Rep. Mike McIntyre (D, NC-7) is the hardest target for Republicans in the redistricted Tar Heel State. If the GOP falls short of maximizing their gains there (three other Democratic-held seats are shaded in various hues of red in our ratings), it will be because the Blue Dog McIntyre hangs on. Rep. Mike Coffman (R, CO-6), meanwhile, saw his district become much more Democratic in redistricting, and he, like McIntyre, will try to hold on in unfavorable territory; Coffman’s district is a better target than that of Rep. Scott Tipton (R, CO-3), so we’re distinguishing the two by listing Coffman as a toss-up.¶ ¶ In Illinois, we’re sticking with lean/likely Democratic ratings for four Republican-held seats, but of those four vulnerable Republicans (Reps. Judy Biggert, Robert Dold, Bobby Schilling and Joe Walsh), only Walsh seems like a slam dunk for the Democrats. With toss-up IL-12 (held by retiring Democratic Rep. Jerry Costello) and leaning Republican IL-13 (held by retiring Rep. Tim Johnson), there’s plenty of action in the Land of Lincoln, with possible outcomes ranging from a net zero change in seats to Democrats netting five. Expect something closer to the latter (our ratings currently reflect a perhaps-too-rosy net plus-four for Democrats there, assuming they hold IL-12). One person who disagrees with our ratings? None other than Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) — he believes Tammy Duckworth (D) will defeat Walsh and that Bill Enyart (D) will hold IL-12, but that the others are “toss-ups.” We may end up agreeing with him as Election Day grows nearer.¶ ¶ Two seats moving off our list are AR-1 and NM-1, which are recent battleground seats in states that are trending blue (NM) and red (AR). Another is Rep. Pat Meehan’s (R, PA-7) seat; in a state where they lost five net seats in 2012, Democrats really only have one viable pickup opportunity: Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R, PA-8), who was elected for the first time in 2004, lost in 2006, and regained his seat in 2010.¶ ¶ Several Democratic-leaning seats get bluer in these ratings; one, however, is coming onto the list: National Republican Congressional Committee Executive Director Guy Harrison’s pet project this cycle seems to be defeating Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D, CO-7), who is facing Republican Joe Coors (brother Pete lost a Senate race to Democrat Ken Salazar in 2004). Coors, a member of the brewing family, has tons of money to spend, and Democrats were sufficiently spooked that the House Majority PAC, a SuperPAC that supports Democratic House campaigns, spent $500,000 there on ads, as has labor. Perlmutter remains a heavy favorite, but the race belongs on the list of competitive contests.¶ ¶ Reps. Michele Bachmann (R, MN-6) and Kristi Noem (R, SD-AL) also return to our list of competitive races, but we’d be surprised if either lost. Bachmann has certainly said enough outrageous things over the years to be in trouble, but she occupies the most Republican district in Minnesota. At first blush, saying “the most Republican district in Minnesota” may bring to mind William F. Buckley’s idea of a backhanded compliment (“the tallest building in Wichita, Kansas”), but Bachmann’s district only gave President Obama 43% of the vote in 2008, or 11 percentage points less than the state as a whole. Bachmann will always be a target, but it will take a Herculean effort to unseat her; Democratic businessman Jim Graves is giving it a go this time around, and his internal polling shows him close to the former presidential candidate.¶ ¶ Conclusion¶ ¶ As our House race charts show below, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there are dozens of competitive races for the House, and many of them will be difficult to call, even right before Election Day. However, there is little indication that the majority of the closest races — the leaners and the toss-ups — are strongly moving in one direction or the other</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A closely contested House race, with no wave building for one side or the other, is by default a good position for the incumbent party</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But</span> watch the generic ballot; <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if races start moving to Democrats en masse, the trend will probably pop up</span> in that number.<br />

President Barack <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>Obama can lose to</strong></span> likely challenger Mitt <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>Romney if he sticks with his we've-come-this-far campaign message</strong>, says economist and former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>The economy is recovering but not fast enough to prevent voters from blowing off Obama's stick-with-me promises in favor of Romney's I'll-do-it-better stumps</strong></span>. &quot;The Obama White House should face it: <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">'We’re on the right track' isn’t sufficient. <strong>The President has to offer the nation</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">a clear, bold strategy for boosting the economy</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>. It should be</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">the economic mandate for his second term</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">,&quot;</span> Reich writes in his blog. Editor's Note: <em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">For Obama to win</span></em>, he needs to base his campaign on four points, according to Reich, who served in three national administrations and was a secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton. First, Obama should demand that the nation’s banks modify mortgages of struggling homeowners and threaten to bring the Glass-Steagall Act if banks don't go along. The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act under President Clinton allowed banks to offer both retail and investment banking services. Second, he needs to do more to fight oil speculators than he is already doing, and third, <em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">he needs to push through more job-creating investments in</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">infrastructure by renewing his call for an infrastructure bank and put job-creating top priority over fiscal austerity</span></em>.

That’s why the Buffett rule, setting a minimum tax rate for millionaires, is just a first step for ensuring that the gains from growth are widely shared,&quot; says Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley. Obama's Buffett Rule, which slaps a 30 percent minimum tax on those earning at least $1 million annually and named after legendary investor Warren Buffett who championed the idea, failed to push through in the Senate.<br />

Taken as a whole, the set of special elections might suggest that races for the House could be more localized and idiosyncratic than in 2006, 2008 or 2010, rather than there being a wave in either direction. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The Democrats need to gain a net of 25 seats to take control of the House, probably more than they could realize just by happening to win a lot of coin flips at the district-by-district level</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">So where does the Democrats’ upside case come from? There is always the statistical probability that the economy will grow by a faster-than-expected rate in the second half of the year</span>. Economists expect the economy to grow by about 2.3 percent over the next two quarters. But economic forecasting is an extremely rough science and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">“surprising” results occur more often</span> (and both to the upside and the downside) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">than forecasters might like to acknowledge. We could be back in a recession by the end of the year, or we could be creating 200,000 jobs per month</span>. Even the economic upside case, however, would not be an unambiguous good <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">for Democratic Congressional candidates. It would likely help</span> President Obama, and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in presidential election years, a large number of people do not pay much attention to House races, enabling the winning presidential candidate to have some coattails down the ballot</span>. Apart from these coattail effects, though, the impact of economic performance is rather ambiguous in races for the Congress when control of government is divided. There is an entirely credible theory that if voters are happier, they may be more inclined to retain the status quo, which in this case means a Democratic president and a Republican House. It may be noteworthy that at the same time that Barack Obama’s approval ratings were improving somewhat in the first three months of this year, mostly as a result of slightly improved economic confidence, the generic Congressional ballot seemed to be getting more favorable for Republicans rather than Democrats. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">I would certainly think Democratic candidates for the House would prefer a better economy on balance</span>, but it is not a slam dunk. Instead, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the numbers that would leave me at least a little bit worried if I were a Republican incumbent are the extremely low Congressional approval ratings, which are hovering at about 18 percent and which are improved only slightly from their lows after the debt-ceiling debate</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Historically, these numbers have seemed to have some predictive power: when Congressional approval has been lower, the amount of turnover in Congress has been higher</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Higher turnover could cut for incumbents of both parties. However, since Republicans have more incumbents in the House — and far more incumbents in competitive districts because they won almost all of them in 2010 — this could work to their disadvantage on balance</span>. (The same would not necessarily be true, importantly, in the Senate, where Democrats are defending more incumbent seats). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">House campaigns have not really begun yet — and voters do not tune into them until quite late in the cycle. It seems plausible that challenging candidates will find that they have the wind at their backs once these voters do begin to tune in</span>. In short, the signs so far are that Republican incumbents are holding up well enough in the House, and that there is not much of a wave breaking in either direction. But, it is quite early, and I do not think we have a keen sense yet of how anti-Congressional sentiment might translate into individual races. Betting markets give Democrats about 4-to-1 odds against re-claiming the House. This is not completely out of line, but I might take Democrats’ side of the bet just on the general principle of long uncertainty early in a political cycle.<br />

We can expect proposals in the coming weeks aiming for a domestic economic surge, putting Americans back to work. But Americans should be wary of four types of proposals: Ones not designed to kick in before a 2013 inaugural address. Ones not enjoying broad bipartisan support. Ones dramatically increasing public spending. Ones not finding ways of moving the sizable amounts of private capital now sitting on the sidelines into physical and social infrastructure, renewables, mining, oil and gas, etc. Politicians and Voters of All Stripes Support Public-Private Partnerships Disagreements obviously still exist. An example, though: U.S. Congresswoman Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), the Tea Party leader, champions the bipartisan public-private partnership bridge project linking Minnesota and Wisconsin, the St. Croix River Crossing, together with Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.), Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Senator Herb Kohl (D-Wis.), U.S. Representative Chip Cravaack (R-Minn.), U.S. Representative Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) and U.S. Ronald Kind (D-Wiss.). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>A recent Rockefeller Foundation survey found that 78 percent of all voters support increased public-private partnerships, including 85 percent of Republicans</strong>, 84 percent of conservatives, <strong>80 percent of Tea Party supporters</strong>, 79 percent of liberals, <strong>78 percent of democrats</strong>, 77 percent of moderates, <strong>73 percent of independents</strong>, <strong>80 percent of Midwesterners</strong>, <strong>79 percent of Southerners</strong>, <strong>79 percent of Northeasterns and 75 percent of Westerners</strong>. </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Across the board, a majority of each group favors a National Infrastructure Bank</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <strong>to move this private capital into projects</strong>.

Take Obama's success in killing bin Laden, add to it Bush's decision to wage a hugely expensive and unnecessary war in Iraq, and what emerges is indeed a somewhat altered political terrain. The Republican advantage in times of heightened national security concerns - a prominent feature of both Cold War America and America in the post-Sept. 11 era - has been substantially neutralized. (Not, of course, for the Republican right, for whom Democrats, Obama very much included, are weak on defense because they're Democrats. If the facts get in their way, counterfacts have to be invented, as they were in the Swiftboating of John Kerry.) But if Obama has neutralized the Republicans' traditional advantage in foreign and military policy, he also largely forfeited the Democrats' traditional advantage in domestic economic policy. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Unless Obama plans some changes in economic policy as swift and surprising as the bin Laden raid, </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Democrats will go into the 2012 election with an economy that shows few signs of recovery and with equally few proposals to make it better</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. They will be opposing Republican plans that would make the economy radically worse by imposing unsupportable health-care costs on seniors and slashing public-sector investments. But </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">the election will be more a referendum on Obama's stewardship of the economy</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <strong>than it will be on Republicans' economic nuttiness or Obama's national security achievements</strong></span> (unless, of course, America falls victim to another terrorist assault). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In the early months of his presidency, Obama and his economic advisers failed to gauge the extent to which homeowner debt would cripple the construction industry and overall purchasing, as well as the extent to which the globalization of America's major corporations and their markets would dictate that their hiring, when it resumed, would happen more overseas than at home</span>. Even if the president had assessed these trends more accurately, it's not clear he could have persuaded Congress to enact a public works program large and effective enough to take up the slack created by the domestic private sector's failure to expand. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>unless the president is willing to climb this hill now</strong></span> - at least <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>by making the case for</strong>, say, </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">a public infrastructure bank</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and for strategic public investments on a much larger scale than he has thus far - <strong>he goes into the election with</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">no real plan to help the economy</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. <strong>He'll have a significant record of achievement, including</strong> a close-to-<strong>universal health-care</strong> law <strong>and</strong> a new generation of <strong>regulations on</strong> our otherwise out-of-control <strong>banks</strong>. For their part, Republicans are still busy cooking up bad ideas he can run against. That, <strong>plus his national security bona fides and a second-rate Republican opponent, may be enough to secure him a second term</strong>. <strong>But unless Obama becomes as bold on the economy as he was in hunting down bin Laden, his campaign may not resemble Democratic campaigns of yore. Strong on defense. Not much to say on the economy</strong>. Obama (or is that McCain?) for president</span>.<br />

With a little under one year to go before the 2012 presidential election, next year’s battle looks increasingly competitive, with ongoing economic distress and a highly energized Republican base potentially neutralizing the incumbency advantage that President Barack Obama would traditionally hold. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>Obviously, much could change between now and then but</strong></span> at the outset of the election campaign <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>it is clear that two large forces will ultimately determine the outcome: the shifting demographic balance of the American electorate, and the objective reality and voter perception of the economy in key battleground states</strong>. The central questions of the election are thus fairly straightforward. Will the rising electorate of communities of color, the Millennial generation, professionals, single women, and seculars that pushed Obama to victory in 2008 be sufficient and mobilized enough to ensure his re-election in 2012? Or will the Republican Party and its presidential nominee capitalize on a struggling economy and greater mobilization from a conservative base that holds the president in deep disdain?</span> Regardless of the outcome, it is likely that American politics will remain highly contested and polarized for years to come. The electoral volatility seen from 2006 to 2010 suggests that the biggest issues in American politics—the role of government, the balance of public and market forces, taxation, and social welfare policies—remain contested in partisan terms. The financial crisis and the Great Recession have severely clouded the electoral picture, making it clear that 2008 marked only the potential for a new progressive alignment in American elections, rather than its consolidation. Given the job approval ratings of the president and economic indicators in key states (see Table 1 on next page), the 2012 election will likely be tighter than the 2008 election, perhaps more like 2004 or even the highly contested 2000 election. What strengths and weaknesses do President Obama and Democrats hold going into 2012? As we’ve previously argued in other CAP reports (see “New Progressive America,” “State of American Political Ideology, 2009” and “Demographic Change and the Future of the Parties”), the shifting demographic composition of the electorate—rising percentages of communities of color, single and highly educated women, Millennial generation voters, secular voters, and educated whites living in more urbanized states or more urbanized parts of states—clearly favors Democrats and has increased the relative strength of the party in national elections in recent years. In contrast, the Republican Party’s coalition of older, whiter, more rural, and evangelical voters is shrinking and becoming more geographically concentrated and less important to the overall political landscape of the country. These Democratic advantages emerged clearly in the 2008 presidential election. Barack Obama’s 53 percent popular vote represented the largest share any presidential candidate received in 20 years. Obama won 365 electoral votes and he carried all 18 states, plus the District of Columbia, that John Kerry won in 2004 (as did Al Gore in 2000 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996), plus nine states that Kerry lost: Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. By region, this pattern of Democratic victories helped to reduce core GOP strength in presidential elections to the Upper Mountain West, Great Plains states, and the South. Republicans also lost their political monopoly in the South as the three fast-growing “new south” states of Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida went Democratic in 2008. The Northeast, the Midwest (with the exception of Missouri), the Southwest (with the exception of Arizona), and the West were solidly controlled by the Democrats. Moreover, the states the GOP carried tended to be rural and lightly populated. Sixteen out of 28 states Obama carried had 10 or more electoral votes while just 4 of the 21 that John McCain carried had that many electoral votes. Obama also carried seven of the eight most populous states: California, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan. Only one of the eight most populous states—Texas—went for McCain. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>Even with</strong></span> these <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>long-term demographic strengths, Democratic weaknesses are manifest</strong>. <strong>Continuing economic distress among large segments of the American public, coupled with the perceived inability of the Obama administration’s policies to spark real recovery, has coalesced into</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">serious doubts about Democratic stewardship of the economy</span></em>. In August 2011, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Gallup reported record low public approval of President Obama’s handling of the economy, with barely one-quarter (26 percent) approving of the president’s performance on this key indicator. <strong>No president in the past 50 years has been re-elected with unemployment as high as it is today</strong>. <strong>Historically, administrations with unemployment problems have seen them mitigated with significant employment change ahead of an election</strong></span>. But given that the Congressional Budget Office is currently projecting unemployment to average 8.7 percent in 2012, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>that does not appear to be in the offing—unless</strong> of course <strong>there are</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">new measures to stimulate jobs and growth</span></em>. Such measures face difficult prospects given the stated position of House Republicans. What are the strengths and weaknesses of Republicans going into 2012? As the 2010 election highlights, Republicans continue to hold strong advantages when the voting electorate is older, more conservative, and less diverse than the overall population. Democrats suffered one of the largest electoral defeats on record last year, ceding control of the House of Representatives to the Republican Party after regaining the majority just four years earlier. Republicans gained 63 House seats in the 2010 election, overperforming by about 10 seats what would have been expected on the basis of the popular vote split—approximately 52 per- cent Republican to 45 percent Democratic. The Republican vote was efficiently distributed to produce Republican victories, especially in the Rust Belt states and in contested southern states such as Virginia and Florida. The Republican gain of 63 seats was the best post-World War II seat gain by either party in a midterm election, and only the third time a party gained more than 50 seats since then. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>Exit-poll data from 2010 showed that independent voters, white working-class voters, seniors, and men broke heavily against the Democrats</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">due to the economy</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. <strong>Similarly, turnout levels were also unusually low in communities of color and among young voters</strong>, and unusually high among seniors, whites, and conservatives, thus contributing to a more skewed midterm electorate</span>. The desire to unseat President Obama will likely produce a strong surge of Republican base voters in 2012. If this enthusiasm gap translates into a noticeably more conservative, GOP-leaning electorate than is typical in presidential elections, Republicans may be able to capture several of President Obama’s states from 2008. Republicans maintain ongoing weaknesses that will need to be addressed in order to maximize their chances in 2012. The party’s increasing alignment with its most conservative wing and the rising power of Tea Party values and positions within the GOP camp does not translate well to the larger electorate. Thus, the GOP’s ability to capitalize politically on the poor economy will be significantly reduced if their eventual presidential nominee is too closely associated with an extreme anti- statist platform that is hostile to aspects of government that Americans support or a social and cultural agenda outside of the mainstream of public opinion. And even with a possible advantage in voter enthusiasm, the base mobilization strategy employed successfully by President Bush’s campaign in 2004 will be difficult to replicate given demographic shifts since that election and concerns about GOP extremism among more moderate, independent, and nonideological Americans. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Heading into 2012, the primary strategic questions will be: Will President Obama withstand continued doubts about the economy and his approach to recovery? Will the president hold sufficient support among communities of color, educated whites, Millennials, single women, and seculars and avoid a catastrophic meltdown among white working-class voters? Conversely, will Republicans capture voter disenchantment on the economy and offer a credible economic alternative to the president? </span>Will they nominate a candidate who can appeal beyond their older, more conservative, white, evangelical base? Will Democratic apathy and Republican energy make the electorate much more conservative leaning than its underlying demographics would suggest? The remainder of this paper explores these questions in more detail by first examining the demographic and geographic trends that will matter most in 2012 and then exploring what implications these trends might have in terms of Democratic and Republican strategy for next year’s campaign. In brief, here are our key findings. On the national level, given solid, but not exceptional, performance among minority voters, Obama’s re-election depends on either holding his 2008 white college-graduate support, in which case he can survive a landslide defeat of 2010 proportions among white working-class voters, or holding his slippage among both groups to around 2004 levels, in which case he can still squeak out a victory. Conversely, <em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">if Republicans can cut</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <strong>significantly</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">into Obama’s</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <strong>white college-graduate</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">support</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <strong>and then replicate the landslide margins they achieved</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">among white working-class voters</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <strong>in 2010,</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">then they are likely to emerge victorious</span></em>.<br />

Former House Speaker Tip O’Neill famously remarked that all politics is local. But this year, it’s the rhetoric of John Edwards that rings truer--in assessing the House race landscape, there are indeed two Americas. President <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama believes the way to win a second term is by rallying elements of the party base, but House Democrats trying to take back the majority face the added burden of winning the votes of increasingly disillusioned white working-class voters</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">When looking at why Republicans are likely to retain their 25-seat majority</span>--The Cook Political Report now says the possibility that Republicans will gain seats is greater than the possibility Democrats will retake the majority--<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it’s worth keeping the demographic divide in mind</span>. Democrats are likely to run very competitively in suburban swing districts and regain a number of seats that they lost in 2010. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">House Republicans are still putting Democrats on the defensive in rural and working-class confines, threatening to pick up additional seats they didn’t win in the midterm wave</span>. Of The Cook Report’s 19 Republican-held seats ranked as toss-ups or leaning the Democrats’ way, at least 11 are in urban or suburban congressional districts. Of the 11 Democratic-held seats in play, most are working-class districts or contain significant rural populations. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Democrats are well positioned to pick up seats in the Chicago suburbs</span> (Reps. Joe Walsh/Robert Dold), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Denver</span> (Rep. Mike Coffman), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and around Las Vegas</span> (Rep. Joe Heck), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">but could give nearly as many seats back in areas spanning from working-class southwest Pennsylvania</span> (Rep. Mark Critz), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">coal-producing southern Illinois</span> (retiring Rep. Jerry Costello), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">rural Little Dixie</span> (retiring Rep. Dan Boren of Oklahoma) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the expansive countryside of upstate and western New York</span> (Reps. Bill Owens/Kathy Hochul). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This isn’t a trivial matter. If Democrats struggle to broaden their brand, they will need to thoroughly dominate in the Democratic-trending suburbs to win back control</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In 2010, the National Republican Congressional Committee focused on largely white, conservative districts held by veteran Democrats as the gateway to a majority, and succeeded beyond their expectations</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A GOP-dominated redistricting process and untimely retirements from Blue Dog members</span>, such as Boren and Rep. Heath Shuler, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">have offered up fresh opportunities to go on the offensive</span>. For a telltale sign of how far Democratic fortunes have fallen with working-class voters, just listen to Critz, who sounded like a Republican in rebuking President Obama after his Ohio jobs speech last week. “President Obama and others in Washington need to realize that we cannot spend our way to prosperity,” he said. As Thomas Edsall noted in The New York Times on Sunday, “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The correlation between support from working-class whites and Democratic victory suggests the party takes a great risk when it downplays the importance of this segment with the electorate</span>.” <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While the white working-class share of the vote is declining, it makes up a disproportionate share of voters in battleground House districts</span>. When Bill Clinton headed his party’s ticket in 1992, Democrats carried 52.7 percent of the white noncollege House vote; in 2010, that number plummeted to 34.7 percent. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">On the national level, </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Obama can get reelected even if he loses badly with working-class whites</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, thanks to the rapidly diversifying electorate. </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">But at the House level, Democrats will have trouble forging a majority without them</span></em>. Consider this: After redistricting, there are now an outright majority of 221 congressional districts with a Cook PVI rating of R+3 or greater. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The next Democratic House majority (if it occurs this decade) will have to be built on the backs of Democrats who hold an appeal well beyond the base</span>. That will be all the more difficult, thanks to an increasingly polarized Congress. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">That reality is making things difficult for Democrats to gain a net of 25 seats to regain the majority. On the top of Democratic target lists are vulnerable Republicans representing white working-class districts, such as Rust Belt freshmen</span> Reps. Bill Johnson and Jim Renacci (<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Ohio</span>), Sean Duffy (<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Wisconsin</span>), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and</span> Dan Benishek (<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Michigan</span>). Democrats believe the members’ votes for Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget give their opponents a potent line of attack on entitlements. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">complicating their prospects are Obama’s weak approval numbers</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, which in those districts are considerably worse than his middling national approval ratings</span>. Meanwhile, in the redistricting process, Republicans paid careful attention to shoring up the districts of vulnerable suburban Republicans, who regularly faced tough reelection campaigns. Members such as Reps. Steve Stivers (Columbus, Ohio), Steve Chabot (Cincinnati), Jim Gerlach (Philadelphia), Pat Meehan (Philadelphia), Daniel Webster (Orlando), and Kevin Yoder (Kansas City, Kan.) are now favored to win another term. The gains have largely offset the new opportunities Democrats have in California and Illinois. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>The Democrats’ challenge is amplified by Obama’s campaign strategy to design</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">policies appealing to elements of his base, but which offer diminishing returns to down-ballot Democrats</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. By ordering his administration to stop deporting illegal immigrants who came to the country as children, Obama illustrated the importance of mobilizing the Hispanic vote. But many </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Hispanic voters are gerrymandered into safe</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Democratic House </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">seats, making the congressional payoff less fruitful</span></em>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The president’s push to help college students pay off their loans was designed to help him get them to the polls, but most large </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">college campuses are in noncompetitive seats</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. And his support for </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">gay marriage</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> helped him with fundraising, but it </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">did little to move the Democratic needle in swing districts</span></em>. As the election draws closer, expect to see many Democratic candidates in working-class districts balance their loyalty to the president against the necessity of doing whatever it takes to win. Because <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">what’s good for the goose isn’t necessarily good for the gander</span>.<br />

Single-party control is the only way to break gridlock<br />

Even though the Democratic and Republican National Conventions are over a month away, there’s little doubt that the 2012 general election is already underway. Pundits are constantly talking about the latest polls, electoral math and the faults of each campaign. Yet in the midst of the breathless media coverage of the daily back-and-forth of the presidential campaign, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">political commentators aren’t emphasizing one very important detail: <strong>no matter who wins the presidential election, the gridlock that’s currently preventing</strong></span> pretty much <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>anything from getting done</strong> in Washington </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">will continue</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> — </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">or</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> even </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">worsen</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> — </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">unless one party gains control of the White House and</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> large </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">majorities in both houses of Congress</span></em>. The <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Republicans</span> in the 112th Congress <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are commonly blamed for Congress’ inability to get any meaningful legislation passed</span>. In an opinion piece for the Washington Post, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>congressional scholars</strong></span> Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>observed</strong>, “When one party moves this far from the mainstream, <strong>it makes it</strong> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">nearly impossibl</span></em><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">e</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <strong>for the political system to deal</strong> constructively <strong>with</strong> the country’s <strong>challenges</strong></span>.” This statement deserves some consideration because, as NPR noted in April, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>Mann and Ornstein</strong></span> “have been in Washington for more than 40 years — and they’re <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>renowned for their carefully nonpartisan positions</strong></span>.” Ornstein also <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">told</span> NPR that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">since</span> President <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama was inaugurated, “<strong>when we did get action, half the political process viewed it as illegitimate, tried to undermine its implementation and moved to repeal it</strong></span>.” For example, Congress holds many symbolic votes, which are a blatant waste of time and money. Their time — along with taxpayers’ dollars — should be spent on actually finding solutions to our country’s problems. Shortly after the Supreme Court ruled that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional, the Republican-controlled House voted to repeal the law, despite the fact that the Democrat-controlled Senate definitely wouldn’t repeal the law and that President Obama would veto the repeal if it actually passed both houses of Congress. It was the 33rd time the House tried to repeal all or parts of President Obama’s health care law. CBS News reported that these efforts have “taken up at least 80 hours on the House floor” and have cost taxpayers “a little under $50 million” total. No wonder Congress’ approval ratings are at historic lows. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>don’t expect these kinds of tactics to end if Democrats lose control of either</strong> the White House or the Senate. After nearly four years of relentless Republican obstruction</span>, I highly doubt the Democrats are going to conclude that it’s time to let the Republicans do whatever they want now that they control a majority of the governing bodies in Washington. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Democrats will instead do everything in their power to block Republican legislation from becoming law. As long as Democrats control <strong>the White House, the Senate or the House</strong>, the gridlock will continue</span>.<br />

That’s key to sustain foreign policy effectiveness – prevents multiple scenarios for escalating global instability and conflict<br />

Flournoy 9-4 (Michèle A. Flournoy, former undersecretary of defense for policy, “Sustaining American Leadership Abroad,” in A Symposium: Democratic Advice for Obama's Second Term, The Wall Street Journal, 9-4-2012, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444914904577619742199611900.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444914904577619742199611900.html</a>)<br />
<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In a second term</span>, President <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama should double down on the big national security bets he made in his first term</span>.¶ He should <em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">continue to pursue a policy of international engagement to sustain U.S. global leadership</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and strengthen our alliances and partnerships. From day one, this president understood that real leadership in the 21st century is about </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">catalyzing effective international action</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in response to shared challenges. He has exercised that leadership repeatedly, from</span> NATO's intervention in <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Libya to</span> the 49-nation coalition fighting alongside us in <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Afghanistan</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A re-elected President Obama should continue his laser-like focus on disrupting, dismantling and defeating al Qaeda and denying it safe haven in places like Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen</span>. From the raid that killed Osama bin Laden to continuing strikes, U.S. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">pressure has decimated al Qaeda's leadership, forcing them to focus more on their own survival than on plots against us. This strategy, along with building the capabilities of key counterterrorism partners</span> (such as Yemen, Pakistan and the Philippines) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and reducing the risk of &quot;loose WMD,&quot; should continue until al Qaeda no longer threatens America</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The president should also implement the transition and drawdown in Afghanistan as planned, while continuing to press for an inclusive, Afghan-led political process to end the conflict</span>. Although recent incidents involving Afghan trainees attacking their NATO trainers are certainly cause for concern, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">overall plans remain on track to transfer security responsibility to the Afghans in 2014 and bring more than a decade of war to a responsible end</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The president should continue his strategic rebalancing toward the Asian-Pacific region. No other part of the world will have more impact</span> on America's prosperity in the coming decades. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As the power dynamics in the region shift with the rise of China and India, the U.S. has a critical role to play in maintaining stability and underwriting an international order in which disputes are resolved without the use of force</span>, human rights are protected, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and trade and commerce flow freely</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Even as we focus more on Asia, the U.S. must remain fully engaged in the vital yet volatile Middle East in order to prevent Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons, safeguard Israel's security, and support long-term stability by encouraging the reforms that the people of the region deserve</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">To be successful, however, </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">he will need bipartisan cooperation from Congress</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. It is imperative that we move beyond the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">political paralysis</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that has fed a </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">false and dangerous narrative of U.S. decline</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> abroad and has kept our nation from making the investments necessary to accelerate job creation and economic growth. Ultimately, any president's ability to lead and to safeguard our national security will depend on our ability to forge a postelection consensus on a pragmatic way forward here at home</span>.<br />

<br />
Welcome to the future. What <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we are witnessing</span>, at G-20 meetings and elsewhere, is <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the emergence of </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">a leaderless world</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that is dangerously adrift</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Often foretold in books</span> such as Niall Ferguson’s Civilization: The West and the Rest, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the phenomenon is now occurring on the ground</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">And not just in the economic realm</span>: NATO’s recent intervention in Libya was the alliance’s first major military effort conceived and led by Europeans. Meanwhile, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">troops are leaving Iraq, the last large-scale unilateral exercise of American hard power that the world is likely to see for a long time, if ever again</span>. A campaign that began wishfully as “shock and awe,” a demonstration of America’s righteous might, had little impact abroad. (The Arab Spring took inspiration from a self-immolating fruit seller, not a democratically elected Iraqi parliament.) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">remains, technically, the world’s only superpower. But in the past decade</span>, we have spent trillions of dollars deploying this vast military superiority—and to what end? Neither Iraq nor Afghanistan offers a clear victory.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Mostly what has been achieved</span>, it seems, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is to expose our economic and military vulnerabilities</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The success of insurgents in both countries demystified U.S. power in the eyes of the world</span>. “Whatever Washington thought it wanted when it invaded Iraq in 2003, it was not the establishment of Shia religious parties with links to Iran in power in Baghdad,” wrote one British critic, Patrick Cockburn of The Independent, this month. “Similarly, in Afghanistan, a surge in U.S. troop numbers and the expenditure of $100 billion a year has not led to the defeat of 25,000 mostly untrained Taliban fighters,” he wrote. “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Great powers depend on a reputation for invincibility and are wise not to put this too often to the test</span>. The British Empire never quite recovered in the eyes of the world from the gargantuan effort it had to make to defeat a few tens of thousand Boer farmers.”¶ The problem is much bigger than the United States. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If Washington is </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">no longer the agenda-setter</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> it once was, can a leaderless world continue to enjoy peace and stability? Can the “international system” as we know it today survive</span> without its father in the driver’s seat? <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The question is as important for America’s future as, say, détente versus confrontation was during the Cold War, or isolationism versus engagement during the rise of fascism</span>. “I don’t know how this is going to play out over time,” says a senior U.S. official who helps direct the U.S. agenda at G-20 meetings. “The Europeans have quite adroitly used the relative international diminution of stature of the U.S. in this crisis as way to get themselves back in the driver’s seat.” But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Europe</span> has its own existential crisis, which means that it, too, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is unlikely to lead</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If history is any guide, a global system of open trade and peaceful relations cannot survive under such conditions</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Through most of recorded history, and in every region of the globe, an international power vacuum has meant a ruthless jostling for military might, empire- and alliance-building, and</span> sometimes <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">worse</span>. The fall of Rome ushered in the Dark Ages. The Congress of Vienna that imposed European order after the Napoleonic wars broke down in terrible conflicts by the late 19th century. The end of European empire precipitated World War I.¶ The G-20 was created in 1999 and ignored for a decade. It won a battlefield promotion during the financial crisis. ¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Some experts</span>, such as Princeton University’s John Ikenberry in his new book Liberal Leviathan, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">argue that institutions like the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">N</span>ations <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the W</span>orld <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">T</span>rade <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">O</span>rganization—<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the overall benefits of trade, democracy, and openness</span>—<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are now so well entrenched that the global system can prevail on its own</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In rebuttal, political “realists” cite the overnight demise of the pre-World War I era of globalization</span>, a halcyon period of free trade that had seemed almost as promising as today’s U.S.-designed system. The skeptics point to <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">catastrophically wrong predictions</span> like that of Norman Angell, whose 1911 book, The Great Illusion, argued <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that economic interdependence would prevent another major war</span>.¶ Indeed, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a similar breakdown of international order might already have occurred if Washington had reverted to its traditional isolationism after World War II</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A resurgent Japan might have become a nuclear power and competed against China</span> for regional hegemony. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Europe would have devolved into age-old wars and rivalries</span>. Lacking the annealing structure of the postwar Atlantic alliance, the Continent might never have achieved monetary union. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Russia would have bid for Eurasian dominance</span>, as it has since the 17th century. Most important of all, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the trading system</span>, which the United States virtually reinvented after World War II, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would almost certainly have broken down, killing globalization in its infancy, reinforcing all the above developments. A major war of some kind would have been much more likely—and, despite the nuclear era, it might not have remained cold</span>.¶ SIGNS OF DECAY¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Already signs are emerging that, absent American leadership, the seams are unraveling</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Recent G-20 outcomes have been close to incoherent</span>: The world’s major governments didn’t just fail to devise a coordinated strategy for avoiding double-dip recession. In Washington and European capitals, they have embraced policies (for varying domestic political reasons) that most economists argue are the opposite of what is needed. They are pursuing austerity, in other words, when the world needs a concerted stimulus. The 50-year effort to strengthen rules for open trade—so integral to global stability since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade began in 1947—is also badly adrift; the 10-year-old Doha Round of talks has been at an impasse since negotiations broke down in 2008.¶ In fact, the only real evidence of global economic coordination in recent months has come from unelected central bankers, as seen in the coordinated rate cut of early December. And while Europe’s economic troubles will probably have more impact than any other factor on America’s economic health (and on the 2012 presidential contest), senior U.S. economic officials have found that they possess just one voice among many—and not even a major one—trying to bring the 17 eurozone countries and 27 European Union nations to consensus.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">America also seems helpless to affect the outcome of the revolutions in Egypt, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen</span>. At first, these seemed consonant with the spread of democracy that Washington has always favored. But now, if any outside force is shaping events, it’s the autocratic and brutally repressive regime in Saudi Arabia. Why? Because U.S. and European actions are being guided, more and more, by the decisions of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League, both of which are ever more dominated by the Saudis. As columnist David Ignatius wrote recently in The Washington Post, “Saudi Arabia has increasingly replaced the United States as the key status quo power in the Middle East, a role that seems likely to expand even more in coming years as the Saudis boost their military and economic spending.” And a top Saudi prince recently told U.S. officials that Riyadh wouldn’t depend on U.S. security reassurance in the region, saying that the threat from Iran and Israel means that Saudi Arabia must consider building its own bomb. “They no longer trust us,” says a former senior U.S. official who visited the kingdom in December.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Russia, too, is in turmoil, and all the world can do is watch, wait, and hope</span>. Twenty years ago this Christmas, when the Soviet Union (more or less) peacefully disbanded, U.S. economic advisers almost immediately began dispensing advice on what was then called democratic transition, and the Russian elite listened eagerly. Now, nuclear Russia appears on the verge of another revolution, and Vladimir Putin is telling the United States to keep its nose out.¶ Most unnerving of all, perhaps, is the rising global role of <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">China</span>. Beijing <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">could choose to be a rogue power that routinely flouts trade rules, manipulates its currency, and steals intellectual property—leading to an ultimate breakdown of the global trading system</span>. U.S. officials for years have pressed Beijing to become a responsible “stakeholder,” but <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the Chinese may have no incentive to listen if that system’s very survival is in doubt</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">These problems will shape the world in which our grandchildren grow up</span>. Yes, the United States has no military rival, even on the horizon. Maybe, 50 years on, the world map won’t look very different. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It could be</span>, in other words, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a world of occasional wars and political flare-ups, but one where trade and international relations continue largely as they are, especially if the U</span>nited States and Europe stay on the same page. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Or, given today’s rudderless environment and current trends, it could also become a </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">much more violent</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, uncertain world with rival, duopolistic spheres of influence run by Washington and Beijing</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Or it could even become an ugly multipolar world dominated by “the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates of <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Europe,” Moscow, Washington, and Beijing</span>—<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">one where vicious mercantilist trade and occasional proxy wars (or something far worse) define the contest</span>.¶ THE ESSENTIAL NATION?¶ Great powers typically decline very slowly. It took years before the world realized that Great Britain was an imperial corpse in the mid-20th century, sapped of its strength by two world wars. In 1947, a quick passing of the baton took place. The United States would now fill Britain’s role and become the central, stabilizing power in the West. The rest of the world, perhaps, didn’t realize how lucky it was to have such an orderly and seamless handoff.¶ The Cold War also ended quietly (though many had expected a big bang). For four decades, two ideas of social and political organization waged a titanic battle with apocalypse at stake. Then—on Dec. 25, 1991—Mikhail Gorbachev officially handed over his powers to Boris Yeltsin, and the Soviet Union ended its existence. The United States became, by accession, the world’s “hyperpower,” as French Foreign Minister Hubert Védrine described it at the time, reaching rhetorically for some new level of awesomeness not quite covered by the term “superpower.”¶ The ensuing 20 years at first seemed a time of triumph for the United States. After all, it had so clearly outperformed the Soviets, outspent them, and exposed their system as an ideological and economic fraud. Washington did some things right: Coaxing most of the former Soviet bloc states and allies, and many East Asian nations, into the Western system. But we never developed a new strategy. We tried “democratic enlargement” (Bill Clinton), “assertive multilateralism” (Madeline Albright), “the Bush Doctrine” (don’t ask), and now Obama’s no-doctrine presidency.¶ Instead, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">this 20-year era has been a kind of lost generation of diplomacy and errant war—a time, mostly, of confusion. No one calls the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a hyperpower now. Given the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">paralyzed state of American politics</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">; the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">indefinite state of indebtedness</span></em> (especially to China); <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the “</span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">rise of the rest</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">,” especially China, India, and Brazil, this era is looking more like an interlude</span>. The British maintained their imperial power for two centuries through a savvy (and somewhat ruthless) system of taxes and colonization, but Americans spent recklessly in the service of ideology—both through supply-side-inspired tax cuts and neoconservative pretensions about the projection of American power—and we stopped paying attention to how we were financing it all. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Partly as a result, partly because they are enjoying their own success within the system, other nations have </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">stopped taking our advice very seriously</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. It’s not that the so-called Beijing consensus is replacing the Washington consensus. Instead, there simply is </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">no new consensus</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> out there</span>.¶ One problem we have in sketching out a future course is that no one has really done a good job of defining the present system—in other words, how deeply entrenched the international system is in our world, or how it might differ from the past.¶ Like Princeton’s Ikenberry, I have argued (in a 2003 book, At War With Ourselves: Why America Is Squandering Its Chance to Build a Better World) that the current network tying together markets, governments, and peoples is far broader and deeper than any of its predecessors, including what existed before World War I. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Today, for the first time ever, most of the world is democratic, and most nations embrace similar ideas of open-market capitalism</span>. In the security realm, the powers that could cause America the greatest headaches—China and Russia—are motivated to keep at least one foot inside the system because they’re both proud permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.¶ No country, not even would-be rogues such as Iran, has yet found a way around these iron operating laws: <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In order to be influential or powerful, a nation must be prosperous; in order to be prosperous, it must engage the international system of open trade</span> (rather than conquer territory, as it might once have done); <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and in order to engage, even countries with dramatically different political and social systems, like America and China, must act according to the set of norms governing trade and conflict</span> (if not yet, sadly, human rights). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There seems to be no other choice. So the system has an internal logic that should give it natural life outside of U.S. dominance</span>. As Obama put it on a trip to China in 2009, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the American and Chinese economies are so integrated that to disentangle them would mean a kind of “mutual assured destruction.”</span>¶ This is all to the good. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But many political scientists insist that </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">American global power remains the essential glue</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to this system</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Charles Kupchan, a former Clinton administration official teaching at Georgetown University, argues that it’s almost impossible to keep the rules of the world system intact without an enforcer that guarantees global security. Until now, that has been American hegemony, not least because the U.S. has used its military dominance to amass scores of allies around the world. But how supportive will those allies be at a time of waning U.S. power, with China and other rising nations buying their own influence?¶ Perhaps no better augury of this future world exists than the G-20 meetings</span>. The Group of 20 was created in 1999 by Europe and Canada and largely ignored for the next decade. But Beijing, which never wanted to join the U.S.-dominated G-8, found a home there because it seemed to be a more level field, with more natural allies among developing countries. “The formation of the G-20 is a Catch-22 of sorts, in the sense that the advanced industrialized nations had to enlarge the circle because the post-World War II order was anachronistic,” Kupchan says. “But when you’ve got 20 countries around the table, that’s a lot of cooks in the kitchen.”¶ Predictably, the G-20 has become a cacophonous convocation with no conclusion. For decades, American leaders at international gatherings have been first among equals. At the United Nations, NATO, and the WTO, Washington has usually enjoyed a baked-in-the-cake dominance, at least in setting the agenda. The president of the United States acted as a kind of informal president of the world—the quarterback of a sort of open-ended global game of nations and interest groups, whether the issue is free trade, geopolitics, or terrorism. This happens less and less. “It’s relatively hard to have a conversation,” the senior U.S. official says. “People take stylized positions that make it tougher to get a consensus agenda.”¶ But the G-20 won a battlefield promotion during the financial crisis of 2008, when government leaders elevated it by common consent to semiannual summit status—because it included China, South Korea, and other important creditor nations—and turned it into the world’s preeminent economic forum, eclipsing the G-8. This unwieldy group came of age amid U.S. weakness and culpability, with Wall Street as the chief culprit in the Great Recession. As a result, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">U.S. proposals have, if anything, gotten less attention because they emanate from Washington</span>. At Cannes, for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel quite publicly repudiated the Obama administration’s idea for putting hard bands around trade imbalances. “To set political limits on trade surpluses and deficits is neither economically justified nor politically appropriate,” she said—although a year later Merkel herself would propose, in an effort to save the euro, “political” limits on budgets of the E.U. nations. Not coincidentally, that plan appeared to emerge without any American input at all.¶ DARK FUTURE¶ Of course, some <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">prominent thinkers, including Obama, still dispute the idea of American decline</span>. Like every other president, he calls America the “greatest nation on earth” as blithely as he breathes. Europeans and many East Asians—especially those thinking about the rise of China—say that U.S. power is as essential as it has ever been. Some <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">longtime scholars of the international system, such as former Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg, say that the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has staying power</span>. “If you unpack it, the favorable views of the U.S. in Latin America are at historically high levels now,” he says. “Views of the United States in East Asia are extremely high. Views of the United States in Russia and Europe are extremely high, in historical terms.” Although it’s true that a deficit-hampered America is spending a huge amount on defense—more than the rest of the world combined—it may pose no problem. “Our share of global defense spending has risen, but it’s still a very minor share of [gross domestic product] so as long as the economy is growing,” Steinberg says. “The country has sustained dramatically higher defense spending than this. If we’re under 4 percent of GDP for defense spending, that’s sustainable over an indefinite period.”¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">So far, none of the major powers—the European Union, Japan, Russia, even China—has orchestrated a major military buildup in a bid for global power</span>. Scholars going back to Thucydides argue that economic power inevitably tries to convert to influence on the world stage. So theoretically, countries like China, Japan, and new hybrid structures like the E.U. should be trying to convert their economic strength into military and strategic power. They all occasionally make noises about doing so, but their defense spending has remained steady and, even in China, not terribly aggressive. All of this has helped the global system survive terrorist attacks (which didn’t provoke a clash of civilizations) and a slew of financial crises (which didn’t herald the return of protectionism).¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will find it extremely difficult to exercise its military dominance in the future, whether in counterinsurgency wars or more-traditional ones</span>. Inside the Pentagon, officials are debating how to handle the rise of China, and the focus is shifting from Army-led counterinsurgency toward an Air Force and Navy kind of war-fighting strategy called “AirSea Battle.” The United States is not likely to ever again be as dominant as it was during the brief period of “smart bombs,” when the world stood in awe: Long-range and precision missiles are being commoditized, and the Chinese are developing their own. U.S. strategists, in response, are refining a doctrine of “assured access” to East Asia that means Americans would have to take the fight, in a hypothetical war, farther and farther inland in China to prevent those long-range missiles from being used. But critics say that’s an impossible task, especially with the budget knife now hitting the Pentagon. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is a standoff that could leave the world, again, without a clear leader or even a stable balance of power</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Meanwhile, China is throwing its weight around Asia</span>, seeking to strong-arm Australia and Southeast Asian nations into alignment on geopolitical issues. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Russia bullies members of the old Soviet sphere</span> by punishing them with gas shutoffs or by supporting pro-Russian separatists inside their borders. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In the Middle East, U.S. power is declining more rapidly than in other places, inspiring countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, vying for influence with Israel, to develop their own nuclear weapons</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In an environment with no strong leadership on global trade and integration—where mistrust and new destabilizers such as cyberwarfare are rising—</span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">conflict is much more likely</span></em>.<br />

Our impact is reverse causal – effective leadership controls all conflict escalation<br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The unusual combination of vast power and </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">remarkable global acceptance of that power</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> is the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">main factor</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that has </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">deterred great-power war</span></em>. We are dazzled by <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">democratization, globalization, and interdependence</span>, and believe these are the new developments that have made our world so different. But these <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">trends have been ebbing and flowing for more than a century, and they have not prevented catastrophic wars in the past and cannot be relied upon in the future</span>. The much-vaunted democratic peace theory would be more persuasive if the great powers were, in fact, all democracies. It could explain why Germany and France have not gone to war, but it does not explain why China and Russia, two great-power autocracies, have yet to become involved in conflicts with other great powers. Economic interdependence did not prevent two world wars in the twentieth century, and even today great powers cannot be relied upon to base all decisions of peace and war on economic considerations. One could imagine China attacking an independence-minded Taiwan despite the possible economic consequences. The American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have not exactly been a boon to the American economy. Neither men nor nations live by bread alone. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Nationalism, honor, fear, and other human emotions, as well as calculations of power, shape the behavior of nations just as they shape the behavior of the people who inhabit nations</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The common view that there can be no wars for territory, because territory no longer matters in this digitalized age of economic interdependence, is also questionable. One only has to look at the military deployments of nations like China, Russia, India, and Pakistan to see that, to them, territory matters very much indeed</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">China insists that restoring and preserving its “territorial integrity”—including </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Tibet</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, Hong Kong, and </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Taiwan</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">—are a “core interest,” as is control of the mineral resources and shipping lanes of the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">South China Sea</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Wars have been fought</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, and </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">could be fought again</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, over the disputed border between India and China at </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Arunachal Pradesh</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, between India and Pakistan in </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Kashmir</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, and over the territorial boundaries of </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Georgia</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Russian claims to the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Crimea</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in Ukraine and in the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Arctic</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> will likely be subjects of dispute in the future</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The question of an independent Kurdistan embroils </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Iraq</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Turkey</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, and </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Syria</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in territorial disputes</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">And of course there is the territorial dispute between </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Israel</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Palestine</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, which has led to four wars in the past and may do so again</span>. Can we place our faith in nuclear weapons to keep the peace among great powers? There are those who think so, and some have even suggested arming all nations in the world with nuclear weapons as a way of guaranteeing world peace. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the “nuclear peace” would seem even less reliable than the “democratic peace.” It is possible to imagine two nuclear powers fighting a strictly conventional war</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In fact, it is precisely such a war that both China and the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are spending hundreds of billions of dollars preparing for. India and Pakistan daily prepare for conventional war over Kashmir, despite their nuclear arsenals</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, great powers fought many limited wars for limited ends without seeking each other’s annihilation</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Nor is the horror of nuclear weapons a sufficiently reliable guarantee against their use</span>. During the Cold War world leaders spoke more often about the possibility of nuclear war than we may care to remember. The revered George C. Marshall spoke of how important it was that the Soviets understand “that the United States would really use the atomic bomb against them in the event of war.”58 Near the end of the Korean War, Dwight Eisenhower explicitly warned the Chinese that he <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would</span> not be “limited by any world-wide gentleman’s agreement” regarding the use of nuclear weapons, and he commented to his own advisers that a large concentration of Chinese troops made “a good target for this type. And <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">peoples have become socialized to love peace and hate war, then the nations of the world would be systematically disarming. But they are not, only Europe is disarming. The U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">China, India, Russia and Japan as well as</span> lesser powers including <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Brazil, Iran and Turkey are still willing to pay large amounts of money to prepare themselves for war</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">What deters them from using those weapons against one another is not conscience or commerce but a distribution of power in the world that makes success highly unlikely</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Were the distribution of power to change, were there to be a genuine shift in the balance of power towards greater equality, then these great and rising powers might pursue more ambitious policies because war would be a more viable option</span>.
