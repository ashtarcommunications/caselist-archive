<span class="Underline">Despite recent investments, existing SSA capabilities continue to fall short of operational needs and space policy objectives</span>. In the past 5 fiscal years, while DOD continued its investments in SSA, it has not delivered significant new SSA capabilities to the warfighter as originally expected. Capabilities that were delivered served to sustain or modernize existing systems versus closing gaps. For example, DOD has extended the service lives of some sensors supporting SSA capabilities and has added additional processors and servers to the SSA’s command and control system’s computer, as well as adding analysts and operational personnel. However, Joint Functional Component Command for Space officials did not characterize these efforts as delivering significant increases in capability. <span class="Underline">DOD plans to begin delivering major new additions in capability in the coming 5 years, including the Air Force’s recently launched space-based sensor that is expected to appreciably enhance SSA</span>. However, it is too early to determine the extent to which these new capabilities or additions will address capability shortfalls. As described below, <span class="Underline">many of these efforts—those expected to provide the biggest gains in capability—have struggled or are struggling with cost, schedule, and performance challenges and face risks to meeting their acquisition goals, potentially exacerbating SSA capability shortfalls. </span>Two new SSA acquisition efforts are scheduled to begin product development within the next 2 years— Space Fence and JMS, which are described below, together with five other key efforts. JMS will be essential to providing and enhancing future space command and control and SSA capabilities, while Space Fence is to be the single largest SSA investment. <span class="Underline">The challenges and risks these programs face include the potential employment of immature critical technologies, program office staffing and skill shortages, complex integration tasks, the integration of data from numerous heterogeneous sources, </span>operations in a multiple security level environment (information assurance), <span class="Underline">not utilizing an incremental development approach, and overloading of DOD’s current space object tracking system with data from new sensor systems coming on line over the next 5 </span>years. Table 1 describes, in more detail, the status of SSA development efforts that are expected to deliver large gains in capability over the next 5 years and the challenges and risks they face.<br />

Cost and schedule: <span class="Underline">The on-orbit SSA sensing capability is being replaced by SBSS when it becomes operational, estimated for the end of May 2011. SBSS experienced a delay of over 3 years</span>—<span class="Underline">along with about a 163 percent cost increase</span>, from about $332 million at development start in 2003 to about $873 million. The SBSS program was restructured in 2006 after an independent review team found that the program’s original cost and schedule baseline was not executable; the assembly, integration, and test plan was risky; and the requirements were overstated. The restructure provided for increased funding and schedule margin; streamlined the assembly, integration, and test plan; and relaxed requirements. <span class="Underline">The SBSS program office attributes the causes of the schedule delay and cost increase that led to the restructure to technical requirements volatility</span> (including a change to a much more complex sensor design, which became the program’s largest cost driver); a late development contract award; and a change in the planned launch vehicle type (from a Delta II to a Minotaur IV) which required the program to fund the launch. Subsequent to the restructure, technical issues relating to the Minotaur IV caused additional delays. Data processing: The Air Force’s Joint Space Operations Center Mission System (described below) will need to be available to process all SBSS data. Description/status: The Air Force’s initial RAIDRS effort is to develop ground-based systems consisting of antennas and data processing equipment that are to rapidly detect and report electromagnetic interference attacks on DOD satellite communication assets in the C, X, and Ku radio frequency bands. The Air Force initiated the program in March 2005 with a development cost estimate of $226 million and initial operational capability estimated for 2008. Challenges: Cost and schedule: <span class="Underline">The program has undergone multiple rebaselines, the most recent in 2009, because of contract cost increases totaling about $78.5 million</span> and about 4 years of schedule growth. <span class="Underline">The RAIDRS program office attributes the cost increases and schedule delay to technical requirements and design instability; overly optimistic cost estimates; incorrect assumption of utilizing government-furnished antennas which proved nonviable and which required producing new antennas; and an inexperienced and substandard prime contractor.</span> Initial operational capability is estimated for fiscal year 2012 and a revised cost estimate was expected to be developed by August 2010. Performance: The most recent program rebaseline resulted in a simplified system: from nine systems— six fixed and three deployable—to five deployable systems. The program estimates the simplified system will satisfy 92 percent of the program requirements, with reduced simultaneous geolocation and detection capabilities; no off-line processing, test, and exercise functions; and reduced ultra high frequency (UHF) interference capabilities (the latter was a Key Performance Parameter (KPP) under the previous Capability Development Document (CDD) b —according to the program office, the CDD is being updated to revise the UHF requirement). Description/status: • The Air Force’s <span class="Underline">Space Fence</span> is to be a new system of ground-based phased-array radars costing potentially as much as $6.1 billion, according to the Air Force Electronic Systems Center (the product center responsible for acquiring Space Fence). Space Fence is intended to replace and expand coverage provided by the aging Air Force Space Surveillance System using higher radio frequencies to detect and track smaller Earth-orbiting objects. The system was to consist originally of up to three geographically dispersed radars (notionally located in Australia; Ascension Island, south Atlantic Ocean; or Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands); however, recent analysis shows that a three-site system may not provide adequate cost-benefit over a two-site system and, therefore, the Air Force considers the likelihood of a two-site solution is very high<span class="Underline">. Currently, the effort is in the technology development phase, where the Air Force is actively assessing trade-off options between system performance</span>—such as detection altitude and accuracy—and affordability. System development is scheduled to begin in June 2012, with the first Space Fence radar site providing initial operational capability by the end of fiscal year 2015, and the final site providing full capability by 2020. Challenges and risks: • Data processing: The primary program risk, according to the Electronic Systems Center, is that the new Joint Space Operations Center Mission System (described below) will need to be available to process Space Fence data, as the amount of data provided will result in an increase in uncued detection and tracking capacity from 10,000 to 100,000 objects. • Integration, information assurance: <span class="Underline">The Space Fence program office states other risks of the program include large-scale integration and calibration of radar arrays, scalability of the design for the digital beam former, c and development of information</span> assurance certification criteria. • Technology: <span class="Underline">All five critical Space Fence technologies identified by the program office are immature— </span>one at technology readiness level (TRL) 4 and four at TRL 5d —which increases risk to cost and schedule goals. <span class="Underline">Given that technology discovery cannot be scheduled, the immature technologies raise the risk of having to defer product development until these technologies become mature.</span> Although mature backup critical technologies exist which could be <span class="Underline">used if the primary technologies do not mature by the start of system development, all have potentially higher acquisition costs and in some cases, higher operating costs as well, according to the program office</span>. While the program has a critical technology maturity goal of TRL 6 prior to preliminary design review (which is in accordance with DOD’s acquisition policy), e our best practices work has shown technology development to TRL 7 could significantly reduce risk to meeting cost, schedule and performance goals. Description/status: • <span class="Underline">SST is a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) development</span> effort intended to demonstrate an advanced ground-based electro-optical telescope with a large focal plane array that is to be based at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The telescope is designed to have the ability to search quickly over a wide area and provide detection, tracking, and characterization of small-sized dimly lit objects in deep space that significantly exceeds current capabilities. Challenges and risks: • Schedule<span class="Underline">: The Air Force was originally expected to assume control over the SST in 2009. But this is not scheduled to happen until 2012 because of technical challenges</span>. The telescope is scheduled for first use in early calendar year 2011. A memorandum of agreement has been established with Air Force Space Command for the transition. escription/status: • The Air Force began the JMS acquisition effort in 2009 as part of a consolidation of several SSA-related development efforts that proceeded from earlier, problematic, space command and control replacement efforts begun over the past 3 decades. Under an effort initiated in 2000, called the Combatant Commanders’ Integrated Command and Control System program, <span class="Underline">the development of space-related capabilities—which was to be completed by fiscal year 2006—was deferred multiple times and eventually canceled because of unanticipated technical challenges and cost overruns</span> of efforts that were to precede the development of space capabilities. • <span class="Underline">JMS, </span>which DOD has categorized as a major automated information system, f is a new program that is to provide the Joint Functional Component Command for Space with an integrated, net-centric space command and control and SSA capability. In June 2010, the Air Force rescheduled development start for March 2011, a delay of about 6 months from the previous estimate, because the program had not completed and documented preparations required to proceed with development. JMS is to be deployed in a single increment with five releases beginning in fiscal year 2011, with final delivery in 2016. • JMS is essential to providing and enhancing SSA capabilities because the current space command and control capability relies on antiquated hardware and software that is becoming unsupportable, is fragmented across disparate systems, is not well-integrated, and is not capable of processing the increased amount of data being delivered by current and to be delivered by future SSA sensor systems. Without JMS, most SSA sensor data could not be readily used. Challenges and risks: • Acquisition approach: GAO’s best practices work has shown that large system projects divided into a series of smaller incremental acquisition efforts made on the basis of reliable analysis of estimated costs, expected benefits, and anticipated risks, permits informed investment decision making. However, the <span class="Underline">current JMS acquisition approach is not adopting an incremental approach, as exemplified by its plans to proceed without knowledge of all critical technologies</span> and deferral of other planning activities. <span class="Underline">This lack of knowledge could result in unanticipated costs and other programmatic risks to the acquisition effort</span>. First, although our best practices work and DOD guidance call for critical technologies to be identified and matured by development start, <span class="Underline">g the JMS program does not plan to identify and assess the maturity of all critical technologies by that time</span>. Instead, JMS plans are to identify and assess critical technologies prior to each release. <span class="Underline">Consequently, the program will not have assurance that the needed technologies will be mature when needed and that cost estimates</span>—based on the development of all five releases—are reliable. Second, the program is deferring detailed planning work on future releases which could further imperil its ability to meet requirements, such as the delivery of multiple security level information assurance capability, within cost and schedule goals. h • Data integration: JMS and DOD officials pointed to data integration issues as one of the top risks for the JMS program. More specifically, JMS will need to integrate data from numerous heterogeneous sources, many of which are not net-centric. To ensure the data from these sources are compatible, the Air Force is currently working to ensure these sources are net-centric before JMS is complete. • Integration and information assurance: <span class="Underline">A major challenge JMS faces is the planned system’s complexity – it will need to integrate multiple capabilities and services that the system is intended to provide. Furthermore, the program is expected to provide information at multiple classification levels, called a multiple security level environment. Identifying and carrying out the information assurance practices necessary to provide information at multiple classification levels is a challenge</span> because of the complexities involved with defining, certifying, and accrediting automated solutions for ensuring information is not accessible by unauthorized users. Air Force officials stated that they are not aware of any Air Force information technology systems that provide information at as many classification levels as JMS is intended to provide. • Technologies: Our best practices work has shown that maturing technology to TRL 7 prior to development start reduces risk to meeting cost, schedule, and performance goals. However, the JMS program plans to use technologies, such as service information exchange capabilities to allow applications to send data and information to other applications and servers, that only have been matured to TRL 6 or greater prior to the start of development for each release. Description/status: <span class="Underline">• The HUSIR effort</span> is to upgrade the existing X-band Haystack Imaging Radar, operated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory for the Air Force, by adding W-band capability and enhancing imaging resolution (from 25 cm to 1cm) to characterize smaller objects in low Earth orbit and add deep-space tracking capability. Challenges and risks: • Cost and schedule: HUSIR began development in July 2004 with an expected initial operational capability in fiscal year 2008. However, operations are currently scheduled to begin 4 years later in fiscal year 2012, and costs increased about 170 percent from $40.5 million to $109.7 million. According to the Air Force Electronic Systems Center which manages the program, <span class="Underline">cost and schedule slips are attributable to the subcontractor’s inadequate understanding of work scope and inadequate control of vendor costs. </span>The subcontractor was terminated, requiring significant rework of remaining designs and fabrication. New technical requirements were also added to the program scope. According to Electronic Systems Center documentation, Air Force oversight of Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory, the prime contractor for the effort, was increased and a traditional government program office was established. A new acquisition program baseline has yet to be approved. • Technical: The Electronic Systems Center states that the primary risks to the upgrade program include excessive aperture deformation over the 37-meter (about121 feet) diameter radar dish, inadequate antenna control system accuracy, and delays to the modification schedule (caused by, for example, welding inspection failures and associated rework). According to the Electronic Systems Center, various technical and process mitigation strategies are in place to manage these risks.<br />

<span class="Underline">Europe, Russia, China, Japan, and a handful of others have long been our cohabitants in space, and that trend is spreading as international cooperation and transnational commercial ventures provide means of access to non-traditional partners in other parts of the world such as Southeast Asia and Africa. Some of these state actors recognize our dependence on space and see potential strategic vulnerabilities. Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt Gen Michael Maples stated before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence recently that “several countries continue to develop capabilities that have the potential to threaten U.S. space assets, and some have already deployed systems with inherent anti-satellite capabilities.” 9 In an emphatic coincidence, China launched an anti-satellite missile that destroyed a Chinese Fengyun-1C weather satellite during a technology demonstration on the same day as Lt Gen Maples’ SSCI hearing. 10 Additionally, the 2001 Space Commission Report identified micro- and nanosatellites in the 100 kg down to 10 kg size range as a growing class of threats to our space assets. According to the report, such miniaturized platforms could be “placed on an interception course and programmed to home on a satellite…[to] fly alongside a target until commended to disrupt, disable, or destroy the target.” 11 So how can we detect these threats in advance? </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The existing Space Surveillance Network consisting of some 30 or so ground-based sensors around the world along with the orbiting Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) provides the vast majority of our SSA capability, a capability Gen Chilton emphasized earlier was limited to counting and cataloging space objects. Key coverage gaps include an inability to </span>adequately monitor and characterize events occurring out of view<span class="Underline"> of the ground sensors, weather-dependent optical viewing, a lack of high-</span>resolution signature and imagery data<span class="Underline"> particularly at geosynchronous orbits, 12 and a capability to perform high-fidelity wide-area searches for small objects. 13 According to Jeffrey Morris in Aviation Week, AFSPC’s future programs plan contains only one space-based SSA program over the next 25 years for timely coverage of high interest objects: an orbiting telescope known as the Space Based Surveillance System. 14 Even considering this additional SSA system, a capability gap clearly exists for handling the kinds of threats identified by Lt Gen Maples, the Space Commission, and a host of others.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Former Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Commander Gen Lance Lord (USAF Ret.) defined space situational awareness (SSA) in simple terms: “The foundation of Space Superiority is Space Situation Awareness, which means having a complete understanding of what is happening in space.” 1 What exactly does that mean? Gen Lord goes on to say in his 2005 article in High Frontier that “It is no longer sufficient to simply know where a satellite is in space. We must know what the satellite is capable of doing, what it is being used for and what it may be used for in the future.” 2 Today the United States has a tremendous investment in space in our military, intelligence, scientific, and commercial sectors. Our space capabilities greatly influence everything we do. However, one of our most important space vulnerabilities is our lack of persistent situational awareness of the space operational environment to ensure we have freedom of action. As AFSPC Commander Gen Kevin Chilton stated in a 2006 media roundtable event at Peterson AFB, “We have been really good in the past at counting what's up there and keeping track of what's up there…I maintain it's time that we move beyond cataloging…to be able to identify what's up there and understand what it's mission is and then ultimately determine intent.” 3 His vision is to gather this information sometime within an object’s first orbit. But what if we could do it in real time? What kind of persistent, responsive, and adaptable capability would we need? Consider the possibility of having eyes and ears on orbit where the events are unfolding. Under the auspices of the Air Command &amp; Staff College Blue Horizons program, the focus of this research is to address these questions with an eye toward the possible in the year 2025. Specifically, this paper offers the Distributed Real-time Awareness Global Network in Space, or DRAGNETS, an approach that departs from the traditional paradigm of large, specialized, one- or few-of-a-kind space-based surveillance satellites. Instead, consider an interconnected network of very small centimeter-scale “femtosat” satellites proliferated throughout a variety of orbital regimes, where each femtosat is a sensing node contributing to a greater common operational picture. In addition to providing indications and warning, these nodes can autonomously form clusters in the constellation with enhanced aggregate capabilities to collect more detailed information on objects or events of interest, sharing that information throughout the rest of the network and giving commanders in the space operational environment </span>immediate situational awareness<span class="Underline">. The idea of using clusters of small satellites in missions traditionally relegated to large, complex, monolithic spacecraft is not new. 4,5 What is unique about the DRAGNETS approach is the aggressive focus on miniaturization of the elements and their use in an adaptive, global SSA constellation. A brief description of the methodology and structure of the discussion will help frame the approach. </span><br />

In the decades since the space program first began, the United States has become more and more dependent on space across a broad spectrum of military, commercial, and civil applications. That dependence brings with it an inherent vulnerability, and recent evidence of the growing threat, combined with acknowledged gaps that exist in our ability to rapidly characterize and attribute attacks on our satellites results in a compelling need for a robust space situational awareness (SSA) capability. The Distributed Real-time Awareness Global Network in Space (DRAGNETS) is one solution that leverages the trend toward distributed, networked military capabilities that nanotechnology will enable within the next 20 years. The DRAGNETS approach uses distributed constellations of thousands of very small sugar cube-sized “femtosats” to maintain continual cognizance of the space environment. Current and future advances in nanotechnology will lead to substantial miniaturization of satellite functions and allow the Air Force to field flexible, adaptive, and responsive systems as part of an overall SSA architecture. In order to realize the DRAGNETS vision, the Air Force should plan phased investments leading to an operational assessment of a prototype DRAGNETS constellation at a technology readiness level of 7 by 2025. The end result will be a capability that, when integrated with existing ground and space-based SSA assets, provides Combatant Commanders and senior decision makers with the necessary awareness to preserve maximum flexibility in the use of US space capabilities.<br />

<span class="Underline">And, they fly in wolf packs </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Ziegler 7 (Dustin P. Ziegler, Major, USAF April 2007 “PERSISTENT SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS: DISTRIBUTED REAL-TIME AWARENESS GLOBAL NETWORK IN SPACE (DRAGNETS)” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/bh_ziegler.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/bh_ziegler.pdf</a>, Donnie)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">In the future, progress in nanotechnology may allow for the packaging of SSA capabilities into smaller and smaller satellites. This in turn will enable the establishment of vast constellations of low-earth and geosynchronous orbiting femtosats operating as interconnected sensing nodes on a network. As alluded to earlier, the term femtosat refers to spacecraft with dimensions of roughly a centimeter and less than one tenth of a kilogram. 15 These nodes can respond to objects of interest such as foreign satellites, co-orbital anti-satellite threats, or anomalous debris by “condensing” into localized groupings or clusters of femtosats to perform higher fidelity characterization while at the same time cueing other specialized SSA assets for further investigation. Such a network will provide </span>high temporal <span class="Underline">and </span>spatial resolution<span class="Underline"> situational awareness of the space environment to support a host of missions including space object surveillance and identification, debris field mapping, technical intelligence collection, and </span>space weather monitoring<span class="Underline">. The benefits of distributed networks of very small satellites extend beyond the missions they enable, however. At a conservative rough mass estimate of 10 g per femtosat, a constellation of 250,000 femtosats comprises the same launch mass as our medium class satellite. That constellation could place clusters of 10 femtosats spaced every 1.7 km at a 600 km low earth orbit (LEO) altitude. Alternately, the constellation could be constructed incrementally using excess launch vehicle capacity on military, intelligence, NASA, or commercial missions. Finally, replenishment and upgrade of the constellation capability could be accomplished simply by replacing individual femtosats or through wholesale replacement of clusters. The preceding discussion of the capabilities and advantages begs a more detailed look at the inner workings of the DRAGNETS concept. DRAGNETS consists of three principle elements by which the concept may be described: the femtosats themselves, the constellation, and the command and control, or C 2 . The femtosats can fly in ‘</span>wolf packs’<span class="Underline"> as needed in order to surround an object to investigate from multiple perspectives. Building from here, the femtosats and their clusters are part of a constellation operating in a particular orbital regime, perhaps a specific altitude at a given orbital inclination, with multiple constellations needed to cover the full spectrum of missions. The architecture would also require a small number of relay satellites necessary for forwarding data streams to the ground stations and command uploads back to the femtosats. Finally, the C 2 element includes the aforementioned relay satellites, the unmanned remote ground stations, and the manned ground control center where the constellation mission data and situational awareness information are reviewed. The focus now turns from the DRAGNETS elements as defined above to a notional concept of operations (CONOP) in the form of a vignette. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">The tech is there, the question is investment </span><br />
Zeigler 7<br />
It is clear from the foregoing discussion the femtosats’ performance in a DRAGNETS architecture will only be possible with significant advances in the technologies identified. But is there a concerted effort in the scientific community to move research in the right direction? And is the capital there to support the research? Perhaps global market trends in nanotechnology can shed light on these questions. Nanotechnology is not new. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been around as a known quantity for over 15 years, and their predecessors that go by exotic technical terms like “buckyballs” were identified two decades ago. However, it has only been in the last eight years or so that the concept has picked up tremendous momentum as a hot research area with much to promise across many fields. In his foreword to the book </em>Nano-Hype//, former Nanotechnology Senior Advisor to the National Science Foundation Dr. Mihail Roco underscored this point: “While nanotechnology may be oversold in the short-term in some areas, its overall implications seem to be underestimated in the long-term.”42 The Bush Administration recognized the growing potential for this class of technologies and its importance to a wide range of disciplines when it established the NNI in 2001. The purpose of the NNI was to facilitate public and private sector research and development into nanotechnologies.43 Two years later Congress enacted and President Bush signed Public Law 108-153, the “21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act” formally establishing a National Nanotechnology Program.44 In 2006, nanotechnology was featured in the 2006 State of the Union Address as a cornerstone focus area for the President’s American Competitiveness Initiative.45 And the United States has followed up its commitments with resources as well: since its inception in 2001, the NNI program funding has increased from $464M to over $1.3B in 2006.46 But the United States isn’t alone in its nanotech interests. In June 2005, Matthew Nordan from Lux Research Inc., one of the nanotechnology market’s most widely consulted analysis sources, testified before Congress that 2004 global nanotech expenditures topped $8.6B. Furthermore, he projected that “new, emerging nanotechnology applications will affect nearly every type of manufactured good over the next ten years, becoming incorporated into 15% of global manufacturing output totaling $2.6 trillion in 2014.”47 Nordan also explained before the Research Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science that US dominance of the field is giving way to more aggressive foreign investment. At present, the United States leads in absolute investment, nanotechnology-related patents issued, corporate research and development spending, and scientific publications, but now lags behind several other countries in total investment relative to purchasing power.48 An August 2005 article in Foreign Direct Investment magazine described strong US competition from European and Asian countries but also highlighted some signs of cooperation as well, such as recent research agreements between China’s Zhejiang University and California’s International Institute of Nanotechnology.49 All of these signs point to tremendous growth in the nanotechnology market in the coming decade—fertile ground indeed for the kinds of advances required to make DRAGNETS a reality. It is important to note, however, that progress in these breakthrough technologies comes with the requirement for due diligence with respect to environmental and public safety concerns surrounding them.<br />

<span class="Underline">First-strike instability is made worse by limitations in space situational awareness (SSA). While the United States enjoys better SSA than any other spacefaring nation, it is still dangerously limited. Not all satellites are monitored constantly, and only limited diagnostic and environmental monitoring capabilities exist even for those that are, making it difficult to diagnose causes of sudden satellite failure. Knowing this, adversaries might be tempted to attack satellites covertly, believing that uncertainty regarding the causes of failure would impede retribution, or perhaps even that attacks would be misdiagnosed as naturally occurring failures. Alternatively, a natural failure that occurs during a confrontation or conflict could lead operators or policymakers to assume that the satellite was attacked, prompting unjustified retribution and subsequent escalation of the crisis. This dangerous combination of continued </span>vulnerability<span class="Underline">, growing dependence, and limited SSA indicate that first-strike stability in space has diminished, and further indications suggest that the rate of erosion is accelerating. While the difficulty of attacking orbital assets remains a stabilizing factor, that factor is shrinking as an increasing number of states acquire capabilities to interrupt space services. Several states are now attempting to develop directed-energy weapons. One of them, Russia, also retains the co-orbital ASAT capability that the Soviet Union developed during the Cold War and has since sold GPS jammers to anyone with the funds to purchase them. As has been the case since the dawn of the space age, any state with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons has the basic components to field a crude but highly destructive ASAT weapon. 16 The proliferation of such threats is troubling, and anxieties have become more acute now that China has begun experimenting with directed-energy weapons and has demonstrated a capability to destroy satellites in low earth orbit (LEO) with a direct-ascent kinetic ASAT weapon. 17 Unfortunately, the infrastructure, policies, and attitudes that both enable and constrain U.S. space operations in the current environment are, in many ways, unchanged from when they were developed during the MAD-induced stability of the Cold War. This leaves the United States exposed to the risk of a surprise attack in space unless a deterrence regime can be developed to restore first-strike stability in that domain. 18 </span><br />

If such a clash were to compel Beijing to attack US space systems at the beginning of a war, the very prospect of such a ‘space Pearl Harbor’94 could, in turn, provoke the United States to contemplate pre-emptive attacks or horizontal escalation on the Chinese mainland. Such outcomes would be particularly likely in a conflict in the next decade, before Washington has the opportunity to invest fully in redundant space capabilities. Already, US Strategic Command officials have publicly signalled that conventionally armed Trident submarine- launched ballistic missiles would be appropriate weapons for executing the prompt strikes that might become necessary in such a contingency.95 Such attacks, even if employing only conventional warheads, on space launch sites, sensor nodes and command and control installations on the Chinese mainland could well be perceived as a precursor to an all-out war. It would be difficult for all sides to limit the intensification of such a conflict, even without the added complications of accidents and further misperception.96<br />

Second, deterrence by denial solves, if attacks are too hard no one will do it.<br />

A little further away, we can improve our space situational awareness, which is going to take a while, and improve our command and control for active measures, such as orbit adjustments or perhaps intercepting things that are on their way up to get us in higher orbits. We might also move toward a distributed architecture for our military support systems. What is interesting about this as well is not only that these things that are real defenses and don’t depend on the deterrent threat of punishment, but that they have also don’t put weapons in space nor do they invite warfare in space. We need space in order for warfare here on the ground, but we don’t particularly need warfare in space. So in sum, I am urging you to consider only the capability to deny someone the military incentive to strike our space assets. That is the defense option, a response to more of the risks that might initiate attacks and that provides more options for limiting the consequences if those attacks should happen. The defense of our military assets in space is possible without requiring miracles of technology. They are sustainable and effective, no matter what other governments or their constituent elements believe. The defenses provide options that we want if the attacks do come anyway. And if an attack is then seen as too difficult to blind or deafen us, then presumably opponents will seek options other than attacks on our satellites. Now if you want to say then that they are deterred, fine. They might be inhibited, dissuaded, discouraged, diverted – I don’t care. But if they get it wrong and they do try to attack us, we have something that we can do about it and we can survive. So our mantra in responding to those would threaten our space assets, I think, should be, in keeping with the latest campaign, “No, you can’t.” If you seek defense, I think deterrence will look after itself.<br />

Try and pursue a strategy of deterrence by denial. Deny the adversary the benefits of attacking your satellite systems by installing, whenever possible, passive defenses on satellites, such as hardening against electromagnetic pulse attacks, measures to make jamming more difficult, and ablative shielding to help satellites both withstand actual physical attacks and survive space debris impacts. Eventually, as individual threats become more defined, active defenses should also be seriously considered, although this will be much further in the future. In tandem with passive defenses, develop and accelerate programs for rapid launch of satellites to reconstitute lost systems and to bolster constellations in times of crisis. Also needed are spare satellites in storage here on earth that can be launched at short notice. While the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program is seeking to address these issues with the use of small satellites, efforts should also be made to speed up the time it takes to place larger satellites and more traditional systems that are being used in orbit. I suggest that we prioritize space situational awareness programs in order to build as quickly as possible a comprehensive picture of the space environment, something that we are severely lacking today. If policy makers and commanders possess the ability to differentiate between purposeful attacks and the hazards of the natural space environment, then the potential for misperception and miscalculation is dramatically reduced. Furthermore, effective deterrence is strengthened by the fact that space situational awareness could potentially indicate the nature and origins of any attempted attack on a satellite, something that would be very challenging given that there are many ways in which one can attack a satellite, including cyber.<br />

<span class="Underline">This matrix illustrates the linkages from mission to space environmental condition to system anomaly to warfighter impact from left to right. Ultimately, if we are completely ignorant of environmental stressing effects, the resulting potential warfighter impacts are described in the right hand column. For example, Comms-on-the-Move (OTM) is a capability provided by SATCOM. If space weather interferes with tactical SATCOM at certain times and the user has adequate warning, they can effectively plan for the disruption, switching to terrestrial communication or using more robust SATCOM. Another example is precision engagement. If the accuracy (Circular Error Probable or CEP) for certain GPS aided munitions is affected by space weather, the weapons planners need to know about it in order to more effectively plan for the type of weapon system to be employed—or they might delay the mission in order to avoid potential collateral damage. Still another example is satellite operations and the requirement to unambiguously determine the source of a spacecraft anomaly. For the warfighter, this is especially noticeable if the satellite in question is dedicated to their area of responsibility (AOR) for communications, navigation, weather, or missile warning. Having the ability to rapidly determine the source as environmental not only helps get the system back on line faster, it can also help distinguish from other sources such as hostile attack. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">In contrast to what intuition might tell us about the ‘vacuum of space’, the space environment presents a continual stream of energetic particles bombarding the upper atmosphere and more importantly our satellites above it. High energy free electrons can become embedded in spacecraft surfaces and components, leading to electrostatic discharges (sparks) in sensitive equipment. Even higher energy particles such as those from solar flares can cause single event upsets (SEU’s), manifesting as temporary or permanent component malfunctions. The extent to which a component is resistant to or shielded from these effects is its radiation hardness, and conventional techniques for hardening against energetic electrons and protons often involve shielding with aluminum or other absorbing materials. Since this approach is impractical in the DRAGNETS concept, it is worth exploring whether the properties of the nanocomponents themselves offer inherent radiation hardness. Nanotechnology may offer solutions to mitigate this problem. One approach cited by the Air Force Science and Technology Board involves the use of vacuum integrated circuits, a modern twist on yesterday’s vacuum tube. These devices operate by pulling current from a cathode by applying an electric field, a term known as field emission (if this sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because field emission is the basis of the FEEP thrusters discussed earlier). Nanomaterials can be used to make long-lasting cathodes for integrated circuits to operate in “extreme temperature and radiation environments.” 57 Another phenomenon working in our favor is the fact that QD and CNT-based devices are also remarkably radiation resistant. According to a paper published at the 2nd International Energy Conversion Engineering Conference in 2004, “QD/CNT-based photovoltaic devices have the potential to be as many as five orders of magnitude more resistant to radiation damage” than conventional electronic devices. 58 However, unless our satellite is made entirely of QD’s and vacuum microelectronics, there is still much to be done in the analysis of space radiation effects on nanoelectronics.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Cyber and space domains are contributing a tremendous measure of complexity to the challenge of deterring future adversaries. Deterrence and escalation control now cross multiple domains of war. Attacks against space assets intended to blind or dazzle for tactical or operational effect may be perceived as precursors to broader, deeper strategic attacks. Computer network attacks may have huge unintended consequences for the entire global system. And new conventional capabilities may have farreaching deterrent effects. In Europe, for example, while the United States and Russia argue over the role of ballistic missile defenses in our strategic relationship, some assert that the alliance can afford to trade off nonstrategic nuclear capabilities while deploying ballistic missile defenses. Also, there is an emerging debate on the deterrent value of conventionally armed intercontinental missiles that could fly a ballistic trajectory for part of their path and then shift to a more maneuverable mode during reentry. 9 Such complex escalation and deterrence relationships heighten the potential for misperceptions and increase the risks of unleashing </span>catalytic escalation forces<span class="Underline">. In this milieu, Herman Kahn’s ladder of escalation is less helpful as a mental model of deterrence. In a bipolar world, escalation was linear. Now, escalation can function across many dimensions not limited to the nuclear escalation ladder. In the multipolar, proliferated nuclear world, deterrence exists across at least four domains simultaneously—conventional, nuclear, cyber, and space. Dr. Chris Yeaw, Air Force Global Strike Command’s chief scientist, likened this to a vortex in which each side could escalate or deescalate simultaneously across multiple domains and even jump from one ladder to another, making crisis management and escalation control </span>much more complicated<span class="Underline">. </span><br />

These risks are compounded by the fact that every newly nuclear state goes through a period of learning about its new role; it must learn both how it intends to employ its nuclear capabilities to achieve their deterrent effects and how to keep them safe, secure, and reliable in their particular geopolitical environment.

<span class="Underline">Our overall goal should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. security. The U.S. has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies. These vital space assets face three forms of threats, all of them worrisome and growing: 1) With the proliferation of space and other technologies, and specifically with the anti-satellite (ASAT) capability China demonstrated two years ago, there is a risk that China or another adversary could exploit this fast-growing U.S. dependence on space in a war to greatly </span>weaken U.S. military<span class="Underline"> and economic </span>power<span class="Underline">. China could do so and thus pose a serious threat to U.S. space assets within a decade if it chose to do so. China is also pursuing other programs that have important ASAT implications, and other nations are interested in ASAT as well. The 2008 U.S. shoot-down of an errant satellite demonstrated the ASAT capability inherent to missile defense systems, ours and others. Last week Russia indicated renewed interest in ASAT weapons when their deputy defense minister, General Valentin Popovkin, stated that Russia is working on ASAT. 2) Space “traffic” is heavier than it has ever been and getting worse, both in terms of physical vehicles and communications. Yet there is no “</span>FAA for space<span class="Underline">” and even just the monitoring, much less the management, of space objects is widely seen as far less than needed. There is a great need for space traffic management capabilities, including enforceable rules of the road, codes of conduct, and space situational awareness that would inform a “space FAA” management capability. 3) Space debris poses an insidious and growing threat to all space assets. Debris in space does not quickly fall to the ground, as on earth; at all but the lowest orbits, debris can stay aloft for centuries and more. In addition to the 17,000 orbiting objects the Air Force can track, there are hundreds of thousands of potentially lethal objects in orbit, and millions of smaller objects that pose at least some risk. The recent collision between a U.S. Iridium satellite and an old Russian Cosmos dramatically illustrated the problem. Our space assets are exposed and fragile. They can’t run, they can’t hide, and today they can’t defend themselves. One small object traveling at orbital speeds can destroy them. Unless we take proactive measures, all these threats will grow, and we must bear in mind that the U.S. depends more on space than our potential adversaries. If we are not careful, the way we are currently thinking, planning, and investing, our space capabilities may only be available in peacetime, or against non-peer adversaries. We could lose them just when we need them most. At a minimum, we need far greater space situational awareness and space intelligence (SSA/SI) capabilities than today. Responsible officials have been saying this for years, but SSA/SI has never received the priority it deserves. If this fails to change, we can expect more frequent </span>space collisions<span class="Underline"> and </span>growing instability in space<span class="Underline">. I will focus on the hostile threat dimensions of our overall military space challenges, though orbital debris and space traffic management also deserve priority attention. </span><br />

Err aff on this question, China is weaponizing to counter US assests and propsed the PPWT as a trick to undermine us.<br />

The PRC understands the advantage the United States has with it space systems, and that they are critical to its military operations. The PRC also understands that the best way to counter this advantage is to deny the United States the use of its space systems. These open-source statements are not all-inclusive and raise the question of whether they actually reflect the true policy of the PRC. While it is difficult to rely solely on open source literature and commentary from the PRC as a persuasive warning that United States’ outer space systems are vulnerable, neither should they be idly be dismissed.4 PRC and the PPWT “With regard to precipitous heights, if you proceed your adversary, occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.” “…if the enemy has occupied precipitous heights before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.” The PRC white paper extols the PPWT jointly submitted with the Russian Federation as the means to achieve the PRC’s purported policy goal of preventing the weaponization of outer space. In an indirect reference to the PPWT, Cheng Jingye, director-general of the Department of Arms Control and Disarmament under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made a comment early in 2011 that references the policy enunciated in the PRC white paper. Cheng, doubtless referring to the PPWT, said that the negotiation and conclusion of a new international legal instrument to prevent an arms race in outer space is the best way to ensure outer space’s peace and security.5 The proffered purpose in the preamble of the PPWT6 by the Russian Federation and China is to address the deficiency of Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty.7 Article IV bans the placement of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in orbit of the earth, but it is silent concerning weapons that are non-nuclear or otherwise do not reach the destructive potential of a weapon of mass destruction. The PPWT offers the following definition of a space weapon: The term “weapon in outer space” means any device placed in outer space, based on any physical principle, which has been specially produced or converted to destroy, damage or disrupt the normal functioning of objects in outer space, on the Earth or in the Earth’s atmosphere, or to eliminate a population or components of the biosphere which are important to human existence or inflict damage on them; The PPWT goes on to say that: A weapon shall be considered to have been “placed” in outer space if it orbits the Earth at least once, or follows a section of such an orbit before leaving this orbit, or is permanently located somewhere in outer space; The PPWT then defines the “use of force” or the threat of “use of force” as: The “use of force” or the “threat of force” mean any hostile actions against outer space objects including, inter alia, actions aimed at destroying them, damaging them, temporarily or permanently disrupting their normal functioning or deliberately changing their orbit parameters, or the threat of such actions. The PPWT prohibits space weapons as defined by stating that: [t]he States Parties undertake not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying any kinds of weapons, not to install such weapons on celestial bodies and not to place such weapons in outer space in any other manner; not to resort to the threat or use of force against outer space objects; and not to assist or induce other States, groups of States or international organizations to participate in activities prohibited by this Treaty. More important than what the PPWT prohibits is what it does not prohibit or address. An August 18, 2009, letter from the Russian Federation and PRC delegation to the Disarmament Conference addressed concerns with the PPWT raised by other members. In particular, the letter asserts that: The PPWT prohibits the use or threat of force against “outer space objects”, but it does not prohibit the use or threat of force in outer space. The PPWT does not alter the right to self-defense allowed under Article 51 of the UN Charter; so long as that weapon is not prohibited by international law and is not used against a signatory of the PPWT. The PPWT does not prohibit, the development, testing, and deployment of anti-satellite weapons (ASATs) so long as they do not meet the definition of “weapon in outer space” as defined by the PPWT. The PPWT does not prohibit the development, testing and deployment of ground-based lasers and electronic suppression systems. The PPWT does not address the issue of “dual-purpose” space technologies that could be employed both for peaceful or aggressive purposes. The PPWT does not include any mechanism for verification. The wording and interpretation of the PPWT works to the PRC’s advantage by allowing it to continue to develop and deploy direct-ascent ASAT technology and other ground-based ASAT techniques. On the other hand, countries such as the United States would be limited in the means it could use to develop and deploy defenses specifically if the means of defense might be defined as a space weapon under the PPWT. The PPWT and the United States’ space policy “Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of success. Rouse him, learn the principle of his activity and inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spot.” United States space policy has evolved to recognize the dependence on its outer space systems and their inherent vulnerability. On October 6, 2006, the Bush Administration released the unclassified, public version of the National Space Policy.8 Among the principles enunciated, the National Space Policy states that: The United States considers space capabilities — including the ground and space segments and supporting links — vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so; take those actions necessary to protect its space capabilities; respond to interference; and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests; This stance was considered provocative by many and drew the ire of political commentators and scholars alike. In particular, a scholar in US-China relations suggested that the National Space Policy articulated the goal of the United States to gain a monopoly in outer space to the exclusion of others, and that China might develop anti-satellite and space weapons to defend against that goal.9 Congress inquired whether the National Space Policy could have been the impetus to the PRC’s ASAT test, to which the State Department’s April 23, 2007, report concluded that: Even before issuance of the U.S. space policy, China conducted three previous tests of this direct-ascent ASAT weapon and, by September 2006, China had used a ground-based laser to illuminate a U.S. satellite in several tests of a system to “blind” satellites. Before and after this latest ASAT test, PRC military and civilian analysts have voiced concerns about China’s perceived vulnerability against U.S. dominance in military and space power. After the test, a Senior Colonel of the PLA’s Academy of Military Sciences said that “outer space is going to be weaponized in our lifetime” and that “if there is a space superpower, it’s not going to be alone, and China is not going to be the only one.” This counters that the proposition that the PRC’s motivation to perform the test was in response to the National Space Policy, and that the PRC had other rationales for performing it. The 2006 National Space Policy further addressed the importance of the continued integrity of the United States’ outer space systems by stating that: The United States will oppose the development of new legal regimes or other restrictions that seek to prohibit or limit U.S. access to or use of space. Proposed arms control agreements or restrictions must not impair the rights of the United States to conduct research, development, testing, and operations or other activities in space for U.S. national interests; This principle of the National Space Policy elicited in part the response of the United States to the PPWT on October 20, 2008. In a letter to the Chairman of the 63rd Session of the UN General Assembly during a debate on the disarmament aspects of the outer space, the United State’s public delegate, Karen E. House, stated that: [i]t has been the consistent policy of the United States to oppose arms control concepts, proposals, and legally-binding regimes that seek or impose prohibitions on the use of space for military or intelligence purposes. The United States also opposes any arms control proposals which fail to preserve the right of the United States to conduct research, development, testing and operations in space for military, intelligence, civil or commercial purposes. Ms. House, referring to the core space law treaties—the Outer Space Treaty, the Rescue Agreement, the Liability Convention, and the Registration Convention10 —also stated in her letter that: “it is also out long-standing position that the existing in-force regime is sufficient to guarantee the right of all nations for access to, and operations in, space.”11 The National Space Policy released by the Obama Administration on June 28, 2010,12 takes a similar but a subjectively less provocative tack concerning the integrity of United States space systems: The United States will employ a variety of measures to help assure the use of space for all responsible parties, and, consistent with the inherent right of self-defense, deter others from interference and attack, defend our space systems and contribute to the defense of allied space systems, and, if deterrence fails, defeat efforts to attack them. Consistent with this principle, the current National Space Policy takes a different approach with regard to new treaties concerning outer space: The United States will pursue bilateral and multilateral transparency and confidence-building measures to encourage responsible actions in, and the peaceful use of, space. The United States will consider proposals and concepts for arms control measures if they are equitable, effectively verifiable, and enhance the national security of the United States and its allies. Given the lack of a verification mechanism in the PPWT and the inherent difficulty of verifying such a treaty, it is doubtful that the current National Space Policy will direct the United States to pursue it. Two faces of the PRC’s defense policy? “Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance.” As noted earlier, much of the insight into the PRC’s intentions are the result of open-source information; however, there is evidence from official channels that may indicate the intentions and policy of the PRC. An article from the Washington Times reported on an missile-defense test performed by the PRC in 2010 using components of the ASAT system used in the January 2007 test.13 The information concerning the test was gleaned by from a diplomatic cable belonging to the United States and disclosed by Wikileaks.14 In addition to the information relating to the missile-defense test, the disclosed cable purportedly notes concerns from United States’ diplomats that Beijing has duplicitous motives in regards to the issue of weapons in spaces. According to the article, the cable purportedly contains concerns from United States’ diplomats that, while Beijing is promoting international treaties to limit or ban weapons in outer space, it is secretly developing its own missile defense and space weapons programs. The article continues that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, during a recent visit to Beijing, offered to hold talks with China on missile defense, space weapons, nuclear weapons, and cyber weapons, but was apparently rebuffed, with the PRC relegating the offer to be studied. If accurate, diplomatic channels seem to verify that while publically touting its intention to prevent a arms race in space, the PRC is willing to do so only on its terms and through mechanisms like the PPWT to the exclusion of other methods, all the while increasing its ability to neutralize United States space systems and gain an upper hand in outer space. The two faces of the PRC on outer space “When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it means the critical moment has come. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.” The combined open source material and information gleaned from official diplomatic communications suggest the PRC is following a two-pronged approach to address outer space security. The first prong of the PRC’s strategy is to publically denounce the weaponization of outer space and advocate the international community to enter into formal treaties banning space weapons as defined by the PRC thereby leaving the outer space systems belonging to its potential adversaries open to exploitation. The second prong of the PRC’s strategy is to continue to pursue the development and deployment of infrastructure both to deny an adversary the use of outer space while establishing an advantage in outer space.15 Given this, the PRC’s white paper concerning outer space could be a pretense to a more aggressive policy that could be phrased—hypothetically—as follows: To promote and actively engage foreign space powers in negotiations leading to legally binding international agreement(s) through the PPWT and its successors that would limit the defense and use of their space assets in the case of conflict. The People’s Republic of China will pursue these agreements while maintaining and improving its technical ability to defend its outer space assets and deny foreign space powers the access and use of outer space.16 If this reflects the true face of the PRC’s policy, then its white paper position towards outer space has more in common with the PRC’s perceptions of the greatly criticized National Space Policy authorized by the Bush Administration, making the PRC’s true stance anything other than the peaceful intentions as its white paper extols. Conclusion “All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is superior in strength, evade him. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.” The precise goals of the PRC in the arena of outer space policy cannot be completely understood through the information garnered from open-source and comprised official documents. However insufficient that information may be to make a thorough analysis of what the PRC’s intentions are, the international community should continue to be wary of the public perception that the PRC works so hard to manufacture and promote. For all its overtures of promoting the peaceful use of outer space, the PRC also cannot ignore the realities that outer space plays and will continue to play in the future. Surely, as the PRC strives to increase it geopolitical influence and exclude others those realities will become even more important in times of conflict. To that end, the lessons of Sun Tzu provide an excellent basis to understand the PRC’s approach to this important issue.<br />

The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services; the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets. One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland or an attack that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US.44Although a major attack on the US is not likely, the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculation that the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike. The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a </em>fait accompli//.45 A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49 The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “Space capabilities are no longer nice to have, but are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars.”51 The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets. The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52 Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives. The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces. Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability. The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55 Today, other nations are working to develop new weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—information war. The current coverage gaps in our space surveillance network, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons without our knowledge. Finally, without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy to counter an attack against US space assets. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is to deter an attack on US space assets. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. A senior officer in US Strategic Command recently stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution.57<br />

<strong>THE high-intensity scenario postulates</strong> a cross-strait war escalating into <strong>a full-scale war between the US and China</strong>. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. <strong>Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and</strong> -horror of horrors -<strong>raise the possibility of a nuclear war.

Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability<strong>, there is little hope of winning a war against China, 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons.</strong> The US estimates that <strong>China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities.</strong><strong>Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option.</strong><strong>A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons.</strong> Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it.

From a space control perspective, there are significant advantages to femtosats. Satellites in this size can be mass produced for relatively little cost, they are small enough to be undetected, and they can be combined in distributed satellite clusters, with many of the same capabilities as larger monolithic spacecraft.55 For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has proposed a fractionated spacecraft concept that distributes functions across a cluster of small spacecraft making the system easier to repair and more resilient to attack.56<br />

The good end of this is that space has a profound effect on the way we fight wars. Space systems provide our warfighters with an asymmetric advantage over adversaries and saves lives. Space enables our warfighters to operate in an effective fashion and to limit non-combatant collateral damage as they engage our adversaries. That is the good part. So, what is the bad? We simply cannot afford to continue providing these critical capabilities at the price we have been paying. We have heard it from every space leader and at every space conference: our space community is told to “do more with less”. Unfortunately, the catchphrases “do more with less” and even NASA’s “faster, better, cheaper” have lots of baggage and they’ve left failed programs behind in their wake. Programs have never done more with less and they’ve never been faster, better, and cheaper. The problem with these attempts at reducing cost was that they were really about trying to “find efficiencies” in the status quo. These attempts assumed the space industry is ineffective in the way that they do business; as a result, the US government has spent a huge amount of time and money trying to make industrial practices more efficient. This has been done for many years and through many administrations. There have been some savings made in the past, but there is just not much meat left on the bone to save after years and years of searching for efficiencies. Unfortunately, the assumption that our space industry could solve all its program problems with efficiency improvements was like throwing a thimble of water in the ocean. Perhaps a program can reap a few percentage points in savings with efficiency efforts, but more likely not in amounts that can move the needle on the problems and challenges we are facing. All of these efforts have been hamstrung by the real problem, an acquisition construct that is unaffordable. The current ways of setting requirements and acquiring large and complex Class A systems produce programs that are unwieldy and extremely expensive. These old ways are not working, and the space community desperately needs to find fundamentally different ways of doing its business. Indeed, the current way of doing acquisition is not going to resolve the conundrum, and the mantra “doing more with less” is becoming a new, tortured reality. All is not lost. To solve problems of affordability, we should consider building alternative innovative space system architectures. Specifically, we should consider architectures based on employment of disaggregated missions, mixed constellations (mixing Class A, B, C, and D developed systems), and mixing in some shorter life systems. Before making such a change, we need to understand how our space community got into this precarious position. Change is being driven by troubling trends (setting the stage) First—and this impacts the “why we need” affordability issue in our space industry—is that the rest of our nation is facing a very tough economy. We are experiencing one of those critical times in our nation’s history. Painful unemployment numbers confront us, and our national and state governments have borrowed too much. With the downturn, the money available for the DoD is shrinking and as a result, the aerospace industry that builds systems our warfighters have come to depend upon is going to see significant financial reductions. The industry and its customers have not yet reacted to the reduced fiscal realities of the aerospace industry. We have not come together to resolve these intractable problems, and, as a result, we are faced with a dilemma. On one hand, we all know that the economy is in a near-disaster condition. On the other, we hear the Department of Defense (DoD) is “underfunded” on a percentage basis. There must be a right level of spending. The Space Foundation tells us in its latest edition of The Space Report that the United States government spends something on the order of $65 billion a year on space. Governmental spending may not be that high, but one can count about $40–45 billion a year of spending among NASA, NRO, and the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center’s (SMC’s) accounts, and another $9 billion if you count the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). We use that money to provide for the national defense and to maintain a national technology edge, and that edge is essential to success and providing the advanced space systems needed by our warfighters, allies, and coalition partners. Still, $65 billion is a lot of money, and so is $40 billion, even if circumstances require we bring the number down a bit. We need to figure out a different way to get the space capabilities we need (since what we are currently buying is becoming more and more expensive) for significantly less than what we’ve been spending. Well, the aerospace industry can’t do too much about the economy. The reality is the space community does not control the economy, and it cannot singularly implement a fix for it through our programs, nor through our individual efforts. So we must treat the first factor, the economy, as a reality that we must deal with, and not ignore. The second factor getting us into a situation where our systems are becoming unaffordable is the way in which the DoD plans, programs, budgets, and buys space systems. This process has generated what should be called the “Space Acquisition Vicious Circle”, where each attempt to resolve problems in the acquisition process creates new problems. Currently, the US government contracts to build and fly only a few space systems, so it needs to get everything it possibly can out of each. That has meant, within current systems architecting approaches, bundling capabilities. With bundling, the government imposes as many requirements as possible onto a single mission. This is called aggregation, and is often used to build stronger cross-mission advocacy. Unfortunately, aggregation has a number of unintended, but very damaging, consequences: It takes many years to build these highly integrated bundled mission capabilities. With this reality, the US government customer demands that its contractors integrate advanced technology into a developed system, so that it is not totally obsolete when finally deployed. Unfortunately, try as they might, the resulting long schedule adds obsolescence along with technology and schedule risk to a system that is ultimately launched. The resulting high cost and risk minimizes the number of new program starts. The circular thinking behind this is if the US government cannot afford to approve many new starts, program planners, in an honest attempt to get the warfighters the space capabilities they need, think they should structure scarce, new programs to get everything out of them that can be funded. As users demand more and as a result of the previous step, acquirers design more and more complex systems to meet a greater number of aggregated requirements. This has the unfortunate consequence of generating complex and expensive sets of technical requirements for space acquisition efforts. Sometimes these requirements are at cross purposes (e.g., precision navigation and timing systems with nuclear detection capability). As a result, very complicated payloads are proposed, and they turn out to be very expensive and high risk to build and operate. Another unintended consequence is the resulting satellite systems are heavy, complex, and expensive to develop and operate. Spare satellites for such systems are unaffordable. With no spares, the acquirers must significantly increase system reliability, again increasing overall program cost. That means the system must be designed to work the first time, every time. It also means intense and expensive reviews of every developmental step, and even more extensive testing to be sure everything is very reliable and meets the multiple (and sometimes incompatible) requirements. That then drives cost and schedule. As the system becomes more expensive, less tolerance for risk is allowed. The system becomes too big to fail. So this leads to even more program reviews, senior service reviews, independent reviews, testing, and expense—and the vicious circle continues. Since this acquisition approach of buying aggregated satellites is expensive, funding needed to develop robust ground systems just like the funding for sparing is equally complex, and unaffordable. Ultimately, we are left with satellite systems that are very expensive and with heavy payloads, long development cycles, and no spares. Unfortunately, with no spares, programs cannot afford a launch failure. This all demands 100 percent launch success rates, which are also impossible to achieve. This in turn results in very expensive, risk averse, and expensive launch processing. The concern about risk drives demands for extensive launch reviews, both developer and programmatic, along with independent reviews. Launch affordability calls for fewer satellite systems, which results in a lower launch rate. As launch rate is the single biggest driver in the cost of launch, this now compounds our launch affordability problem. With very low launch rates we get expensive launches, or we get expensive launches because our rate is low. As launches become more and more expensive, the US government is compelled to reduce their number, which means we can only launch a select few important payloads. As launch costs are driven up, resistance rises to increasing the launch rate or using our launch vehicles by other agencies or commercial satellite builders. Finally, as costs skyrocket, we can’t afford to launch a wide variety of missions. So, with the Space Acquisition Vicious Circle, our space systems become more and more complex and expensive, with no room for failure. This Circle cannot be exited easily. Many are quick to point the fingers of blame for these failures, somehow thinking that these problems exist and the people implementing them are complicit and do not want to change their way of doing business due to stubbornness, and that all we have to do is change that thinking and that will solve the Circle’s problems. Of course, if this were really so, the Vicious Circle would have been fixed a long time ago. Given the affordability problems, something bold has to be done. We owe our warfighters the best systems we can provide. And the answer to all mission areas cannot be to encourage the US government to just buy off the shelf systems with minimum modification from generation to generation. Many needed military space capabilities do not have a commercial analog to drive technology development. Instead, we need resilient, adaptable, agile, and affordable approaches that will enable us to survive and operate in an increasingly hostile environment. We must truly do something fundamentally different than what we have been doing, to transcend the challenges of the Vicious Circle. Sadly, this need for action has encountered widespread denial and blame within government and industry circles. This is unfortunate since we simply cannot afford to continue to obtain these critical capabilities at the price we have been paying and suffer the delayed schedules resulting from developing highly complex/integrated systems. Given the warfighter need, cutting back on systems and capabilities is just not a viable answer. A better solution would be to change systems architectures in such a way to deliver needed capability and achieve improved space acquisition solutions by taking some acceptable, measured risk. Fortunately, our senior space leaders spotted the threat affordability problems present and have spoken frequently about the need to move forward and get out of this predicament. In looking at the threads of their public and private comments it is clear they understand the unrelenting pressures placed on the acquisition, deployment, and operation of space missions. They recognize that our space community faces tremendous competition on budget priorities, all while our young troops and society are more dependent on, and demand more and more capabilities provided from space. Building on what our senior leadership has described and putting a little more detail on how to accomplish this, along with some advantages, there are three changes that can be proposed as to how we should conduct our space business: The US government should selectively deploy disaggregated solutions (of course, this should be employed only on a mission by mission basis, where it makes sense) including using mixed constellations as an architectural approach to assuring cost effective resilience The US government should tolerate and balance more acquisition, technology, and customer risks on selected missions or sub-missions by using Class B, C, D systems development approaches on selected missions (not all missions make sense to go to Class B, C, or D, nor should all missions become Class A as they have been in the past) The US government should reduce mission lifetime requirements, as many advantages can accrue. So, what would this mean? Many believe the application of disaggregation combined with mixed constellations, is a smart approach to the challenges we face. Consideration of such architectures has been endorsed by present and former Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) and US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) commanders, Generals Kehler, Chilton, and Shelton. But what is meant by “disaggregated” and “mixed constellations”? Disaggregation is the concept of splitting the missions into larger numbers of smaller and more consistent missions/satellites with achievable requirements. This strategy presents a good opportunity to confront and reduce overall acquisition costs, and simplify acquisition rules and strategies. Mixed constellations combine extremely capable and exquisite flagship-class systems we are currently building, with less capable/shorter life/targeted capability Class B, C, and D payloads that can accomplish a significant portion, if not all, of the requirements. This in turn allows simplifying the flagship systems, and reduces the cost to provide the exquisite capabilities. Mixed constellations present a number of other valuable benefits: Distributed architectures are more effective against failures and active and passive attacks, increasing resilience. They provide multiple and independent phenomenology to threats. Distributed constellations provide the opportunity to have block upgrades rapidly responding to evolving threats. They create opportunities to assure technology insertion. We can take more chances on technologies with the lower cost, higher risk tolerant systems. Such systems could serve as technology pathfinders for the next generation. They incerase the number of launches to improve the launch industrial base and bring down costs. They sustain the industrial base by providing more frequent and more predictable systems being developed and launched. While aggregating missions and creating highly integrated and expensive satellites heretofore has been done in good faith, and by those who thought aggregating would help both program advocacy and lower costs, the actual result (in terms of cost) was the opposite. Program complexity, increased technology and schedule risks, and the resulting costs have gone through the roof. We were never able to reliably predict the real costs resulting from increased complexity or state the reason for such assertions. If we disaggregate, however, we can simplify entire space segments, and produce and operate simpler satellites. This should help reduce technical complexity and shorten the lengthy development cycles. In turn, this should improve industry production rates and mission survivability through a greater volume of systems.<br />

This paper is concerned with the GN&amp;C of a challenging type of formation flying, spacecraft swarms. The Silicon Wafer Integrated Femtosatellites (SWIFT) Swarm Project by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory presents a new paradigm-shifting definition of spacecraft technology that can enable light of swarms of fully capable femtosats. 13 In this paper, a swarm is defined as a collection of hundreds to thousands of spacecraft with masses on the order of 100g. These swarms have potential for use as optical relays, distributed antennas, or for massively distributed sensing applications among others. Ongoing research in microfabrication is developing the technologies required to fabricate, at low cost-per-unit, a 100g class of spacececraft, called femtosats, that can be actively controlled in all six degrees of freedom. 1<br />

Zeigler 7<br />
In the decades since the space program first began, the United States has come to depend on space as indispensable in many ways. That dependence, coupled with the growing threats of other actors seeking to deny the use of this medium, creates vulnerabilities that the United States is currently ill-equipped to address. The Distributed Real-time Awareness Global Network in Space (DRAGNETS) system comprised of constellations of thousands of miniaturized femtosats is a different way of looking at space situational awareness (SSA) than our current and future planned paradigm. Furthermore, DRAGNETS represents the natural convergence of the trend toward distributed, networked military solutions and the capabilities nanotechnology will enable over the next 20 years. This convergence will have significant cost and acquisition benefits, too. Once the DRAGNETS design has matured to the point of transition to an acquisition program, the system will take advantage of substantial cost savings in several areas. The satellite-on-a-chip implementation lends itself to mass-production efficiencies that will allow entire constellations of femtosats to be produced in a very small fraction of the time it takes to integrate a large satellite from the ground up. Additionally, functional and environmental testing can be accomplished in a streamlined fashion compared to today’s roughly year-long process, using much more cost-effective facilities and requiring far fewer paid workers to support. Finally, the launch options for a distributed system are very flexible, from single-launch insertion of entire constellations to incremental build-up using space-available services. In order to get to this point the United States will need to shepherd market enthusiasm and public trust.<br />

<span class="Underline">Misperception that space “takes too long and costs too much.” Fielding space capabilities is technically challenging and costly. Nevertheless, the US has fielded the world’s highest-performing space capabilities. Just as no space professional works in the “Non-Operationally Responsive Space Office,” no part of our space enterprise wants space capabilities to cost more and take longer. Nevertheless, the misperception that space takes too long and costs too much jeopardizes the enterprise’s ability to convince others to increase the space budget to field needed additional capability. Adding responsive space capabilities to the current mix of mostly exquisite space capabilities would provide additional capability and price data points and options. These would help space leaders better explain and justify the entire space portfolio. In the communications mission area, for example, small satellites are not cost competitive with large satellites on a “per channel” basis. The analysis behind that assertion is sound and drove us to the current constellation of large satellites. Small communication satellites can be fielded rapidly and flexibly, though, making them responsive and attractive for reconstitution, spot augmentation, and other unanticipated urgent communication needs. Adding responsive space capabilities to the current space architecture mix will improve the cost and schedule “bang for the buck,” help us </span>better justify the cost<span class="Underline"> and schedule attributes of the current space architecture, or quite possibly both. </span><br />

While the Obama administration has been signaling that it intends to cut the Air Force budget, and some Generals see this change as a way to better integrate the space side of the organization back into the Air Force as a whole, other experts speculate that the worst cuts will fall on the space sector. Taking control of the acquisition process away from the space professionals will facilitate crippling the space sector, which, if Chinese military preparations are any guide, could well be the next theater of war. These cuts in the acquisition role of the Air Force's space experts will prevent them from complaining too loudly about the cuts: they will lack access to the decision making process. Control over space-systems acquisition is being taken away from the space professionals and handed over to the Air Force's regular acquisition corps. While no one can doubt the competence of these experts to design and build top-of-the-line fighter and transport aircraft ,and, one hopes, bombers, they know little about the extremely unforgiving nature of the space environment. Outer space is as alien to those who have devoted their careers to the inside-the-atmosphere operating domain as the undersea environment is to an expert on desert warfare. America's space assets are essential to the nation's overall military power. Others have recognized this and see it as a vulnerability to be exploited. Unless the senior leaders in both the Air Force and the Defense Department are allowed by the administration to focus clearly on this danger, it will only grow. China's 2007 ASAT test was a sign that its military imagines that the future of warfare is going to include destructive operations in space. Recently, China has been detected practicing what appear to be automated orbital maneuvers, which could be in preparation for future civilian activities or have military implications, or both. China is just one of many nations seeking ways to use space for their own military purposes and to ensure that space systems will not be used against them. It is almost certain that in any future crisis or conflict involving powers with space capabilities, an effort will be made to negate, degrade or destroy the systems. It has been almost ten years since the regular Air Force acquisition experts have had anything to do with space systems. They will have a few advisors from the Air Force space team, but these professionals will be strangers at the table. They will lack the clout to force the top people within the acquisition organization to pay careful attention to space. Over the next two years or so, this may not have any ill effects; but beyond 2012 or 2013, things could get much worse. While the appointment of a Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force for Space is welcome, the authority that will go along with this post is negligible. That person will be responsible for &quot;space policy, issue integration and strategy,&quot; but as this office will lack the power to decide which, and how many, space systems to buy, its ability to make consequential decisions is questionable. Between now and 2015, several vital and very expensive space programs will enter into their decisive development and deployment phase. The first of these is the Space Base Infrared System (SBIRS), a series of heat sensing, early-warning satellites whose job it is to detect missile launches anywhere in the world, and to alert US forces. They are the direct successor to the Cold War era Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, which were designed originally to warn of a large scale Soviet nuclear attack. They provide essential cueing for missile defense systems, amd they once were designed to give the president warning that a major nuclear attack was on the way. Unrealistic performance requirements, which, for example, imagined that one version of these satellites would detect individual artillery pieces, drove up the costs. Constantly changing management personnel and unrealistic budget estimates nearly crippled SBIRS. Fortunately, a few unsung heroes, and the fact that replacing the DSPs was, and is, a supremely important national priority, saved the program from cancellation. A pair of SBIRS sensors riding as auxiliary payloads on top secret spy satellites are now in orbit, and, according to reports, are working well. The first of the dedicated SBIRS spacecraft is now planned to launch sometime early next year. In this critical task, there is a danger that the reorganization that has been ordered will distract too many of the Air Force's top professionals from their supervisory role over SBIRS. If anything goes wrong, the damage to the national interest, and the inevitable finger pointing, will be a major disaster for the Defense Department. Meanwhile, the Air Force will soon have to decide what kind of follow on system it wants to the pair of successful Space Tracking and Surveillance (STSS) experimental satellites launched last year. This program is designed to give America's Missile Defense forces the ability to track enemy missiles from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Integrating this data with that from large radars and other sensors will radically improve the accuracy of all US missile defense systems. This is yet another tough decision with which the reformed Air Force space organization will have to grapple. One disturbing sign is that the purchase of the second Space Based Surveillance Satellite (SBSS) has been postponed. The first one, designed to track space debris and give the US government an important new space situational awareness ability, was launched on September 25th from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The delay seems to be a sign that funding for space systems is so tight, that even essential systems are under stress. This applies to the SBSS which fits exactly with the priorities laid out by the President in his June 2010 National Space Policy, which aim to &quot;Strengthen Stability in Space&quot; and order the Secretary of Defense to &quot;Be responsible, with support from the Director of National Intelligence for the development and modernization of space situational awareness capabilities.&quot; Another essential military space program is GPS 3, the new and improved series of navigation satellites. By itself, GPS has done more to improve the lives of ordinary people all over the world than any other bit of space hardware, except perhaps weather satellites. Not even communications satellites have done more to prevent accidents, save lives, help prevent famines, reduce pollution and make war less destructive. The new of GPS spacecraft will provide better accuracy, better reliability and greater flexibility than the ones now in orbit. If the Air Force leaders get this wrong, it will be hard for the US ever to recover its place as the undisputed global leader in space based Positioning, Navigation and Timing technology. When a US administration tries to reorganize the military , or a major portion of it, it usually fails to achieve any real increase in efficiency or savings. These failure were all too apparent in the early 1960s, when Robert MacNamara and his whiz-kids reordered the entire Defense Department along what they thought were more rational lines. Thery discovered, in Washington, Vietnam and elsewhere, that neither America's enemies nor its people respond well to bloodless, uninspired management techniques.<br />
Key to nuclear primacy and ag<br />

Since it came into use in 1990, the US Air Force's GPS system has excited admiration and envy throughout the world. Former President Chirac of France complained that it was making the Europeans into &quot;Technological vassals of the Americans.&quot; Keeping the system healthy and safe has been a major policy priority of the George H. W. Bush, Clinton and George W, Bush administrations. The Obama administration's own National Space Policy, published in June 2010, says that &quot;The United States must maintain its leadership in the service, provision and the use of global navigation satellite systems [GPSs]. Although it is not often mentioned, the GPS is also an essential part of out nuclear deterrent. The guidance system on missiles, bombers and submarines all use the GPS, as well as its backup systems, to maintain the capacity for precision targeting of US nuclear warheads. It is no wonder that the opponents of global civilization, and of America in particular, have sought ways to jam, or knock out the system. The North Koreans recently launched a major jamming attack on the GPS signal that interfered with the system's operation to the extent that a US intelligence-gathering aircraft was forced to land with its mission uncompleted. In 1991, US Air Force officers were happy to explain that Saddam's attempt to transmit a jamming signal against the GP S system failed. The USAF simply destroyed the transmitter using a GPS guided bomb. In 2004 the US government forced the European Union to agree to change its plans to transmit a radio frequency signal that would have endangered the smooth operation of one of the GPS signals from its Galileo satellite navigation system. The uneven history of the development of the Galileo system, and the failure of the Europeans to find a workable &quot;commercial&quot; model for its development, is a sign of just how expensive and difficult it is to make a system like GPS work reliably and safely. The frequencies used to transmit the GPS signals are assigned to the US government by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) based in Geneva, Switzerland. The main frequencies, and others nearby on the electromagnetic spectrum whose use can interfere with the GPS signal, are highly coveted by America's rivals, such as the European Union and China. Keeping US control of these frequencies is a constant political struggle. America's diplomats have so far been successful, thanks in large part to the internationally recognized reliability and utility of the GPS system. As this scandal unfolds, the ITU and those who seek to break America's hold on the GPS signal frequencies will be watching carefully. If they see that the White House was prepared to endanger the integrity and reliability of the GPS signal to satisfy a campaign contributor, the effects could be disastrous. The next time a nation or group of nations try and convince the ITU to allow them to transmit signals that may harm the effectiveness of the GPS signal, the international bureaucrats in Geneva may decide to go along with the request. After all, they might reason, if the US President doesn't care to protect the safety and integrity of the GPS signals, why should they? The GPS system consists of a constellation of 31 satellites and two ground control stations,with the main one in Colorado and a back-up one in Maryland. Each satellite contains a highly accurate atomic clock and a set of transmitters. The satellites send a set of signals down to Earth where receivers measure the difference in the timing of the reception of each signal, known as the &quot;Time Offset.&quot; As the Air Force &quot;Space Primer says, &quot; Based on the time offset, the distance between the satellite and the receiver can be determined. This process is followed for at least four satellites. The cumulative information is entered into the position equations and calculated.&quot; The receiver then shows where the receiver is on Earth, helps one to navigate and also gives us access to an amazingly accurate time measuring device. The GPS has made possible, fror example, an agricultural revolution called &quot;Precision Farming,&quot; whereby farmers, by combining their knowledge of their fields' geology and the GPS signal, have been able to reduce radically the amounts of fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides they need to grow their crops. Other uses include banking, and of course the GPS receivers that the public uses for everything from hiking to getting to the grocery store. America's GPS has gone from being considered an expensive military luxury in the 1980s, to being a war-winning technology in the 1991 Gulf War, and now to being an essential part of 21st century civilized life<br />

AND, GPS III IS SPECIFICALLY KEY<br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">There are few capabilities as important to our military and the U.S. economy as GPS. GPS has become part of the fundamental infrastructure of our Armed Forces and a basic technology used in American society. Modern weapons systems, including precision strike munitions, rely on the exactitude that GPS technology provides. Moreover, our ability to maneuver combat forces depends on the navigation and timing provided continuously by GPS satellites. The civilian benefits of advances in GPS technology are also well documented. Millions of Americans benefit from GPS on a daily basis, whether using modern communications that rely on GPS timing, flying in commercial or private aircraft, navigating on land and at sea, surveying and mapping, disaster assistance, farming, banking, and ground transportation. As other nations begin operating similar navigation systems, it is essential to the military and civil community that these systems are interoperable in the manner that GPS III guarantees. Further, as adversaries seek to counter GPS signals through jamming, the added signal power of GPS III will assure continued availability for our warfighters in any location around the world. The GPS III contract was awarded following a full and open competition in 2008. The program is now in production with a first launch scheduled in 2014. The program is run by some of the nation’s most talented aerospace engineers in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The GPS III program was specifically designed to restore acquisition credibility through strong systems engineering and schedule certain development aimed at avoiding delays and cost overruns typically found in other space programs. Unfortunately, the House version of this bill would reduce funding for this model program, which is strongly supported by the U.S. Air Force and the user community. Additionally, the House bill includes $40 million in unrequested funding to restart an older, less capable second generation GPS system. I respectfully urge the Committee to reject the reductions in capability enhancements for GPS III proposed by the House. I also strongly urge the Committee to reject the unrequested earmark of $40 million included in the House bill. </span><br />

Global nuclear war<br />
Caves 10 (John P, Senior Research Fellow in the Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction at the National Defense University, January, Strategic Forum, No. 252, “Avoiding a Crisis of Confidence in the U.S. Nuclear Deterrent”)<br />
<br />
Perceptions of a compromised U.S. nuclear deterrent as described above would have profound policy implications, particularly if they emerge at a time when a nuclear-armed great power is pursuing a more aggressive strategy toward U.S. allies and partners in its region in a bid to enhance its regional and global clout. A dangerous period of vulnerability would open for the United States and those nations that depend on U.S. protection while the United States attempted to rectify the problems with its nuclear forces. As it would take more than a decade for the United States to produce new nuclear weapons, ensuing events could preclude a return to anything like the status quo ante. The assertive, nuclear-armed great power, and other major adversaries, could be willing to challenge U.S. interests more directly in the expectation that the United States would be less prepared to threaten or deliver a military response that could lead to direct conflict. They will want to keep the United States from reclaiming its earlier power position. Allies and partners who have relied upon explicit or implicit assurances of U.S. nuclear protection as a foundation of their security could lose faith in those assurances. They could compensate by accommodating U.S. rivals, especially in the short term, or acquiring their own nuclear deterrents, which in most cases could be accomplished only over the mid- to long term. A more nuclear world would likely ensue over a period of years. Important U.S. interests could be compromised or abandoned, or a major war could occur as adversaries and/or the United States miscalculate new boundaries of deterrence and provocation. At worst, war could lead to state-on-state employment of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) on a scale far more catastrophic than what nuclear-armed terrorists alone could inflict.<br />

Ag is key to solve global war and extinction<br />

In a world confronted by global terrorism, turmoil in the Middle East, burgeoning nuclear threats and other crises, it is easy to lose sight of the long-range challenges. But we do so at our peril. One of the most daunting of them is meeting the world’s need for food and energy in this century. At stake is not only preventing starvation and saving the environment, but also world peace and security. History tells us that states may go to war over access to resources, and that poverty and famine have often bred fanaticism and terrorism. Working to feed the world will minimize factors that contribute to global instability and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. With the world population expected to grow from 6 billion people today to 9 billion by mid-century, the demand for affordable food will increase well beyond current international production levels. People in rapidly developing nations will have the means greatly to improve their standard of living and caloric intake. Inevitably, that means eating more meat. This will raise demand for feed grain at the same time that the growing world population will need vastly more basic food to eat. Complicating a solution to this problem is a dynamic that must be better understood in the West: developing countries often use limited arable land to expand cities to house their growing populations. As good land disappears, people destroy timber resources and even rainforests as they try to create more arable land to feed themselves. The long-term environmental consequences could be disastrous for the entire globe. To meet the expected demand for food over the next 50 years, we in the United States will have to grow roughly three times more food on the land we have. That’s a tall order. My farm in Marion County, Indiana, for example, yields on average 8.3 to 8.6 tonnes of corn per hectare – typical for a farm in central Indiana. To triple our production by 2050, we will have to produce an annual average of 25 tonnes per hectare. Can we possibly boost output that much? Well, it’s been done before. Advances in the use of fertilizer and water, improved machinery and better tilling techniques combined to generate a threefold increase in yields since 1935 – on our farm back then, my dad produced 2.8 to 3 tonnes per hectare. Much US agriculture has seen similar increases. But of course there is no guarantee that we can achieve those results again. Given the urgency of expanding food production to meet world demand, we must invest much more in scientific research and target that money toward projects that promise to have significant national and global impact. For the United States, that will mean a major shift in the way we conduct and fund agricultural science. Fundamental research will generate the innovations that will be necessary to feed the world. The United States can take a leading position in a productivity revolution. And our success at increasing food production may play a decisive humanitarian role in the survival of billions of people and the health of our planet.<br />

Nuclear war—the plan is key <br />
Thompson 11 (Loren Thompson is chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute. “New Satellite Provides ‘Just-in-time’ Deterrence” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spacenews.com/commentaries/110613-sat-just-in-time-deterrence.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacenews.com/commentaries/110613-sat-just-in-time-deterrence.html</a>, Donnie) <br />
It was a big relief to U.S. defense officials in May when the first geosynchronous satellite in the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) successfully reached orbit. The new spacecraft is equipped with sensors that will provide the first indication of hostile missile launches, nuclear explosions and other heat-generating events around the globe relevant to national security. Such information is essential to nuclear deterrence, which as currently practiced requires the nation’s strategic arsenal to be capable of surviving an attack and then retaliating in a controlled and proportionate manner. If news of enemy missile launches is not received quickly, the ability of U.S. forces to respond effectively might be so uncertain as to impair the entire structure of deterrence. There isn’t much doubt that the SBIRS constellation will be a big improvement over existing Defense Support Program satellites. Each of the four geosynchronous satellites positioned about 36,000 kilometers above the equator will carry a scanning sensor with three times the sensitivity and twice the revisit rate of legacy sensors, plus a staring sensor that can provide persistent, higher-resolution coverage of specific areas (like Iran or North Korea). The sensitivity and timeliness of information generated by the new satellites will also enable the SBIRS constellation to provide valuable reconnaissance for the nation’s ballistic missile defense system, conventional warfighters and intelligence analysts. But the core mission, the one that matters most, is assuring sufficient warning of hostile missile launches so that the nation’s nuclear arsenal can credibly deter aggression. What many observers don’t grasp is how tenuous the existing missile warning system has become. The first and most vital line of defense in that system since 1970 has been the legacy satellites that SBIRS will replace. Prime contractor Northrop Grumman has introduced numerous upgrades to the Defense Support Program satellites that have improved their reliability, sensitivity and survivability. However, a review of the program’s launch history indicates that the Air Force has managed to successfully launch only one of the satellites in the last 10 years — which is very worrisome when you consider that the nominal design life for the latest versions of Defense Support Program satellites is only five years. Fortunately, the satellites typically exceed their design life by 250 percent, and some have lasted even longer. But there’s a reason engineers specify conservative design lives, so the fact that the last successful launch of a legacy satellite occurred in 2004 means that America’s missile warning network is living on borrowed time. Under the original SBIRS development plan, there was little danger of a gap in missile warning. The new spacecraft were supposed to begin reaching orbit in 2002, providing plenty of time to transition from the legacy constellation to the new one. But a variety of hardware and software problems delayed the program by many years, and then in 2008 the last (and most recently launched) Defense Support Program spacecraft mysteriously failed in orbit. It was the unforeseen combination of SBIRS delays and a legacy satellite failure that got policymakers scrambling to identify options for filling a potential gap in missile warning. What they learned to their dismay is that there weren’t any viable alternatives to stretching out the performance of the Defense Support Program and straining to get SBIRS into orbit as soon as possible. There are a number of possibilities for squeezing more life out of the Defense Support Program satellites, from reducing the fuel margins required for boosting them into retirement orbits to working around the failure of specific components in an architecture designed for redundancy. But at this point some of the satellites in use must be “single string” spacecraft, meaning there are no backups for key functions, because the most recent Defense Support Program satellites still believed to be functioning were launched in 2000, 2001 and 2004. That’s a long time to be operating continuously in space without any repairs. The launch of SBIRS sensors on two National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) satellites in highly elliptical polar orbits beginning in 2006 has somewhat diminished the danger while bolstering confidence in the sensors to be carried on the more capable geosynchronous birds. But the sensors hosted by NRO can’t provide the coverage afforded by near-circular equatorial orbits at geosynchronous distances, so there’s no alternative to fielding the full SBIRS architecture. Policymakers appear to believe that the legacy constellation will be viable through 2013, after which SBIRS will have to assume most of the missile warning mission. Thus, a lot is riding on the success of the GEO-1 satellite that reached orbit in May. With solar panels and antennas deployed, operators are testing the twin sensors and other on-board equipment to make sure they meet performance specifications. SBIRS has been an uncommonly controversial program that began during a period of turmoil in space acquisition and was saddled with more requirements than any satellite should have to meet (three times too many, the Defense Science Board said in 2003). But the most capable part of the system has now reached orbit with all of its “key performance parameters” intact, which is a major achievement for prime contractor Lockheed Martin and payload integrator Northrop Grumman. It is also a big victory for the U.S. Air Force, which stuck with the SBIRS architecture despite years of criticism. Its leaders understood the urgency of replacing legacy missile warning satellites before they failed. However, it will still be some time before the constellation is fully deployed, so the danger has not passed. The bottom line on nuclear deterrence is that it isn’t likely to work unless U.S. leaders have reliable information about what other nuclear powers are doing, and right now SBIRS is the only solution that can meet that need in a timely fashion.<br />

<span class="Underline">The major source of social friction, including international friction, has surely always been unequal access to resources. People ﬁght to control the valuable resources on and under the land, and in and under the sea. The natural resources of Earth are limited in quantity, and economically accessible resources even more so. As the population grows, and demand grows for a higher material standard of living, industrial activity grows exponentially. The threat of resources becoming scarce has led to the concept of ‘‘Resource Wars’’. Having begun long ago with wars to control the gold and diamonds of Africa and South America, and oil in the Middle East, the current phase is at centre stage of world events today [37]. A particular danger of ‘‘resource wars’’ is that, if the general public can be persuaded to support them, they may become impossible to stop as resources become increasingly scarce. Many commentators have noted the similarity of the language of US and UK government advocates of ‘‘war on terror’’ to the language of the novel ‘‘1984’’ which describes a dystopian future of endless, fraudulent war in which citizens are reduced to slaves. 7.1. Expansion into near-Earth space is the only alternative to endless ‘‘resource wars’’ As an alternative to the ‘‘resource wars’’ already devastating many countries today, opening access to the unlimited resources of near-Earth space could clearly facilitate world peace and security. The US National Security Space Ofﬁce, at the start of its report on the potential of space-based solar power (SSP) published in early 2007, stated: ‘‘Expanding human populations and declining natural resources are potential sources of local and strategic conﬂict in the 21st Century, and many see energy as the foremost threat to national security’’ [38]. The report ended by encouraging urgent research on the feasibility of SSP: ‘‘Considering the timescales that are involved, and the exponential growth of population and resource pressures within that same strategic period, it is imperative that this work for ‘‘drilling up’’ vs. drilling down for energy security begins immediately’’ [38]. Although the use of extra-terrestrial resources on a substantial scale may still be some decades away, it is important to recognise that simply acknowledging its feasibility using known technology is the surest way of ending the threat of resource wars. That is, if it is assumed that the resources available for human use are limited to those on Earth, then it can be argued that resource wars are inescapable [22,37]. If, by contrast, it is assumed that the resources of space are economically accessible, this not only eliminates the need for resource wars, it can also preserve the beneﬁts of civilisation which are being eroded today by ‘‘resource war-mongers’’, most notably the governments of the ‘‘Anglo-Saxon’’ countries and their ‘‘neo-con’’ advisers. It is also worth noting that the $1 trillion that these have already committed to wars in the Middle-East in the 21st century is orders of magnitude more than the public investment needed to aid companies sufﬁciently to start the commercial use of space resources. Industrial and ﬁnancial groups which proﬁt from monopolistic control of terrestrial supplies of various natural resources, like those which proﬁt from wars, have an economic interest in protecting their proﬁtable situation. However, these groups’ continuing proﬁts are justiﬁed neither by capitalism nor by democracy: they could be preserved only by maintaining the pretence that use of space resources is not feasible, and by preventing the development of low-cost space travel. Once the feasibility of low-cost space travel is understood, ‘‘resource wars’’ are clearly foolish as well as tragic. A visiting extra-terrestrial would be pityingly amused at the foolish antics of homo sapiens using longrange rockets to ﬁght each other over dwindling terrestrial resources—rather than using the same rockets to travel in space and have the use of all the resources they need! 7.2. High return in safety from extra-terrestrial settlement Investment in low-cost orbital access and other space infrastructure will facilitate the establishment of settlements on the Moon, Mars, asteroids and in man-made space structures. In the ﬁrst phase, development of new regulatory infrastructure in various Earth orbits, including property/usufruct rights, real estate, mortgage ﬁnancing and insurance, trafﬁc management, pilotage, policing and other services will enable the population living in Earth orbits to grow very large. Such activities aimed at making near-Earth space habitable are the logical extension of humans’ historical spread over the surface of the Earth. As trade spreads through near-Earth space, settlements are likely to follow, of which the inhabitants will add to the wealth of different cultures which humans have created in the many different environments in which they live. Success of such extra-terrestrial settlements will have the additional beneﬁt of reducing the danger of human extinction due to planet-wide or cosmic accidents [27]. These horrors include both man-made disasters such as nuclear war, plagues or growing pollution, and natural disasters such as super-volcanoes or asteroid impact. It is hard to think of any objective that is more important than preserving peace. Weapons developed in recent decades are so destructive, and have such horriﬁc, long-term side-effects that their use should be discouraged as strongly as possible by the international community. Hence, reducing the incentive to use these weapons by rapidly developing the ability to use space-based resources on a large scale is surely equally important [11,16]. The achievement of this depends on low space travel costs which, at the present time, appear to be achievable only through the development of a vigorous space tourism industry. 8. Summary As discussed above, if space travel services had started during the 1950s, the space industry would be enormously more developed than it is today. Hence the failure to develop passenger space travel has seriously distorted the path taken by humans’ technological and economic development since WW2, away from the path which would have been followed if capitalism and democracy operated as intended. Technological know-how which could have been used to supply services which are known to be very popular with a large proportion of the population has not been used for that purpose, while waste and suffering due to the unemployment and environmental damage caused by the resulting lack of new industrial opportunities have increased. In response, policies should be implemented urgently to correct this error, and to catch up with the possibilities for industrial and economic growth that have been ignored for so long. This policy renewal is urgent because of the growing dangers of unemployment, economic stagnation, environmental pollution, educational and cultural decline, resource wars and loss of civil liberties which face civilisation today. In order to achieve the necessary progress there is a particular need for collaboration between those working in the two ﬁelds of civil aviation and civil space. Although the word ‘‘aerospace’’ is widely used, it is largely a misnomer since these two ﬁelds are in practice quite separate. True ‘‘aerospace’’ collaboration to realise passenger space travel will develop the wonderful profusion of possibilities outlined above. 8.1. Heaven or hell on Earth? As discussed above, the claim that the Earth’s resources are running out is used to justify wars which may never end: present-day rhetoric about ‘‘the long war’’ or ‘‘100 years war’’ in Iraq and Afghanistan are current examples. If political leaders do not change their viewpoint, the recent aggression by the rich ‘‘Anglo-Saxon’’ countries, and their cutting back of traditional civil liberties, are ominous for the future. However, this ‘‘hellish’’ vision of endless war is based on an assumption about a single number—the future cost of travel to orbit—about which a different assumption leads to a ‘‘heavenly’’ vision of peace and ever-rising living standards for everyone. If this cost stays above 10,000 Euros/kg, where it has been unchanged for nearly 50 years, the prospects for humanity are bleak. But if humans make the necessary effort, and use the tiny amount of resources needed to develop vehicles for passenger space travel, then this cost will fall to 100 Euros/kg, the use of extra-terrestrial resources will become economic, and arguments for resource wars will evaporate entirely. The main reason why this has not yet happened seems to be lack of understanding of the myriad opportunities by investors and policy-makers. Now that the potential to catch up half a century of delay in the growth of space travel is becoming understood, continuing to spend 20 billion Euro-equivalents/year on government space activities, while continuing to invest nothing in developing passenger space travel, would be a gross failure of economic policy, and strongly contrary to the economic and social interests of the public. Correcting this error, even after such a costly delay, will ameliorate many problems in the world today. As this policy error is corrected, and investment in proﬁtable space projects grows rapidly in coming years, we can look forward to a growing world-wide boom. Viewed as a whole, humans’ industrial activities have been seriously underperforming for decades, due to the failure to exploit these immensely promising ﬁelds of activity. The tens of thousands of unemployed space engineers in Russia, America and Europe alone are a huge waste. The potential manpower in rapidly developing India and China is clearly vast. The hundreds of millions of disappointed young people who have been taught that they cannot travel in space are another enormous wasted resource. We do not know for certain when the above scenario will be realised. However, it could have such enormous value that considerable expenditure is justiﬁed in order to study its feasibility in detail [5]. At the very least, vigorous investment by both private and public sectors in a range of different sub-orbital passenger vehicle projects and related businesses is highly desirable. Fortunately, the ambitious and rapid investment by the Indian and Chinese governments in growing space capabilities may ﬁnally jolt the space industries of Russia, America, Europe and Japan out of their long economic stagnation, and induce them to apply their accumulated know-how to economically valuable activities—notably supplying widely popular travel services to the general public.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The global economy is failing off the road to recovery—all macroeconomic indicators prove </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Prasad and Foda 11 (Eswar Prasad, Senior Fellow, Global Economy and Development Karim Foda, Research Analyst, Global Economy and Development “Why the Global Economic Recovery is in Trouble” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2011/0919_tiger_prasad.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2011/0919_tiger_prasad.aspx</a> //Donnie) </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The world economy has hit a rough patch on the road to recovery and is in danger of skidding off course. The latest update of the Brookings Institution-FT Tracking Indices for the Global Economic Recovery (TIGER) reveals abundant cause for gloom. The general picture among G-20 economies is one of slowing growth, swooning financial markets, and declining consumer and business confidence. A series of adverse shocks, coupled with political wrangling that has stymied effective policymaking and added to uncertainty, has crippled growth in advanced economies. Emerging markets have maintained strong growth so far, but the battle against domestic inflation and weaknesses in major export markets are beginning to affect their growth as well. Debt crises, weak employment growth and policy dithering in the major advanced economies have exacerbated global economic uncertainty. The perception of rising risk and inadequate policy responses has shaken financial markets and dented confidence around the world. Reflecting widespread anxiety and fear about global economic prospects and the lack of obvious policy solutions, stock markets around the world have taken a beating over the past summer. The U.S. recovery has been hurt by a withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in the short run and little decisive action in tackling the long-term debt problem, exactly the opposite of what’s needed. Political wrangling and weak employment growth have contributed to declines in business and consumer confidence, with these factors feeding off one another and stunting the recovery. Economic activity has lost momentum, with growth in GDP and industrial production slowing down. Japan is still reeling from the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami, with political instability contributing to a lethargic economy that is unable to shake off its torpor. Most macroeconomic indicators—including GDP, employment and exports—are weak and show little sign of recovering anytime soon. </span><br />

The plan is critical to prevent a replay of world war two—deficit spending is key<br />
Krugman 10 (Paul, Nobel Prize winning economist, need I say more? I will just in case, professor of Economics and International Affairs at Princeton University. Mr. Krugman received his B.A. from Yale University in 1974 and his Ph.D. from MIT in 1977. He has taught at Yale, MIT and Stanford. At MIT he became the Ford International Professor of Economics. “1938 in 2010” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/opinion/06krugman.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/opinion/06krugman.html</a>, Donnie)<br />
Now, we weren’t supposed to find ourselves replaying the late 1930s. President Obama’s economists promised not to repeat the mistakes of 1937, when F.D.R. pulled back fiscal stimulus too soon. But by making his program too small and too short-lived, Mr. Obama did just that: the stimulus raised growth while it lasted, but it made only a small dent in unemployment — and now it’s fading out. And just as some of us feared, the inadequacy of the administration’s initial economic plan has landed it — and the nation — in a political trap. More stimulus is desperately needed, but in the public’s eyes the failure of the initial program to deliver a convincing recovery has discredited government action to create jobs. In short, welcome to 1938. The story of 1937, of F.D.R.’s disastrous decision to heed those who said that it was time to slash the deficit, is well known. What’s less well known is the extent to which the public drew the wrong conclusions from the recession that followed: far from calling for a resumption of New Deal programs, voters lost faith in fiscal expansion. Consider Gallup polling from March 1938. Asked whether government spending should be increased to fight the slump, 63 percent of those polled said no. Asked whether it would be better to increase spending or to cut business taxes, only 15 percent favored spending; 63 percent favored tax cuts. And the 1938 election was a disaster for the Democrats, who lost 70 seats in the House and seven in the Senate. Then came the war. From an economic point of view World War II was, above all, a burst of deficit-financed government spending, on a scale that would never have been approved otherwise. Over the course of the war the federal government borrowed an amount equal to roughly twice the value of G.D.P. in 1940 — the equivalent of roughly $30 trillion today. Had anyone proposed spending even a fraction that much before the war, people would have said the same things they’re saying today. They would have warned about crushing debt and runaway inflation. They would also have said, rightly, that the Depression was in large part caused by excess debt — and then have declared that it was impossible to fix this problem by issuing even more debt. But guess what? Deficit spending created an economic boom — and the boom laid the foundation for long-run prosperity. Overall debt in the economy — public plus private — actually fell as a percentage of G.D.P., thanks to economic growth and, yes, some inflation, which reduced the real value of outstanding debts. And after the war, thanks to the improved financial position of the private sector, the economy was able to thrive without continuing deficits. The economic moral is clear: when the economy is deeply depressed, the usual rules don’t apply. Austerity is self-defeating: when everyone tries to pay down debt at the same time, the result is depression and deflation, and debt problems grow even worse. And conversely, it is possible — indeed, necessary — for the nation as a whole to spend its way out of debt: a temporary surge of deficit spending, on a sufficient scale, can cure problems brought on by past excesses. But the story of 1938 also shows how hard it is to apply these insights. Even under F.D.R., there was never the political will to do what was needed to end the Great Depression; its eventual resolution came essentially by accident. I had hoped that we would do better this time. But it turns out that politicians and economists alike have spent decades unlearning the lessons of the 1930s, and are determined to repeat all the old mistakes. And it’s slightly sickening to realize that the big winners in the midterm elections are likely to be the very people who first got us into this mess, then did everything in their power to block action to get us out. But always remember: this slump can be cured. All it will take is a little bit of intellectual clarity, and a lot of political will. Here’s hoping we find those virtues in the not too distant future.<br />

Less intuitive is how periods of <span style="text-decoration: none;">economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict.</span> <u><a class="wiki_link" href="/home">Political science</a></u> literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that <span style="text-decoration: none;">rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next</span>. As such, exogenous shocks such as <span style="text-decoration: none;">economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power</span> (see also Gilpin. 1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, <span style="text-decoration: none;">increasing the risk of miscalculation</span> (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, <span style="text-decoration: none;">even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict</span> as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland's (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that <span style="text-decoration: none;">'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states</span>. He argues that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, <span style="text-decoration: none;">if the expectations of future trade decline</span>, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could</span> potentially be the <span style="text-decoration: none;">trigger</span> for <span style="text-decoration: none;">decreased trade expectations</span> either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, <span style="text-decoration: none;">others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Blomberg and Hess</span> (2002) <span style="text-decoration: none;">find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn</span>. They write: The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the <span style="text-decoration: none;">presence of a recession tends to </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">amplify the extent</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other</span>. (Blomberg &amp; Hess, 2002. p. 89) <span style="text-decoration: none;">Economic decline has</span> also <span style="text-decoration: none;">been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism</span> (Blomberg, Hess, &amp; Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. <span style="text-decoration: none;">&quot;Diversionary theory&quot; suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect.</span> Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that <span style="text-decoration: none;">the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states</span> than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that <span style="text-decoration: none;">periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force</span>. In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas <span style="text-decoration: none;">political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels</span>.5 This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.<br />

Our overall goal should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. security. The U.S. has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies. These vital space assets face three forms of threats, all of them worrisome and growing: 1) With the proliferation of space and other technologies, and specifically with the anti-satellite (ASAT) capability China demonstrated two years ago, there is a risk that China or another adversary could exploit this fast-growing U.S. dependence on space in a war to greatly weaken U.S. military and economic power. China could do so and thus pose a serious threat to U.S. space assets within a decade if it chose to do so. China is also pursuing other programs that have important ASAT implications, and other nations are interested in ASAT as well. The 2008 U.S. shoot-down of an errant satellite demonstrated the ASAT capability inherent to missile defense systems, ours and others. Last week Russia indicated renewed interest in ASAT weapons when their deputy defense minister, General Valentin Popovkin, stated that Russia is working on ASAT. 2) Space “traffic” is heavier than it has ever been and getting worse, both in terms of physical vehicles and communications. Yet there is no “FAA for space” and even just the monitoring, much less the management, of space objects is widely seen as far less than needed. There is a great need for space traffic management capabilities, including enforceable rules of the road, codes of conduct, and space situational awareness that would inform a “space FAA” management capability. 3) Space debris poses an insidious and growing threat to all space assets. Debris in space does not quickly fall to the ground, as on earth; at all but the lowest orbits, debris can stay aloft for centuries and more. In addition to the 17,000 orbiting objects the Air Force can track, there are hundreds of thousands of potentially lethal objects in orbit, and millions of smaller objects that pose at least some risk. The recent collision between a U.S. Iridium satellite and an old Russian Cosmos dramatically illustrated the problem. Our space assets are exposed and fragile. They can’t run, they can’t hide, and today they can’t defend themselves. One small object traveling at orbital speeds can destroy them. Unless we take proactive measures, all these threats will grow, and we must bear in mind that the U.S. depends more on space than our potential adversaries. If we are not careful, the way we are currently thinking, planning, and investing, our space capabilities may only be available in peacetime, or against non-peer adversaries. We could lose them just when we need them most. At a minimum, we need far greater space situational awareness and space intelligence (SSA/SI) capabilities than today. Responsible officials have been saying this for years, but SSA/SI has never received the priority it deserves. If this fails to change, we can expect more frequent space collisions and growing instability in space. I will focus on the hostile threat dimensions of our overall military space challenges, though orbital debris and space traffic management also deserve priority attention.<br />

The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying -- its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe 's stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world 's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe -- if it adopted what some call a strategy of &quot;offshore balancing&quot; -- this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn 't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn 't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.<br />

Implications for U.S. Policymakers.” “A new policy typology to better understand the goals of China’s space program” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:8161:http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/2 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/2" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/2</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:8161 -->, Donnie)<br />
Given the dual-use nature of most space technology, it is no surprise that China’s military uses of space are advancing commensurately with its civilian and commercial programs. First of all, China is widely known to have an array of intelligence satellites for space reconnaissance and surveillance. The Ziyuan Earth observation satellite is known to be one of these, but China has also fielded the Fanhui Shi Weixing, or Retrievable Satellite, which drops canisters of film from space.15 China’s ongoing microsatellite program has sparked some of the most concern abroad. Aside from intelligence satellites, microsatellites have many potential offensive uses such as maneuvering in range of an adversary’s satellite and either latching on—a “parasitic microsat”—to disrupt proper functions, or merely exploding within range of a target satellite to destroy it. Furthermore, the ability to deploy a constellation of microsatellites on short notice, a capability China may already possess with its Kaituozhe launch vehicle, denies the deterrence factor that could otherwise prevent offensive attacks on an adversary’s space assets for fear of retaliation. China’s rocket technology also has proven offensive military use in space: the ability to shoot down enemy assets in space through direct ascent attacks. China demonstrated such ability in 2007, which has been the impetus for much of the recent speculation about China’s military space aspirations. Despite political blowback from this test (it resulted in a 20 percent increase in the total amount of trackable space debris in low Earth orbit), China may still be pursuing ASAT technologies.16 In January 2010 China conducted a successful test of its ground-based midcourse missile interception technology. This test used technology similar to its 2007 ASAT test and, as exemplified by the US Navy-led Operation Burnt Frost that intercepted the satellite USA 193, missile defense technology can serve ASAT ends. In addition to these hard-kill capabilities, China has the capability to use soft-kill measures to neutralize adversary’s space assets. China is known to have the means to jam satellite communication and GPS receivers and is developing directed energy ASATs, including high-powered microwave and particle beam weapons.17 The US Department of Defense (DoD), in their annual report to Congress on China’s military modernization, also notes that China is developing ground-based laser ASATs, the beginnings of which may have already been demonstrated. In 2006 the director of the National Reconnaissance Office, Donald Kerr, substantiated reports that China used a ground-based laser to dazzle a US spy satellite over its territory. Although this laser could not do any long-term damage, similar techniques and capabilities used to track and dazzle this satellite could be coupled with more powerful ground-based lasers to destroy space assets. Some reports actually indicate China has already tested and deployed a ground-based ASAT laser that can target assets in LEO.18 Despite the array of activity the PLA conducts in and through space, they seem to lack a specific doctrine for the employment of their space capabilities and have not made public any substantial plans for military uses of space. In lieu of a formal declaration on space, there is a growing literature from within the PLA ranks that may be forming the basis for what later becomes stated—or unstated—PLA space doctrine. These authors generally hold the same assumptions about space, including the inevitability that space will be a domain of war in the future.19 Many also acknowledge that establishing space dominance will be crucial to fully exploiting wartime necessities such as control of airspace and secure command and control.20<br />
Three internal Chinese sources are largely cited as being the defining PLA space doctrine writings: Space War by Colonel Li Daguang; On Space Operations by Colonel Jia Junming; and Joint Space War Campaigns by Colonel Yuan Zelu.21 Colonel Li highlights many specific recommendations to develop the PLA’s space fighting capabilities, including fielding offensive capabilities capable of “destroying or temporarily incapacitating all enemy space vehicles that fly in space above our sovereign territory.” Other recommendations include focusing development on land-based anti-satellite weapons and anti-satellite satellites as well as “assassin’s mace” space weapons that could deal a crippling blow to an enemy. Particularly important to foreign perceptions of China, these writings also call for China to combine military and civilian technology and integrate peacetime and wartime facilities.<br />
Other authors on the subject promote such actions as: fielding sea-launched anti-satellite weapons, attacking GPS with high energy laser weapons, fielding stealthy space satellites and weapons, and seeking the ability to attack terrestrial targets from space. Kevin Pollpeter, summing up the view of most Chinese authors writing on the subject, writes, “The development of space technology will inevitably lead to the militarization of space and space militarization will lead to confrontation in space. As the struggle over air and space control is becoming the new focal point of war, space will become the main battlefield of future wars.”22 Pollpeter also notes that throughout his extensive review of Chinese space writings, there were no rebuttals to the view that China will inevitability develop and use counterspace weapons.<br />
These views also seem to be held by some in the upper echelons of the PLA. In November 2009, PLA Air Force (PLAAF) commander Xu Qiliang stated in an interview with the PLA Daily newspaper, an official government publication, that the militarization of space is a “historical inevitability” and called on the PLAAF to develop offensive and defensive capabilities in space.23 Xu is not only the head of the PLAAF, but as of 2007 was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (CCCP) and a member of the Central Military Commission (CMC)—two primary policy decision making bodies in China. The Foreign Ministry tried to backtrack on Xu’s comments days later by reiterating that China has “all along upheld the peaceful use of outer space,” and would not be part of a space arms race.24 However, Xu did not personally retract his statements and, given his elite government position, this interview could actually be exemplary of how some of China’s top official’s views space. Indeed, there is some indication the CCCP acknowledges the need to prepare for the weaponization of space. In December 2010, the official publication of the CCCP, the Qiushi Journal, on its website released an article that spoke to China’s perspectives on space war: China's missiles can directly attack the military satellites, which usually orbit at an altitude less than 10,000 kilometers...China should make efforts to develop space weapons as soon as possible, as this is the most effective military means of attacking the U.S. If we can eventually fire missiles from a satellite, the U.S. will find that it has nowhere to hide; it will find itself entirely exposed to the attack radius of Chinese weaponry…Vigorously strengthening the building of our space military forces should be not only the focus of our national defense, but also the most powerful weapon to deter U.S. military blackmail.25 After the article was translated into English, the original Chinese version was altered to state that the views were those of the authors only. In a society well versed in controlling media and hiding military intentions, it is interesting the Chinese government is allowing these and other perspectives to be published containing such inflammatory language on space warfare. This suggests that perhaps the views are not condemned or are being floated as trial balloons to gauge foreign response.<br />

Chinese doctrine, spending, and actions all portend an attack on US space assets - it will likely escalate<br />
Wortzel, 8 - Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY<br />
AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons.77 These include: . satellite jamming technology; . collisions between space bodies; . kinetic energy weapons; . space-to-ground attack weapons; . space planes that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space; . high-power laser weapons; . high-power microwave weapon systems; . particle-beam weapons; and . electromagnetic pulse.78 PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success. PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S.81 One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. As the PLA modernizes its own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict. The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis. For example, four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College, in Wuhan, have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85 In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88 The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems. One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research. Space Deterrence Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems. In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability. Conclusions There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA. U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims;97 the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory. The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures. Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability. PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature. By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict.<br />

The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services; the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets. One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland or an attack that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US.44 Although a major attack on the US is not likely, the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculation that the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike. The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a fait accompli.45 A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49 The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “Space capabilities are no longer nice to have, but are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars.”51 The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets. The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52 Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives. The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces. Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability. The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55 Today, other nations are working to develop new weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—information war. The current coverage gaps in our space surveillance network, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons without our knowledge. Finally, without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy to counter an attack against US space assets. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is to deter an attack on US space assets. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. A senior officer in US Strategic Command recently stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution.57<br />

<em>The United States has five satellites in geostationary orbit that detect missile launches using the heat released from their exhaust plumes. These satellites are primarily used to alert US nuclear forces to massive nuclear attacks on the homeland. However, in recent years, they have played an increasing role in conventional conflicts, such as both Gulf Wars, by cueing tactical missile defenses like the Patriot missile defense systems that gained fame in their engagements with Saddam’s SCUD missiles. Because of this new use, China might find it useful to attack them with ASATs. Since there are only five of them, China could destroy the entire constellation but at the cost of diverting some of the few available deep-space ASATs from other targets. Of course, China would not have to attack all five but could limit its attack to the three that simultaneously view the Taiwan Straits area. If China did decide to destroy these early warning satellites, it would greatly reduce the area covered by US missile defenses in Taiwan against SCUD and longer range missiles. This is because the area covered by a theater missile defense system is highly dependent on the warning time it has; the greater the warning time, the more effective the missile defense system’s radar is. Thus a Patriot battery, which might ordinarily cover the capital of Taiwan, could be reduced to just defending the military base it was stationed at. Some analysts believe that China would gain a tremendous propaganda coup by having a single missile make it through US defenses and thus might consider this use of its deep-space ASATs highly worthwhile even if it could not increase the probability of destroying military targets. On the other hand, China would run a tremendous risk of the US believing it was under a more general nuclear attack if China did destroy these early warning satellites. Throughout the history of the Cold War, the US has had a policy of only launching a “retaliatory” nuclear strike if an incoming attack is detected by both early warning satellites and radars. Without the space leg of the early warning system, the odds of the US misinterpreting some missile launch that it detected with radar as a nuclear attack would be greatly increased even if the US did not view the satellite destruction as a sufficiently threatening attack all by themselves. Such a misinterpretation is not without precedent. In 1995, Russia’s early warning radars viewed a NASA sounding rocket launch off the coast of Norway and flagged it as a possible Trident missile launch. Many analysts believe that Russia was able to not respond only because it had a constellation of functioning early warning satellites. Any Chinese attacks on US early warning satellites would risk both intentional and mistaken escalation of the conflict into a nuclear war without a clear military goal.</em><br />

<em>A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study</em><br />

<em>(STRAITS TIMES, June 25, 2K, Pg. l/n)</em><br />
<em>THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -horror of horrors -raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China, 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilization.</em><br />

<em>From a space control perspective, there are significant advantages to femtosats. Satellites in this size can be mass produced for relatively little cost, they are small enough to be undetected, and they can be combined in distributed satellite clusters, with many of the same capabilities as larger monolithic spacecraft.55 For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has proposed a fractionated spacecraft concept that distributes functions across a cluster of small spacecraft making the system easier to repair and more resilient to attack.56</em><br />

<br />
<em>Finally, the growing Chinese capability for space warfare implies that a future conflict in the Taiwan Strait would entail serious deterrence and crisis instabilities. If such a clash were to compel Beijing to attack US space systems at the beginning of a war, the very prospect of such a ‘space Pearl Harbor’94 could, in turn, provoke the United States to contemplate pre-emptive attacks or horizontal escalation on the Chinese mainland. Such outcomes would be particularly likely in a conflict in the next decade, before Washington has the opportunity to invest fully in redundant space capabilities. Already, US Strategic Command officials have publicly signalled that conventionally armed Trident submarine- launched ballistic missiles would be appropriate weapons for executing the prompt strikes that might become necessary in such a contingency.95 Such attacks, even if employing only conventional warheads, on space launch sites, sensor nodes and command and control installations on the Chinese mainland could well be perceived as a precursor to an all-out war. It would be difficult for all sides to limit the intensification of such a conflict, even without the added complications of accidents and further misperception.96</em><br />

A little further away, we can improve our space situational awareness, which is going to take a while, and improve our command and control for active measures, such as orbit adjustments or perhaps intercepting things that are on their way up to get us in higher orbits. We might also move toward a distributed architecture for our military support systems. What is interesting about this as well is not only that these things that are real defenses and don’t depend on the deterrent threat of punishment, but that they have also don’t put weapons in space nor do they invite warfare in space. We need space in order for warfare here on the ground, but we don’t particularly need warfare in space. So in sum, I am urging you to consider only the capability to deny someone the military incentive to strike our space assets. That is the defense option, a response to more of the risks that might initiate attacks and that provides more options for limiting the consequences if those attacks should happen. The defense of our military assets in space is possible without requiring miracles of technology. They are sustainable and effective, no matter what other governments or their constituent elements believe. The defenses provide options that we want if the attacks do come anyway. And if an attack is then seen as too difficult to blind or deafen us, then presumably opponents will seek options other than attacks on our satellites. Now if you want to say then that they are deterred, fine. They might be inhibited, dissuaded, discouraged, diverted – I don’t care. But if they get it wrong and they do try to attack us, we have something that we can do about it and we can survive. So our mantra in responding to those would threaten our space assets, I think, should be, in keeping with the latest campaign, “No, you can’t.” If you seek defense, I think deterrence will look after itself.<br />

<em>Try and pursue a strategy of deterrence by denial. Deny the adversary the benefits of attacking your satellite systems by installing, whenever possible, passive defenses on satellites, such as hardening against electromagnetic pulse attacks, measures to make jamming more difficult, and ablative shielding to help satellites both withstand actual physical attacks and survive space debris impacts. Eventually, as individual threats become more defined, active defenses should also be seriously considered, although this will be much further in the future. In tandem with passive defenses, develop and accelerate programs for rapid launch of satellites to reconstitute lost systems and to bolster constellations in times of crisis. Also needed are spare satellites in storage here on earth that can be launched at short notice. While the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program is seeking to address these issues with the use of small satellites, efforts should also be made to speed up the time it takes to place larger satellites and more traditional systems that are being used in orbit. I suggest that we prioritize space situational awareness programs in order to build as quickly as possible a comprehensive picture of the space environment, something that we are severely lacking today. If policy makers and commanders possess the ability to differentiate between purposeful attacks and the hazards of the natural space environment, then the potential for misperception and miscalculation is dramatically reduced. Furthermore, effective deterrence is strengthened by the fact that space situational awareness could potentially indicate the nature and origins of any attempted attack on a satellite, something that would be very challenging given that there are many ways in which one can attack a satellite, including cyber.</em><br />

<em>The nuclear shadow over the information age remains significant. The essence of information warfare is in subtlety and deception: the manipulation of uncertainty. The essence of nuclear deterrence lies in the credible and certain threat of retaliation backed by an information environment accepted and trusted by both sides in a partly competitive, partly conflictual relationship. Nuclear assets may themselves become the targets of cyberwarriors. Triumphalism about the RMA in high technology conventional weapons overlooks asymmetrical strategies that might appeal to U.S. opponents. Among these might be the reciprocal use of information warfare to deny U.S. access in time of need to a timely nuclear response or to a credible nuclear threat. But even more problematic is the potential collision course between intentional information warfare and unintended side effects when cyberwar is waged against a nuclear armed state, especially one with a non-Western culture. Neither the status of nuclear forces in the new world order, nor all of the military implications of the information revolution, are apparent now. There are reasons to suppose that the strategies and technologies of information warfare will develop along one track, whereas efforts to control nuclear weapons spread and to establish the safety and security of existing nuclear arsenals will involve a different community of specialists and attentive publics. Nevertheless, there are sufficient grounds to be concerned that a too successful menu of information strategies may contribute to a failure of nuclear deterrence in the form of accidental/inadvertent war or escalation. Unplanned interactions between infowarriors and deterrers could have unfortunate byproducts.</em><br />

This matrix illustrates the linkages from mission to space environmental condition to system anomaly to warfighter impact from left to right. Ultimately, if we are completely ignorant of environmental stressing effects, the resulting potential warfighter impacts are described in the right hand column. For example, Comms-on-the-Move (OTM) is a capability provided by SATCOM. If space weather interferes with tactical SATCOM at certain times and the user has adequate warning, they can effectively plan for the disruption, switching to terrestrial communication or using more robust SATCOM. Another example is precision engagement. If the accuracy (Circular Error Probable or CEP) for certain GPS aided munitions is affected by space weather, the weapons planners need to know about it in order to more effectively plan for the type of weapon system to be employed—or they might delay the mission in order to avoid potential collateral damage. Still another example is satellite operations and the requirement to unambiguously determine the source of a spacecraft anomaly. For the warfighter, this is especially noticeable if the satellite in question is dedicated to their area of responsibility (AOR) for communications, navigation, weather, or missile warning. Having the ability to rapidly determine the source as environmental not only helps get the system back on line faster, it can also help distinguish from other sources such as hostile attack.<br />

Cyber and space domains are contributing a tremendous measure of complexity to the challenge of deterring future adversaries. Deterrence and escalation control now cross multiple domains of war. Attacks against space assets intended to blind or dazzle for tactical or operational effect may be perceived as precursors to broader, deeper strategic attacks. Computer network attacks may have huge unintended consequences for the entire global system. And new conventional capabilities may have farreaching deterrent effects. In Europe, for example, while the United States and Russia argue over the role of ballistic missile defenses in our strategic relationship, some assert that the alliance can afford to trade off nonstrategic nuclear capabilities while deploying ballistic missile defenses. Also, there is an emerging debate on the deterrent value of conventionally armed intercontinental missiles that could fly a ballistic trajectory for part of their path and then shift to a more maneuverable mode during reentry. 9 Such complex escalation and deterrence relationships heighten the potential for misperceptions and increase the risks of unleashing catalytic escalation forces. In this milieu, Herman Kahn’s ladder of escalation is less helpful as a mental model of deterrence. In a bipolar world, escalation was linear. Now, escalation can function across many dimensions not limited to the nuclear escalation ladder. In the multipolar, proliferated nuclear world, deterrence exists across at least four domains simultaneously—conventional, nuclear, cyber, and space. Dr. Chris Yeaw, Air Force Global Strike Command’s chief scientist, likened this to a vortex in which each side could escalate or deescalate simultaneously across multiple domains and even jump from one ladder to another, making crisis management and escalation control much more complicated.<br />

If escalation is more like a vortex than a ladder, then chances are a crisis in the multipolar, proliferated nuclear world will be more like 1914 than 1939 in terms of its potential for spiraling out of control. The twenty-first century is fraught with risks of misperceptions among crisis participants from divergent cultural perspectives and with clashing strategic interests. These risks are compounded by the fact that every newly nuclear state goes through a period of learning about its new role; it must learn both how it intends to employ its nuclear capabilities to achieve their deterrent effects and how to keep them safe, secure, and reliable in their particular geopolitical environment. Unanticipated consequences abound with emerging warfare domains such as cyber and space. Timelines for decision, already made very short by the Cold War capabilities of ballistic missiles, will be even further compressed by nearly instantaneous and ubiquitous effects of a globally interconnected world order.<br />

In this <u><a class="wiki_link" href="/home">paper</a></u> we demonstrate how a cloud-based computing architecture can be used for planetary defense and space situational awareness (SSA). We show how utility compute can facilitate both a financially economical and highly scalable solution for space debris and near-earth object impact analysis. As we improve our ability to track smaller space objects, and satellite collisions occur, the volume of objects being tracked vastly increases, increasing computational demands. Propagating trajectories and calculating conjunctions becomes increasingly time critical, thus requiring an architecture which can scale with demand. The extension of this to tackle the problem of a future near-earth object impact is discussed, and how cloud computing can play a key role in this civilisation-threatening scenario. Introduction Space situational awareness includes scientific and operational aspects of space weather, near-earth objects and space debris. This project is part of an international effort to provide a global response strategy to the threat of a Near Earth Object (NEO) impacting the earth, led by the United Nations Committee for the Peaceful Use of Space (UN-COPUOS). The impact of a NEO – an asteroid or comet – is a severe natural hazard but is unique in that technology exists to predict and to prevent it, given sufficient warning. As such, the International Spaceguard survey has identified nearly 1,000 potentially hazardous asteroids &gt;1km in size although NEOs smaller than one kilometre remain predominantly undetected, exist in far greater numbers and impact the Earth more frequently1 . Impacts by objects larger than 100 m (twice the size of the asteroid that caused the Barringer crater in Arizona) could occur with little or no warning, with the energy of hundreds of nuclear weapons, and are “devastating at potentially unimaginable levels”2 (Figure 1). The tracking and prediction of potential NEO impacts is of international importance, particularly with regard to disaster management. Space debris poses a serious risk to satellites and space missions. Currently Space Track3 publishes the locations of about 10,000 objects that are publicly available. These include satellites, operational and defunct, space debris from missions and space junk. It is believed that there are about 19,000 objects with a diameter over 10cm. Even the smallest space junk travelling at about 17,000 miles per hour can cause serious damage; the Space Shuttle has undergone 92 window changes due to debris impact, resulting in concerns that a more serious accident is imminent4 , and the International Space Station has to execute evasion maneuvers to avoid debris. There are over 300,000 objects over 1cm in diameter and there is a desire to track most , if not all of these. By improving ground sensors and introducing sensors on satellites the Space Track database will increase in size. By tracking and predicting space debris behaviour in more detail we can reduce collisions as the orbital environment becomes ever more crowded. Cloud computing provides the ability to trade computation time against costs. It also favours an architecture which inherently scales, providing burst capability. By treating compute as a utility, compute cycles are only paid for when they are used. Here we present a cloud application framework to tackle space debris tracking and analysis, that is being extended for NEO impact analysis. Notably, in this application propagation and conjunction analysis results in peak compute loads for only 20% of the day, with burst capability required in the event of a collision when the number of objects increases dramatically; the Hypervelocity Impact Technology Facility (Missions from STS-50 through STS-114). [Online] <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:8171:http://hitf.jsc.nasa.gov --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hitf.jsc.nasa.gov" rel="nofollow">http://hitf.jsc.nasa.gov</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:8171 -->. Iridium-33 Cosmos-2251 collision in 2009 resulted in an additional 1,131 trackable objects (Figure 2). Utility computation can quickly adapt to these situations consuming more compute, incurring a monetary cost but keeping computation wall clock time to a constant . In the event of a conjunction event being predicted, satellite operators would have to be quickly alerted so they could decide what mitigating action to take. In this work we have migrated a series of discrete manual computing processes to the Azure cloud platform to improve capability and scalability. It is the initial prototype for a broader space situational awareness platform. The workflow involves the following steps: obtain satellite position data, validate data, run propagation simulation, store results, perform conjunction analysis, query satellite object, and visualise. Satellite locations are published twice a day by Space Track, resulting in bi-daily high workloads. Every time the locations are published, all previous propagation calculations are halted, and the propagator starts recalculating the expected future orbits. Every orbit can be different, albeit only slightly from a previous estimate, but this means that all conjunction analysis has to be recomputed. The quicker this workflow is completed the quicker possible conjunction alerts can be triggered, providing more time for mitigation. The concept project uses Windows Azure as a cloud provider and is architected as a data-driven workflow consuming satellite locations and resulting in conjunction alerts, as shown in Figure 3. Satellite locations are published in a standard format know as a Two-Line Element (TLE) that fully describes a spacecraft and its orbit. Any TLE publisher can be consumed, in this case the Space Track website, but also ground observation station data. The list of TLEs are first separated into individual TLE Objects, validated and inserted into a queue. TLE queue objects are consumed by comparator workers which check to see if the TLE exists; new TLEs are added to an Azure Table and an update notification added to the Update Queue. TLEs in the update notification queue are new and each requires propagation; this is an embarrassingly parallel computation that scales well across the cloud. Any propagator can be used. We currently support NORAD SGP4 propagator and a custom Southampton simulation (C++) code. Each propagated object has to be compared with all other propagations to see if there is a conjunction (predicted close approach). Any conjunction source or code can be used, currently only SGP4 is implemented; plans are to incorporate more complicated filtering and conjunction analysis routines as they become available. Conjunctions result in alerts which are visible in the Azure Satellite tracker client. The client uses Virtual Earth to display the orbits. Ongoing work includes expanding the Virtual Earth client as well as adding support for custom clients by exposing the data through a REST interface. This pluggable architecture ensures that additional propagators and conjunction codes can be incorporated, and as part of ongoing work we intend to expand the available analysis codes. The framework demonstrated here is being extended as a generic space situational service bus to include NEO impact predictions. This will exploit the pluggable simulation code architecture and the cloud’s burst computing capability in order to allow refinement of predictions for disaster management simulations and potential emergency scenarios anywhere on the globe. Summary We have shown how a new architecture can be applied to space situational awareness to provide a scalable robust data-driven architecture which can enhance the ability of existing disparate analysis codes by integrating them together in a common framework. By automating the ability to alert satellite owners to potential conjunction scenarios we reduce the potential of conjunction oversight and decrease the response time, thus making space safer. This framework is being extended to NEO trajectory and impact analysis to help improve planetary defencs capability for all.<br />

Once upon a time there was a Big Bang... Cause/Effect - Cause/Effect -Cause/Effect and fifteen billion years later we have this chunk of cosmos weighing in at a couple trillion tons, screaming around our solar system, somewhere, hair on fire at a million miles a day, on course to the subjective center of the universe. Left to its own fate -- on impact -- this Rock would release the kinetic energy equivalent of one Hiroshima bomb for every man, woman and child on the planet. Game Over... No Joy... Restart Darwin's clock… again. No happy ever after. There is simply no empirical logic or rational argument that this could not be the next asteroid to strike Earth or that the next impact event could not happen tomorrow. And as things stand we can only imagine a handful of dubious undeveloped and untested possibilities to defend ourselves with. There is nothing we have actually prepared to do in response to this event. From an empirical analysis of the dynamics and geometry of our solar system we have come to understand that the prospect of an Earth/asteroid collision is a primal and ongoing process: a solar systemic status quo that is unlikely to change in the lifetime of our species. And that the distribution of these impact events is completely aperiodic and random both their occasion and magnitude. From abstracted averaged relative frequency estimates we can project that over the course of the next 500 million years in the life of Earth we will be struck by approximately 100,000 asteroids that will warrant our consideration. Most will be relatively small, 100 to 1,000 meters in diameter, millions of tons: only major city to nation killers. 1,000 or so will be over 1,000 meters, billions of tons and large enough to do catastrophic and potentially irrecoverable damage to the entire planet: call them global civilization killers. Of those, 10 will be over 10,000 meters, trillions of tons and on impact massive enough to bring our species to extinction. All these asteroids are out there, orbiting the sun... now. Nothing more needs to happen for them to go on to eventually strike Earth. As individual and discrete impact events they are all, already, events in progress. By any definition this is an existential threat. Fortunately, our current technological potential has evolved to a point that if we choose to do so we can deflect all these impact events. Given a correspondingly evolved political will, we can effectively manage this threat to the survival of our species. But since these events are aperiodic and random we can not simply trust that any enlightened political consensus will someday develop spontaneously before we are faced with responding to this reality. If we would expect to deflect the next impact event a deliberate, rational punctuated equilibrium of our sociopolitical will is required now. The averaged relative frequency analysis described above or any derived random-chance statistical probabilistic assessment, in itself, would be strategically meaningless and irrelevant (just how many extinction level events can we afford?). However, they can be indirectly constructive in illuminating the existential and perpetual nature of the threat. Given that the most critically relevant strategic increment can be narrowly defined as the next “evergreen” 100 years, it would follow that the strategic expression of the existent risk of asteroid impact in its most likely rational postulate would be for one and only one large asteroid to be on course to strike Earth in the next 100 years... If we do eventually choose to respond to this threat, clearly there is no way we can address the dynamics or geometry of the Solar System so there is no systemic objective we can respond to here. We can not address 'The Threat of Asteroid Impact' as such. We can only respond to this threat as these objects present themselves as discrete impending impactors: one Rock at a time. This leaves us the only aspect of this threat we can respond to - a rationally manifest first-order and evergreen tactical definition of this threat Which unfortunately, as a product of random-chance, includes the prospect for our extinction. Asteroid impact is a randomly occurring existential condition. Therefore the next large asteroid impact event is inevitable and expectable, and that inevitable expectability begins... now. The Probability is Low: As a risk assessment: “The probability for large asteroid impact in the next century is low”... is irrelevant. Say the daily random-chance probability for large asteroid impact is one in a billion. And because in any given increment of time the chance that an impact will not happen is far greater than it will, the chance that it will happen can be characterized as low. However, if we look out the window and see a large asteroid 10 seconds away from impact the daily random-chance probability for large asteroid impact will still be one in a billion... and we must therefore still characterize the chance of impact as low... When the characterization of the probability can be seen to be tested to be in contradiction with the manifest empirical fact of the assessed event it then must also then be seen to be empirically false. Worse: true only in the abstract and as such, misleading. If we are going to respond to these events, when it counts the most, this method of assessment will not be relevant. If information can be seen to be irrelevant ex post it must also be seen to be irrelevant ex ante. This assessment is meaningless. Consider the current threat of the asteroid Apophis. With its discovery we abandon the average relative frequency derived annual random-chance probability for a rational conditional-empiric probabilistic threat assessment derived from observing its speed, vector and position relative to Earth. The collective result is expressed in probabilistic terms due only to our inability to meter these characteristics accurately enough to be precise to the point of potential impact. As Apophis approaches this point the observations and resulting metrics become increasingly accurate and the conditional-empiric probability will process to resolve into a certainty of either zero or one. Whereas the random-chance probability is unaffected by whether Apophis strikes Earth or not. These two probabilistic perceptions are inherently incompatible and unique, discrete and nonconstructive to each other. The only thing these two methodologies have in common is a nomenclature: probability/likelihood/chance, which has unfortunately served only to obfuscate their semantic value making one seem rational and relevant when it can never be so. However, merely because they are non rational does not make averaged relative frequency derived random-chance probabilities worthless. They do have some psychological merit and enable some intuitive 'old lady' wisdom. When we consider the occasion of some unpredictable event that may cause us harm and there is nothing tangible we can do to deflect or forestall or stop it from happening, we still want to know just how much we should worry about it. We need to quantify chance not only in in case we can prepare or safeguard or insure against potentially recoverable consequences after the fact, but to also meter how much hope we should invest against the occasion of such events. Hope mitigates fear. And when there is nothing else we can do about it only then is it wise to mitigate fear... “The probability for large asteroid impact in the next century is low” does serve that purpose. It is a metric for hope. Fifty years ago, before we began to master space and tangibly responding this threat of asteroid impact became a real course of action, hope was all we could do. Today we can do much more. Today we can hold our hope for when the time comes to successfully deflect. And then, after we have done everything we can possibly do to deflect it, there will still be of room for hope... and good luck. Until then, when anyone says that the probability for large asteroid impact or Extinction by NEO is low they are offering nothing more than a metric for hope -- not rational information constructive to metering a response or making a decision to do so or not. Here, the probability is in service to illusion... slight-of-mind... and is nothing more than comfort-food-for-thought. We still need such probabilistic comfort-food-for-thought for things like Rogue Black Holes and Gamma Bursts where we are still imaginably defenseless. But if we expect to punctuate the political equilibrium and develop the capability to effectively respond to the existential threat of asteroid impact, we must allow a rational and warranted fear of extinction by asteroid impact to drive a rational and warranted response to this threat forward. Forward into the hands and minds of those who have the aptitude and training and experience in using fear to handle fearful things. Fear focuses the mind... Fear reminds us that there are dire negative consequences if we fail. If we are going to concern ourselves with mounting a response and deflecting these objects and no longer tolerate and suffer this threat, would it not be far more relevant to know in which century the probability for large asteroid impact was high and far more effective to orient our thinking from when it will not to when it will occur? But this probabilistic perspective can not even pretend to approach providing us with that kind of information. As such, it can never be strategically relevant: contribute to the conduct of implementing a response. The same can be said when such abstract reasoning is used to forward the notion that the next asteroid to strike Earth will likely be small... This leads us to little more than a hope based Planetary Defense. If we are ever to respond to this threat well then we must begin thinking about this threat better. Large Asteroid Impacts Are Random Events. Expect the next one to occur at any time. Strategically speaking, this means being at DefCon 3: lock-cocked and ready to rock, prepared to defend the planet and mankind from the worst case scenario, 24/7/52... forever. Doing anything less by design, would be like planning to bring a knife to a gunfight. If we expect our technological abilities to develop and continue to shape our nascent and still politically tacit will to respond to this threat: if we are to build an effective Planetary Defense, we must abandon the debilitating sophistry of “The probability for large asteroid impact in the next century is low” in favor of rational random inevitable expectation... and its attendant fear.<br />

<em>Now the Defense Department wants to up the stakes with new, destabilizing weapons systems that will transform low- and high-earth orbit into another &quot;battlespace,&quot; pouring billions into programs to achieve what Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) has long dreamed of: &quot;space dominance.&quot; Indeed, Pentagon space warriors fully intend to field a robust anti-satellite (ASAT) capability that can disable, damage or destroy the satellites of other nations, all for &quot;defensive&quot; purposes, mind you. Back in 2005, The New York Times reported that General Lance W. Lord, then commander of AFSPC, told an Air Force conference that &quot;space superiority is not our birthright, but it is our destiny. ... Space superiority is our day-to-day mission. Space supremacy is our vision for the future.&quot; Five years on, that &quot;mission&quot; is still a top priority for the Obama administration. While some might call it &quot;net-centric warfare&quot; on steroids, I'd choose another word: madness. On April 22, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) successfully launched its robot space shuttle, the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Sitting atop a Lockheed Martin Atlas V rocket, the unmanned, reusable space plane roared into orbit after more than ten years of development by Boeing Corporation's &quot;Phantom Works&quot; black projects shop. The successful orbital insertion of the X-37B was the culmination of a decades' long dream by the Department of Defense: to field a reusable spacecraft that combines an airplane's agility with the means to travel at 5 miles per second in orbit. From the Pentagon's point of view, a craft such as the X-37B may be the harbinger of things to come: a johnny-on-the-spot weapons platform to take out the satellite assets of an enemy de jour, or as a launch vehicle that can deliver bombs, missiles or kinetic weapons anywhere on earth in less than two hours; what Air Force wags refer to as &quot;operationally responsive space.&quot; Prior to launch, Air Force Deputy Undersecretary of Space Programs, Gary Payton, ridiculed speculation that the X-37B is the prototype for a new space-based weapons system. Payton told reporters, &quot;I don't know how this could be called a weaponization of space. Fundamentally, it's just an updated version of the space shuttle kinds of activities in space.&quot; Needless to say, such denials should be taken with the proverbial grain of salt. The highly-classified program has a checkered history. According to GlobalSecurity.org, the project is envisaged as a &quot;reusable space architecture&quot; that would provide &quot;aircraft-like operability, flexibility, and responsiveness, supporting AF Space Command mission areas.&quot; While early examples such as the Dyna-Soar/X-20 program of the 1950s-1960s never panned out due to technological constraints, the Air Force never stopped trying. Programs such as the X-40 Space Maneuver Vehicle (SMV) and the X-41 Common Air Vehicle (CAV), a hypersonic craft intended to serve as a key component in developing the off-again, on-again &quot;Prompt Global Strike&quot; project, demonstrate continuing Air Force interest in &quot;high frontier&quot; weapons programs. The X-40 project eventually merged with the Air Force's X-37B program and the X-41 CAV program has been absorbed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (HTV-2). Last month, the first test of the Falcon (apparently) ended in failure when DARPA researchers claimed they had lost contact with the craft moments after take-off from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The Falcon was supposed to demonstrate the feasibility of launching a vehicle to the edge of space and then have it come &quot;screaming back into the atmosphere, maneuvering at twenty times the speed of sound before landing north of the Kwajalein Atoll, 30 minutes later and 4100 nautical miles away,&quot; according to Wired. Did the HTV-2 mission fail? Since misdirection and disinformation have long been staples of Pentagon black world projects, most likely we'll never know one way or the other. Inevitably, even if these projects amount to no more than monumental failures, their intended target audience, China, Russia or any other nation viewed as a &quot;rogue state&quot; by the imperialist hyperpower, in all likelihood would be drawn in to an expensive, and deadly, contest to devise countermeasures. In this light, Space.com reporter Jeremy Hsu wrote May 5, that ambiguities in devising militarized space technology &quot;can make it tricky for nations to gauge the purpose or intentions behind new prototypes.&quot; And such uncertainties are precisely the fodder that fuel an arms race. According to GlobalSecurity.org's John Pike, the U.S. military &quot;could even be using the cloak of mystery to deliberately bamboozle and confuse rival militaries.&quot; Pike told Space.com that &quot;the X-37B and HTV-2 projects could represent the tip of a space weapons program hidden within the Pentagon's secret 'black budget,' or they might be nothing more than smoke and mirrors.&quot; Pike said that current work &quot;leaves plenty of room for misinterpretation or even outright deception, which could be a ploy to distract other nations with military space projects.&quot; &quot;'One of them could be a deception program and the other could be the spitting image of the real thing,' Pike noted. He said that such misdirection could force other nations' militaries to waste money chasing down dead ends.&quot; While Pike's assertions sound plausible, given the Pentagon's track record and an annual $50 billion black budget directed towards research on new weapons and surveillance systems, the X-37B, the Falcon HTV-2 or other systems on the drawing board would certainly be useful assets if the military chose to deploy them as offensive weapons.</em><br />

Less ambitious perhaps, but potentially more destabilizing than unproven hypersonic technology, the X-37B was originally designed by Boeing for NASA in 1999 as an emergency escape vehicle for the International Space Station. The civilian agency once viewed the craft as a potential lifeboat that could rescue stranded astronauts from the ISS. However, with Russia's Soyuz space capsule doing yeoman's work for just such a contingency, NASA no longer saw the need for an expensive winged re-entry vehicle and dropped the program. But, as with all things having to do with the Military-Industrial Complex's insatiable appetite for new weapons, DARPA, the Pentagon's &quot;blue sky&quot; geek shop, picked up the slack in 2004 when NASA headed towards the exit. After further testing and design enhancements by DARPA, the project was handed off to the Air Force in 2006. The program is now run by the USAF's secretive Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) and spokespeople there have been tight lipped, refusing to say how much the vehicle costs; a sure sign that funds for the robot shuttle come from the black side of the budget where new weapons systems spawn and metastasize. A tip-off to the covert nature--and militaristic intentions--of the program, comes from the office running the show. According to an Air Force Fact Sheet, the RCO &quot;responds to Combat Air Force and combatant command requirements&quot; and &quot;expedites development and fielding of select Department of Defense combat support and weapon systems by leveraging defense-wide technology development efforts and existing operational capabilities.&quot; According to investigative journalist Sharon Weinberger, the author of Imaginary Weapons and A Nuclear Family Vacation, her recent piece in Popular Mechanics, revealed that prior to the Pentagon assuming ownership of the X-37 project, &quot;the spacecraft was regarded as just another experimental prototype.&quot; Today however, Weinberger wrote, &quot;Air Force officials are skittish to mention even the smallest details.&quot; When Air Force chief scientist Werner J.A. Dahm was asked by Weinberger &quot;what he could say about the X-37B,&quot; he replied, &quot;'Nothing very useful,' before quickly changing the subject.&quot; In a 2006 piece in Air Force Print News (AFPN) however, we were informed that the X-37B will &quot;will serve as a test platform for satellites and other space technologies. The vehicle allows satellite sensors, subsystems, components and associated technology to be transported into the environment where they will be used--space.&quot; With information scarce on what the OTV's current mission is, the Air Force has said that after the first few flights (a second test in slated for 2011), &quot;you get into the realm of using it as a reusable space test platform--putting space components into its experimental bay and taking them to space for testing,&quot; RCO's X-37B program manager Lt. Col. Kevin Walker told AFPN. While the Air Force has denied that the X-37B is the vanguard for a space-based system to be deployed for spying or as an orbital weapons' delivery platform, and while this may betechnically accurate in so far as the mini-shuttle is a prototype, the vagaries of the project raise intriguing questions. This is borne out by an April 22 announcement by the 45th Space Wing Public Affairs office at Patrick Air Force base. Deputy Undersecretary Payton said &quot;if these technologies on the vehicle prove to be as good as we estimate, it will make our access to space more responsive, perhaps cheaper, and push us in the vector toward being able to react to warfighter needs more quickly.&quot; This was seconded by Col. Andre Lovett, 45th Space Wing vice commander: &quot;This launch helps ensure that our warfighters will be provided the capabilities they need in the future.&quot; Nothing ambiguous in these statements as to how the USAF views the future role for the system, nor do they bear a relationship to Payton's earlier claim to reporters that the X-37B is &quot;just an updated version of the space shuttle kinds of activities in space.&quot; Weinberger notes that &quot;the most daring job of a space plane, and the one least discussed, is the role of a bomber.&quot; According to Weinberger, the X-37B &quot;could fly over targets within an hour of launch to release cone-shaped re-entry vehicles that would both protect and guide weapons through the atmosphere.&quot; Equally destabilizing, a craft such as the X-37B &quot;could carry 1000- or 2000-pound re-entry vehicles armed with precision munitions like bunker-busting penetrators or small-diameter bombs, or simply use the explosive impact of kinetic rods cratering at hypersonic speeds to destroy targets.&quot; Joan Johnson-Freese, a Professor of National Security Studies at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, told Space.comjournalist Leonard David last month that &quot;other countries&quot; will likely view the X-37B &quot;as another capability intended to assure the United States will be able to dominate access to and the use of space.&quot;<br />

One need only consider the negative international reaction to the Chinese anti-satellite (ASAT) test in January 2007, in which a Chinese ASAT destroyed a derelict Chinese satellite and created a large, hazardous, long-dwell swath of debris. The reaction to the Chinese operation stands in stark contrast to the more favorable global reaction to the United States’ <em>Operation Burnt Frost</em> in March 2008, in which a United States missile interceptor destroyed a derelict, uncontrolled, and potentially hazardous satellite. The primary differences in the two operations were the level of transparency and the resulting environmental impacts. The Chinese 26 surprised the world with their operation, were less than forthcoming about the operation, severely polluted an entire swath of the LEO environment with debris, and were perceived as <em>reckless</em>. The United States, by contrast, informed the world community weeks in advance, were very transparent with respect to operational data, conducted the operation so as to completely de-orbit the resulting debris, and, though some groups and political rivals objected, the United States was perceived as acting <em>responsibly</em>.54 Transparency and perceived intentions matter<em>.</em> The United States would be very well served by a track record of responsible stewardship in the space operating environment through careful actions that strengthen international confidence and trust. <em>Safeguarding the high frontier from the vantage of the moral high ground</em> will give the United States an advantage in the future international arena.55<br />

<em>Space Weapons: Perception and Provocation The term</em> space weaponization <em>defies precise definition; it is a matter of observed actions and perceived intent. As an inherent survival instinct, humans tend to distrust or fear those things -- in this case technologies and deployed systems -- they do not control, do not understand, or, given the first two conditions, into which they do not have, or are not afforded, insight sufficient to assuage their discomfort.51 This is an especially important issue relative to policy decisions and system deployment in the space domain, for the simple reason that the space domain is not restricted by borders, oceans, terrain, or firewalls. A single spacecraft can overfly, if so designed or directed, every point on the surface of the Earth. It should come as no surprise that the perceived presence of a</em> space-based weapon <em>in orbit can potentially evoke a visceral, negative response from the international community.52 Any action taken by the United States can have positive and negative impacts; perceptions of other nations and actors within the international security environment will vary and could present significant challenges. Articulating the details of military space efforts as</em> defensive <em>in nature may allow the United States to peacefully pursue development of advanced space technologies and methods, while safeguarding its political clout and cultural influence on the international stage.</em><br />

In response to the credible and expanding Chinese anti-satellite threat, the United States must adopt a defensive space strategy that can deter Chinese actions and then also recover ,from an attack. Some within the United States government, notably Senator Jon Kyl, have advocated an offensive deterrence strategy to counter the Chinese anti-satellite threat, creating weapons that would not only attack Chinese satellites but also anti-satellite systems.25 This policy, however, would in effect start a space arms race, a costly proposition with many high dollar systems competing for the defense budget. Offensive kinetic anti-satellite weapons, whether direct ascent or co-orbital, can create a significant debris field that could indiscriminately damage friendly satellites and ultimately hurt the United States more than China. The United States abandoned its Cold War kinetic anti-satellite program after a test where an F-15-launched missile destroyed a satellite and created a LEO debris field that took over 20 years to decay.26 However, the United States demonstrated its ability to rapidly reconstitute its direct ascent anti-satellite capability when it launched a modified Standard Missile-3 from the USS Lake Erie and destroyed a malfunctioning satellite before it could reenter and possibly impact a populated area.27 Although the United States engaged the satellite at the lower portion of the LEO regime to minimize orbital debris and provided timely notification to the international community, China criticized the operation as threatening to space security.28 This reaction supports the idea that pursuing an offensive anti-satellite program could drive a space arms race. Finally, in an anti-satellite exchange, China currently has much less to lose. China would be much less reliant on space systems to operate in a conflict.<br />

<em>Second, the United States should make developing and fielding a terrestrial and space-based surveillance architecture a national priority. Making such an architecture a reality would support any of the possible strategies proposed in the preceding section of this paper, as space surveillance will support space being protected as a sanctuary, will be required for verification of any space treaties, and would be used to provide intelligence and targeting information should the United States ultimately elect to pursue a policy of space dominance. Making a comprehensive surveillance architecture a national priority would also focus US spending precedence on only one aspect of space control (possibly postponing and/or halting development of space-based weapons as a cost offset), thereby ensuring unity of effort toward a common goal.</em><br />

<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif;">In such circumstances, America certainly would respond eventually. Conversely, if America were to weaponize space today, it is unlikely that any other state or group of states would find it rational to counter in kind. The entry cost to provide the necessary infrastructure is too high—hundreds of billions of dollars, at minimum. The years of investment needed to achieve a minimal counter-force capability—essentially from scratch—would provide more than ample time for the United States to entrench itself in space and readily counter preliminary efforts to displace it. The tremendous effort in time and resources would be worse than wasted. Most states, if not all, would opt not to counter U.S. deployments in kind. They might oppose U.S. interests with asymmetric balancing, depending on how aggressively America uses its new power, but the likelihood of a hemorrhaging arms race in space should the United States deploy weapons there—at least for the next few years—is extremely remote.</span><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">In space, you still can’t escape Washington’s debt and deficit woes. In a briefing this morning with reporters, Gregory Schulte, the Pentagon’s space policy chief, said the U.S. aimed to maintain its strategic advantage in space – but it would have to implement that strategy “in a tight budget environment.” The Department of Defense currently spends around $26 billion a year on space projects, funding that sustains a wide array of communications and surveillance satellites. Mr. Schulte said the Pentagon was looking at “different approaches” to launching and operating satellites, in hopes of saving money. As an example, Mr. Schulte pointed to the Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload, or CHIRP, an Air Force sensor assembly that will be installed on board a commercial communications satellite. Defense space policy now encourages the concept of “hosted payloads” – in other words, allowing military equipment to piggyback aboard privately funded and operated satellites. “By launching it as a payload on another satellite, the department gets considerable savings,” Mr. Schulte said. “CHIRP is costing us something like $65 million; if we would launch it as a free-flying satellite, it would cost something like $500 million.” According to Mr. Schulte, U.S. satellites need to operate in space that is increasingly “congested, contested and competitive.” That’s the Pentagon catchphrase for describing how space is crowded with more satellites and orbital debris – and how satellites are more vulnerable to attack or interference. The new national security space strategy, signed in February by former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, was in large part developed to address those three concerns. But as Mr. Schulte suggested, the military was also keeping an eye on another: cost. “We are going to have to look at innovative ways of operating and procuring capabilities,” he said. “We are maybe going to have to look at some concepts that we didn’t look at before.” </span><br />

In the decades since the space program first began, the United States has come to depend on space as indispensable in many ways. That dependence, coupled with the growing threats of other actors seeking to deny the use of this medium, creates vulnerabilities that the United States is currently ill-equipped to address. The Distributed Real-time Awareness Global Network in Space (DRAGNETS) system comprised of constellations of thousands of miniaturized femtosats is a different way of looking at space situational awareness (SSA) than our current and future planned paradigm. Furthermore, DRAGNETS represents the natural convergence of the trend toward distributed, networked military solutions and the capabilities nanotechnology will enable over the next 20 years. This convergence will have significant cost and acquisition benefits, too. Once the DRAGNETS design has matured to the point of transition to an acquisition program, the system will take advantage of substantial cost savings in several areas. The satellite-on-a-chip implementation lends itself to mass-production efficiencies that will allow entire constellations of femtosats to be produced in a very small fraction of the time it takes to integrate a large satellite from the ground up. Additionally, functional and environmental testing can be accomplished in a streamlined fashion compared to today’s roughly year-long process, using much more cost-effective facilities and requiring far fewer paid workers to support. Finally, the launch options for a distributed system are very flexible, from single-launch insertion of entire constellations to incremental build-up using space-available services. In order to get to this point the United States will need to shepherd market enthusiasm and public trust.<br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">Misperception that space “takes too long and costs too much.” Fielding space capabilities is technically challenging and costly. Nevertheless, the US has fielded the world’s highest-performing space capabilities. Just as no space professional works in the “Non-Operationally Responsive Space Office,” no part of our space enterprise wants space capabilities to cost more and take longer. Nevertheless, the misperception that space takes too long and costs too much jeopardizes the enterprise’s ability to convince others to increase the space budget to field needed additional capability. Adding responsive space capabilities to the current mix of mostly exquisite space capabilities would provide additional capability and price data points and options. These would help space leaders better explain and justify the entire space portfolio. In the communications mission area, for example, small satellites are not cost competitive with large satellites on a “per channel” basis. The analysis behind that assertion is sound and drove us to the current constellation of large satellites. Small communication satellites can be fielded rapidly and flexibly, though, making them responsive and attractive for reconstitution, spot augmentation, and other unanticipated urgent communication needs. Adding responsive space capabilities to the current space architecture mix will improve the cost and schedule “bang for the buck,” help us better justify the cost and schedule attributes of the current space architecture, or quite possibly both. </span><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">Only in recent months, when he was willing to make it his personal issue and to spend significantly from his store of political capital, was President Obama able to achieve victory in the bitter congressional battle over health care reform. Presidential greatness is combining policy and politics to win significant victories that have a major impact on the trajectory of national life. Such victories--which upset the status quo--only occur when a president takes political risks and is willing to incur short-term unpopularity with significant segments of the electorate. There have been two great Democrat presidents since FDR--Harry Truman and LBJ. Both came to office through the death of a president; both could have run for a second elected term; both declined to do so because they were extremely unpopular; but, part of their unpopularity was due to courageous decisions which required large expenditure of personal capital and which changed the course of history. Truman, now considered by historians as one of our most momentous presidents, has an astounding list of major decisions by his name: the dropping of the atomic bomb; the formation of the UN and NATO; the adoption of the Marshall Plan; the formulation of the Truman Doctrine and the strategy of &quot;containing&quot; the Soviet Union; a willingness to oppose Communist aggression in North Korea (and to fire General Douglas MacArthur); the issuance of executive orders desegregating the Armed Forces, the civil service and government contracting; recognition of the state of Israel; and promotion of the Fair Deal (which was only a mixed success but which expanded social security, the minimum wage and federal housing support). To be sure, Truman's unpopularity was also due to scandals, a war weary nation and vicious debates about who lost China. But his historical standing today is owed, in no small part, to his political courage and willingness to use up the political capital of the presidency on issues of major import. Similarly, LBJ was one of our greatest domestic presidents. Under his leadership from 1964-66, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare, Medicaid, the War on Poverty and a path-breaking elementary and secondary education act. Johnson had the courage to spend political capital on great tasks even though he, of all people, knew that his initiatives, especially on race, would split the Roosevelt coalition, drive away Southern whites, weaken the Democratic Party and put his own reelection in jeopardy. After Lincoln, Johnson is considered the president who did the most to overcome the nation's shameful history of slavery and racial discrimination and to advance the ideal of racial justice. To be sure, Johnson's unpopularity also stemmed, in important part, from his prosecution of an increasingly divisive war in South Vietnam and from a complex, domineering personality that his oleaginous rhetoric could not conceal. Yet, his place in history is secure because of courageous domestic decisions which weakened him politically. By contrast, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, the other two Democratic presidents prior to President Obama, are unlikely (even in light of more even-handed views of historians a generation from now) to enter the pantheon of greatness. President Carter's fundamental problem, oddly enough, was that he recklessly spent presidential capital in his first year in office--on reforming water projects, energy reform, welfare reform and numerous other initiatives--with limited or no success. By the end of 1977, his apolitical approach, and his serial failures, had dramatically diminished his reputation in Washington and seriously eroded his popularity in the nation. And he could never recover from his naive policy profligacy as the nation's economy began to suffer from the lethal combination of high inflation and high interest rates. By contrast, President Clinton tried one major domestic initiative early in his administration--health care--and, after being defeated on that, was either on the defensive or advanced a minimalist, safe agenda. With the Republican take-over of Congress in 1994, Clinton had to fight a rear guard action until the 1996 election. Then the Lewinski scandal and impeachment consumed much of the administration's energy, and Dick Morris's &quot;triangulation&quot; meant that Clinton took few significant political risks. Never has there been a president with as much political and policy talent, who presided over a booming economy (due, only in small part, to public policy) but whose major accomplishments were so slender. I always felt that it was a badge of dishonor for Clinton to leave office with a high approval rating for the reasons I have tried to develop here: no great deeds are possible for a president without a willingness to risk political standing. The saga of President Obama is but 14 months old. It is too soon to tell whether health care reform will be a policy succ ess in implementation and a long-term political success (like Medicare) as it changes a health care system bristling with problems. And, of course, it is far, far too soon to make any meaningful judgments about his tenure. But, after a first year of aloofness from the political fray of health care, Obama's willingness, since the Massachusetts senatorial election to push his chips on the table, take a huge political gamble, and win a major legislative victory (with uncertain short-term political consequences) echoes decisions of his great Democratic predecessors, Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson. </span><br />

As the NSP and the NSSS both highlight, <span class="Underline">the increasingly congested space environment creates a pressing need to improve our Space Situational Awareness (SSA).</span> Today we track over 20,000 objects in space – orders of magnitude more than just a few years ago. About 1,100 are active satellites and the rest are essentially debris or inactive satellites. <span class="Underline">Development and implementation of the Joint Space Operation Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) supports Air Force Space Command’s top SSA priority: to provide integrated data that gives real-time, actionable SSA allowing informed, rapid decision-making capability</span>. JMS was a new program element in FY10 that consolidated efforts from the Integrated Space Situational Awareness (ISSA), the Rapid Attack Identification Detection and Reporting System RAIDRS) Block 20, and Space Command and Control (C2) programs under a single program element. <span class="Underline">The FY12 budget request includes $119.9 million to sustain the foundational JMS infrastructure and enable further planning and development. To replace and improve the SSA capabilities of the Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS</span>), which has a planned end-of-life in 2015, the <span class="Underline">Air Force is developing the Space Fence program to provide uncued surveillance of small objects in low and medium earth orbit.</span> The ground-based radar sites that will comprise the Space Fence will provide timely information on launch detection, maneuvers and breakups to support protection of space assets. On January 26, 2011, <span class="Underline">two contracts were awarded to Lockheed Martin and Raytheon for the Preliminary Design Review portion of Phase A development</span>. The Air Force and Phase A contractors will continue to leverage development of the Navy’s AMDR S-band program, which may share certain key technologies with the Space Fence. <span class="Underline">The FY12 budget request includes $235.5 million in RDT&amp;E funding for the Space Fence, and we anticipate award of the final contract in the last quarter of the fiscal year.</span> This program is another in which we are seeking international cooperation through establishment of an SSA partnership with Australia by jointly employing and operating a space object detect and track radar in Australia. This system will provide better understanding of the current and future strategic space environment and establish a foundation for continuing nation-to-nation cooperation.<br />

While he lacks the sizzle and spark of his predecessor Trent Lott (Miss.), <span style="text-decoration: none;">Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl</span> (Ariz.) seems to have found <span style="text-decoration: none;">his niche as the Republicans’ top vote-counter by cajoling with substance </span>rather than style. And while that approach may make it difficult for outsiders to measure the Arizona Republican’s success as a Whip, co<span style="text-decoration: none;">l</span>leagues and observers <span style="text-decoration: none;">credit him with helping keep a badly battered and deeply fractured minority together as much as possible.</span> “<span style="text-decoration: none;">I would say that Sen. Kyl’s job is a heck of a lot harder than when we were in the majority or had larger numbers</span>,” <span style="text-decoration: none;">National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Cornyn (</span>Texas) <span style="text-decoration: none;">said Monday</span>, adding that while Kyl’s work may not be as obvious as some of the party’s more colorful Whips, <span style="text-decoration: none;">he is nevertheless working constantly to keep the GOP’s 41 Members together. </span>“There’s an awful lot of one-on-one communicating. ... he’s literally working it all the time,” Cornyn said. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) — who sometimes finds herself at odds with her leadership on major policy matters — agreed, saying that unlike Lott, who was a very public, vocal leader, Kyl prefers to keep a lower profile. “He’s got a way about him, a mannerism, I think that’s not aggressive, it’s not pushy. It’s, ‘come on, lets get this done,’” explained Murkowski, who serves as a counselor to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.). <span style="text-decoration: none;">Cornyn said Kyl’s focus on getting results works and helps a diminished minority [Republicans]stay close when it really matters.</span> He said Kyl needs to hold to that strategy “if he’s going to keep us together.” <span style="text-decoration: none;">Kyl easily won the job as Whip, the No. 2 in the GOP lineup, when Lott suddenly resigned his Senate seat in late 2007 to head to the private sector. Kyl had previously served as the Senate Republican Conference chairman, a job that forced him to embrace the cameras as one of the party’s top messengers. </span><br />

Last week, President Bush mentioned proposed rules to limit air pollution from coalfired power plants. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Air pollution is</span> clearly <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">an important concern. NASA has played a major role in</span> the <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">development of new technologies that can monitor the sources and circulation patterns of air pollution globally</span>. It is another tremendous story of science serving society through innovation. In this case, through an international collaboration, NASA deployed a one-of-a-kind instrument designed to observe global carbon monoxide and its transport from the NASA Terra spacecraft. These animations show the first global observations of air pollution. Sources of carbon monoxide include industrial processes (see, for example, source regions in the Pacific Rim) and fires (for example in Amazonia). These global-scale data from space have helped change our understanding of the relationship between pollution and air quality - we now know that pollution is not solely or even primarily a local or regional problem. California's air quality is influenced by industrial activity in Asia, and Europe's air quality is influenced by activities here in America. From such pioneering work, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">operational systems can</span> now <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">be designed to observe</span> pollution events, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">the global distribution of chemicals</span> and particulate matter <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">in the atmosphere</span>, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">and the ways</span> in which <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">these substances</span> interact and affect the <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">ability of the atmosphere to sustain life</span> - such a system will undoubtedly underpin future efforts to understand, monitor, and manage air quality globally. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Without NASA's commitment to innovation in the Earth sciences, it is hard to believe that such an incredible new capability would be available today</span>. The Promise of Earth Observations in the Next Decade The achievements of the last several decades have laid the foundation for an unprecedented era of discovery and innovation in Earth system science. Advances in observing technologies have been accompanied by vast improvements in computing and data processing. When the Earth Observing System satellites were being designed, processing and archiving the data was a central challenge. The Terra satellite produces about 194 gigabytes of raw data per day, which seemed a daunting prospect at the time of its definition. Now laptop memories are measured in gigabytes, students can work with remote sensing datasets on their laptops, and a large data center like NCAR increases our data holdings by about 1000 gigabytes per day. The next generation of high performance computing systems, which will be deployed during the next five years or so, will be petascale systems, meaning that they will be able to process millions of gigabytes of data. The ongoing revolution in information technology has provided us with capabilities we could hardly conceive of when the current generation of Earth observing satellites was being developed. We have just begun to take advantage of the synergies between these technological areas. The U.S., through NASA, is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this technological opportunity. Example 3: Weather Forecasting Weather forecasting in the Southern Hemisphere has been dramatically improved through NASA's contributions, and this experience illustrates the power of remote sensing for further global improvements in weather prediction. The lack of surface- based data in the Southern Hemisphere once meant that predictive skill lagged considerably behind that achieved in the Northern Hemisphere. The improvement in the accuracy of Southern Hemisphere weather forecasting is well documented and almost entirely due to the increased use of remote-sensing data. But improvements in the quality of satellite data were not sufficient. Improvements in data assimilation a family of techniques for integrating observational results into predictive models were also necessary. The combination has resulted in rapid improvement in Southern Hemisphere forecasting, which is now nearly equal to that in northern regions. Data assimilation capabilities continue to advance rapidly. One can now easily conceive of forecast systems that will fuse data from satellites, ground-based systems, databases, and models to provide predictions with unprecedented detail and accuracy - perhaps reaching natural limits of predictability. A new generation of weather forecast models with cloud-resolving spatial resolution is coming on line, and these models show significant promise for improving forecast skills across the board. Use of new NASA remote sensing data from upcoming missions such as Calipso (Cloud- Aerosol and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite) and CloudSat will be essential to fully validate and tune these new capabilities which will serve the nation in providing improved hurricane and severe storm prediction, and in the development of numerous decision support systems reliant on state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction capabilities. Example 4: Earth System Models Data from NASA missions are central to constructing more comprehensive and detailed models that will more realistically represent the complexity of the Earth system. Cloud observations from MODIS (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and precipitation measurements from GPM (the Global Precipitation Mission), for example, are critical to improving the representation of clouds and the water cycle in such models. Observations from MODIS and Landsat are fundamental to the development of more sophisticated representation of marine and terrestrial ecosystems and atmosphere-land surface interactions. The inclusion of this detail will help in the creation of true Earth system models that will enable detailed investigation of the interactions of Earth system processes and multiple environmental stresses within physically consistent simulated systems. In general terms, Earth system observations represent the only means of validating Earth system model predictions. Our confidence in short-term, regional-scale weather predictions is based on how closely they match observed regional conditions. Assessing the performance of global-scale, longer-term model predictions likewise depends on comparing model results with observational records. Scientific confidence in the ability of general circulation models to represent Earth's climate has been greatly enhanced by comparing model results for the last century with the observational records from that period. At the same time, the sparse and uneven nature of past observational records is an ongoing source of uncertainty in the evaluation of model results. The existence of much more comprehensive and consistent global measurements from space such as the data from the NASA Terra, Aqua, and Aura satellites is a giant step forward in this regard, and, if maintained, will enable much more rigorous evaluation of model performance in the future. In summary, Earth system models, with increasing temporal and spatial resolutions and validated predictive capabilities, will be used by industry and governmental decision makers across a host of domains into the foreseeable future. This knowledge base will drive new economies and efficiencies within our society. I believe that requirements flowing from the needs and capabilities of sophisticated Earth system models will be very useful for NASA in developing strategic roadmaps for future missions. C. The Importance of Careful Planning The central role of NASA in supporting Earth system science, the demonstrated success and impact of previous and current NASA missions, and the promise of continued advances in scientific understanding and societal benefits all argue for a careful, analytical approach to major modifications in the NASA Earth science program. As noted above, the development of space systems is a time-consuming and difficult process. Today's actions and plans will have long-term consequences for our nation's capabilities in this area. The link between plans and actions is one of the most important points I want to address today. From the outside, the interagency planning process seems to be experiencing substantial difficulties in maintaining this link. The NASA Earth science program is part of two major Presidential initiatives, the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). With regard to the CCSP, it is not apparent that the strategies and plans developed through the interagency process are having much impact on NASA decision-making. In January 2004, then- Administrator of NASA, Sean O'Keefe, called for acceleration of the NASA Glory mission because of the direct relevance of the mission to understanding the roles of aerosols in the climate system, which is one of the highest-priority science questions defined in the CCSP research strategy. NASA is now proposing cancellation of the mission. As I have emphasized throughout this testimony, the progress of and benefits from Earth system science research are contingent upon close coordination between research, modeling, and observations. The close coordination of program planning among the agencies that support these activities is also a necessity. This coordination currently appears to be fragile. The effect of significant redirections in NASA and reduction in NASA's Earth science effort are equally worrisome in the case of the Administration's GEOSS initiative, which is focused on improving the international coordination of environmental observing systems. Both NASA and NOAA satellite programs are vital to this effort. The science community is very supportive of the GEOSS concept and goals. There are over 100 space-based remote-sensing systems that are either operating or planned by various nations for the next decade. Collaboration among space systems, between space- and ground-based systems, and between suppliers and users of observational data is critical to avoiding duplication of effort and to getting the most out of the investments in observing technology. The tragic example of the Indian Ocean Tsunami demonstrates the need for such coordination. The tsunami was detected and observed before hitting land, but the absence of effective communication links prevented warnings from reaching those who needed them in time. A functioning GEOSS could lead to major improvements in the rapid availability of data and warnings, and the U.S. is right to make development of such a system a priority. But U.S. credibility and leadership of this initiative will be called into question if our nation is unable or unwilling to coordinate and maintain the U.S. programs that make up the core of our proposed contribution. D. Answers to Questions Posed by the Committee My testimony to this point has outlined my views on a series of key issues for the NASA Earth science program. Much of the text found above is relevant to consideration of the specific questions posed by the Committee in its letter of invitation. In this section, I provide more direct answers to these questions to the extent possible and appropriate. How should NASA prioritize currently planned and future missions? What criteria should NASA use in doing so? I believe that NASA should work with the scientific and technical community and its partner agencies to define a NASA Earth science plan that is fully compatible with the overall CCSP and GEOSS science strategies. In my view, the interaction with the scientific and technical community should include both input from and review by the National Research Council (NRC) and direct interaction with the strong national community of Earth science investigators and the aerospace industry who are very familiar with NASA capabilities and developing technological opportunities. Competitive peer review processes should be used appropriately in assessing the merit of competing approaches and in key decision- making. I believe NASA should also find a means of involving users and potential users of NASA-generated data in this process, perhaps through public comment periods or a series of workshops. Sufficient time should be allotted to this process for a careful and deliberative evaluation of options. This science plan should then guide the process of setting mission priorities. Defining criteria to use in comparing and deciding upon potential missions would be an important part of this planning exercise. I would recommend consideration of a set of criteria that include: -- compatibility with science priorities in the CCSP and GEOSS science plans -- potential scientific return from mission -- technological risk -- direct and indirect societal benefits -- cost. I believe that the decadal planning activity underway at the NRC in response to a request from NASA and NOAA is a valuable step in this process. What are the highest priority unaddressed or unanswered questions in Earth science observations from space? I believe this question is most appropriately addressed through the community process suggested above. There are many important Earth science questions, and prioritizing among them is best done in a deliberative and transparent process that involves extensive input from and discussion by the science community. I would personally cite soil moisture, three-dimensional cloud characteristics, global vector tropospheric winds, pollutant characteristics and transport, carbon fluxes, and aerosol distributions as all high priority measurements to make on a global scale. What have been the most important contributions to society that have come from NASA Earth sciences over the last decade (or two)? <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">NASA Earth science</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;"> programs have played a key role in</span> developing our understanding of the Earth as a coupled system of inter- related parts, and in the <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">identification and documentation of a series of global-scale changes in the Earth's environment, including ozone depletion</span>, land use and land cover change, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">loss of biodiversity, and climate change</span>.

What future benefits to the nation (societal applications) are possible that NASA Earth sciences could provide? What gaps in our knowledge must we fill before those future benefits are possible?

<em>From the discussion above, it is obvious the NAV requirements drive towards highly integrated subsystems with innovative configuration layouts at very low weights. New manufacturing techniques in all areas from batteries to sensors are required to achieve a NAV. This technology challenge is a key component of the DARPA NAV program which made the requirement to demonstrate a clear process to integrate other subsystems into the airframe and show the capability to manufacture the system. 13 This technology area will benefit greatly from advancements in nanoscale fabrication techniques which were predicted in the 2002 USAF Science and Technology Board report on implications of emerging micro- and nanotechnologies. 14 The predominant mission of UAVs today is primarily the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission as seen with the Predator and Global Hawk UAVs as well as the plethora of smaller UAVs currently in use by all the services. The utility of UAVs for strike missions was clearly seen with the Predator in Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM. This was such a success the Air Force followed the Predator with the development and rapid fielding of the MQ-9 Reaper which was purpose built for ISR and strike missions. 15 The advent of MAVs and NAVs in future wars can bring capabilities not seen in today’s UAVs due to advances in robotics, nanotechnology, advanced explosives, and advanced manufacturing techniques. The question becomes what missions these much smaller UAVs will be capable of executing.</em><br />

The dominant mission application area for UAVs will continue to be ISR missions; however, NAVs will enable expansion into new exploitation domains. The small stature of these vehicles combined with vertical flight and autonomous capability will enable their use in urban operations much like was portrayed in the opening vignette of this chapter. ISR operations within buildings, tunnels, caves and other formations that are currently only accessible by man will become possible for ISR exploitation with NAVs. 16 The combination of small size, precision delivery, and multi-spectral sensors will provide commanders effective ISR of areas that typically put combat soldiers or airmen at risk to exploit. NAV designs under consideration include vehicles that mimic large flying insects or very small birds that can fly and land inside buildings or tunnels and transmit images. These designs could also land and lie dormant until programmed sensors detect movement or chemical tracers of intended targets and begin transmitting data of what they found. These types of vehicles could be launched from soldiers on the ground or even from guided cluster bomb units launched from larger UAVs or manned aircraft into the region of interest. The small size of these vehicles provide natural stealth and deployed in large numbers can provide large area coverage at low cost due to their low overall acquisition costs compared to larger UAVs or manned systems. 17 NAVs combined with advanced sensors will provide commanders will unprecedented ISR flexibility. Nanotechnology could provide extremely small and accurate Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) sensors that NAVs can employ. Miniature chemical detectors the sizes of individual molecules are already under development. Each detector is purpose built to detect specific molecules or even protein markers for biological agents. These molecular or protein sensors deployed into tiny arrays carried by NAVs could provide extremely accurate detection of NBC contaminants. Deployed in swarms, these NAVs could quickly identify the type of contaminant and spread out to determine the extent of the contaminated area and report back to commanders. 18 As the sensor technologies mature, NAVs could provide commanders incredible flexibility to execute difficult ISR missions covertly with low risk to friendly forces.<br />

The United States and the world need to find new sources of clean energy. Space Solar Power gathers energy from sunlight in space and transmits it wirelessly to Earth. Space solar power can solve our energy and greenhouse gas emissions problems. Not just help, not just take a step in the right direction, but solve. Space solar power can provide large quantities of energy to each and every person on Earth with very little environmental impact. The solar energy available in space is literally billions of times greater than we use today. The lifetime of the sun is an estimated 4-5 billion years, making space solar power a truly long-term energy solution. As Earth receives only one part in 2.3 billion of the Sun's output, space solar power is by far the largest potential energy source available, dwarfing all others combined. Solar energy is routinely used on nearly all spacecraft today. This technology on a larger scale, combined with already demonstrated wireless power transmission (see 2-minute video of demo), can supply nearly all the electrical needs of our planet. Another need is to move away from fossil fuels for our transportation system. While electricity powers few vehicles today, hybrids will soon evolve into plug-in hybrids which can use electric energy from the grid. As batteries, super-capacitors, and fuel cells improve, the gasoline engine will gradually play a smaller and smaller role in transportation — but only if we can generate the enormous quantities of electrical energy we need. It doesn't help to remove fossil fuels from vehicles if you just turn around and use fossil fuels again to generate the electricity to power those vehicles. Space solar power can provide the needed clean power for any future electric transportation system. While all viable energy options should be pursued with vigor, space solar power has a number of substantial advantages over other energy sources. Advantages of Space Solar Power Unlike oil, gas, ethanol, and coal plants, space solar power does not emit greenhouse gases. Unlike coal and nuclear plants, space solar power does not compete for or depend upon increasingly scarce fresh water resources. Unlike bio-ethanol or bio-diesel, space solar power does not compete for increasingly valuable farm land or depend on natural-gas-derived fertilizer. Food can continue to be a major export instead of a fuel provider. Unlike nuclear power plants, space solar power will not produce hazardous waste, which needs to be stored and guarded for hundreds of years. Unlike terrestrial solar and wind power plants, space solar power is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in huge quantities. It works regardless of cloud cover, daylight, or wind speed. Unlike nuclear power plants, space solar power does not provide easy targets for terrorists. Unlike coal and nuclear fuels, space solar power does not require environmentally problematic mining operations. Space solar power will provide true energy independence for the nations that develop it, eliminating a major source of national competition for limited Earth-based energy resources. Space solar power will not require dependence on unstable or hostile foreign oil providers to meet energy needs, enabling us to expend resources in other ways. Space solar power can be exported to virtually any place in the world, and its energy can be converted for local needs — such as manufacture of methanol for use in places like rural India where there are no electric power grids. Space solar power can also be used for desalination of sea water. Space solar power can take advantage of our current and historic investment in aerospace expertise to expand employment opportunities in solving the difficult problems of energy security and climate change. Space solar power can provide a market large enough to develop the low-cost space transportation system that is required for its deployment. This, in turn, will also bring the resources of the solar system within economic reach.<br />

National Security Space Office, Report to the Director, 10-10-2007, “Space-Based Solar Power As an Opportunity for Strategic Security; Phase 0 Architecture Feasibility Study,” NSS, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:8215:http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/final-sbsp-interim-assessment-release-01.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/final-sbsp-interim-assessment-release-01.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/final-sbsp-interim-assessment-release-01.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:8215 --><br />
FINDING: The SBSP Study Group found that industry has stated that the #1 driver and requirement for generating industry interest and investment in developing the initial operational SBSP systems is acquiring an anchor tenant customer, or customers, that are willing to sign contracts for high‐value SBSP services. Industry is particularly interested in the possibility that the DoD might be willing to pay for SBSP services delivered to the warfighter in forward bases in amounts of 5‐50 MWe continuous, at a price of $1 or more per kilowatt‐hour. o Recommendation: The SBSP Study Group recommends that the DoD should immediately conduct a requirements analysis of underlying long‐term DoD demand for secure, reliable, and mobile energy delivery to the war‐fighter, what the DoD might be willing to pay for a SBSP service delivered to the warfighter and under what terms and conditions, and evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of various approaches to signing up as an anchor tenant customer of a commercially‐delivered service, such as the NextView acquisition approach pioneered by the National GeoSpatial‐imaging Agency. FINDING: The SBSP Study Group found that even with the DoD as an anchor tenant customer at a price of $1‐2 per kilowatt hour for 5‐50 megawatts continuous power for the warfighter, when considering the risks of implementing a new unproven space technology and other major business risks, the business case for SBSP still does not appear to close in 2007 with current capabilities (primarily launch costs). This study did not have the resources to adequately assess the economic viability of SBSP given current or projected capabilities, and this must be part of any future agenda to further develop this concept. Past investigations of the SBSP concept have indicated that the costs are dominated by costs of installation, which depend on the cost of launch (dollars per kilogram) and assembly and on how light the components can be made (kilograms per kilowatt). Existing launch infrastructure cannot close the business case, and any assessment made based upon new launch vehicles and formats are speculative. Greater clarity and resolution is required to set proper targets for technology development and private capital engagement. Ideally SBSP would want to be cost‐competitive with other baseload suppliers in developing markets which cannot afford to spend a huge portion of their GDP on energy (4c/kWh), and these requirements are extremely stringent, but other niche export markets may provide more relaxed criteria (35c/kWh), and some customers, such as DoD, appear to be spending more than $1/kWh in forward deployed locations. It would be helpful to develop a series of curves which examine technology targets for various markets, in addition to the sensitivities and opportunities for development. Some work by the European Space Agency (ESA) has suggested that in an “apples‐to‐apples” comparison, SBSP may already be competitive with large‐scale terrestrial solar baseload power. A great range of opinions were expressed during the study regarding the near‐term profitability. It is instructive to note that that there are American companies that have or are actively marketed SBSP at home and abroad, while another group feels the technology is sufficiently mature to create a dedicated public‐private partnership based upon the COMSAT model and has authored draft legislation to that effect. The business case is much more likely to close in the near future if the U.S. Government agrees to: o Sign up as an anchor tenant customer, and o Make appropriate technology investment and risk‐reduction efforts by the U.S. Government, and o Provide appropriate financial incentives to the SBSP industry that are similar to the significant incentives that Federal and State Governments are providing for private industry investments in other clean and renewable power sources. • The business case may close in the near future with appropriate technology investment and risk‐reduction efforts by the U.S. Government, and with appropriate financial incentives to industry. Federal and State Governments are providing significant financial incentives for private industry investments in other clean and renewable power sources. o Recommendation: The SBSP Study Group recommends that in order to reduce risk and to promote development of SBSP, the U.S. Government should increase and accelerate its investments in the development and demonstration of key component, subsystem, and system level technologies that will be required for the creation of operational and scalable SBSP systems. Finding: The SBSP Study Group found that a small amount of entry capital by the US Government is likely to catalyze substantially more investment by the private sector. This opinion was expressed many times over from energy and aerospace companies alike. Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence that even the activity of this interim study has already provoked significant activity by at least three major aerospace companies. Should the United States put some dollars in for a study or demonstration, it is likely to catalyze significant amounts of internal research and development. Study leaders likewise heard that the DoD could have a catalytic role by sponsoring prizes or signaling its willingness to become the anchor customer for the product. These findings are consistent with the findings of the recent President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) report which recommended the federal government “expand its role as an early adopter in order to demonstrate commercial feasibility of advanced energy technologies.”<br />

So why, if SSP is so feasible, and given the current energy crisis, has none of the world’s space agencies chosen to fund a technology demonstration mission? John Mankins, former Nasa engineer and now President of the Space Power Association told E&amp;T that SSP represents “a classic conundrum” in that “energy agencies don’t do space, and space agencies don’t do energy”. Of course, the idea of a demonstrator is to prove the technology works, which is where EADS Astrium’s proposal for a demonstration satellite comes in. Based on the AlphaSat platform currently under development by a European consortium, it would provide up to 20kW of DC power from its solar arrays. According to Astrium’s chief technical officer Robert Laine, recent advances in solar cell efficiency and laser technology in Europe have brought the idea much closer to reality. Indeed, Astrium has been working with its subsidiary, Surrey Satellite Technology, “on converters that would transform the laser signal into energy”, meaning that most of the required technology is available ‘in-house’. EADS has made it clear that the demonstration will not go ahead without partners – space agencies, national governments or even power companies – to help fund the project. Nevertheless, foreseeing the need for “a group of partners from across both the energy and space sectors”, Matthew Perren, Astrium’s innovation manager, confirmed that “Astrium has received many expressions of interest from a number of potential partners, both institutional and commercial”. A proposal for a solar power satellite announced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in 2008 has a similar goal, with a more powerful 10MW demonstrator planned for 2020, but the agency also hopes to be able to deliver a gigawatt from space by 2030. Although researchers have made progress in demonstrating an 800W optical-fibre laser and mirrors that reflect light efficiently at 1µm – a frequency chosen for its ability to pass through the atmosphere with limited attenuation – some other reported numbers make the project look like science fiction. Kilometre-long solar panels, spacecraft masses in the thousands of tonnes, and price tags in the “tens of billions” make an operational system seem further away than the elusive fusion reactor. With launches of five-tonne satellites currently costing upwards of $50m, “the cost of launch is certainly a hurdle”, confirms Mankins. “However, launch costs are driven by markets more than anything else,” he says, and launches are so expensive because there are so few of them per year. In fact, in Mankins’s opinion, the emergence of a large new commercial market for launches, such as SSP, “will bring down the cost dramatically of getting to space”.<br />

For the DoD specifically, beamed energy from space in quantities greater than 5 MWe has the potential to be a disruptive game changer on the battlefield. SBSP and its enabling wireless power transmission technology could facilitate extremely flexible “energy on demand” for combat units and installations across an entire theater, while significantly reducing dependence on vulnerable over-land fuel deliveries. SBSP could also enable entirely new force structures and capabilities such as ultra long-endurance airborne or terrestrial surveillance or combat systems to include the individual soldier himself [themselves]. More routinely, SBSP could provide the ability to deliver rapid and sustainable humanitarian energy to a disaster area or to a local population undergoing nation-building activities. SBSP could also facilitate base “islanding” such that each installation has the ability to operate independent of vulnerable ground-based energy delivery infrastructures. In addition to helping American and allied defense establishments remain relevant over the entire 21st Century through more secure supply lines, perhaps the greatest military benefit of SBSP is to lessen the chances of conflict due to energy scarcity by providing access to a strategically secure energy supply.<br />

Thus, an easily accessible tax base has long been available for spending much more on international security than recent governments have been willing to contemplate. Negotiating the landmines ban, discouraging trade in small arms, promoting the United Nations arms register are all worthwhile, popular activities that polish the national self-image. But they should all be supplements to, not substitutes for, a proportionately equitable commitment of resources to the management and prevention of international conflict – and thus the containment of the WMD threat. Future American governments will not ‘police the world’ alone. For almost fifty years the Soviet threat compelled disproportionate military expenditures and sacrifice by the United States. That world is gone. Only by enmeshing the capabilities of the United States and other leading powers in a co-operative security management regime where the burdens are widely shared does the world community have any plausible hope of avoiding warfare involving nuclear or other WMD.<br />

As outlined in Air University study Spacecast 2020, the rapid launch and deployment of satellites is required to comply with the United States National Military Strategy concept of reconstitution. Reconstitution for space is the ability to launch satellites for “unanticipated system failures … [due to hostile actions] and multiple area coverage requirements, [which] … require the immediate placement of satellites into orbit.” 21 Solar power satellites enable reconstitution with unmanned aerial vehicles performing the same functions as satellites, as mentioned previously, and through enabling smaller satellites. One of the difficulties in achieving small satellites is the fact that power generation takes up about 25% of the weight of a satellite. 22 Satellites launched without onboard power generation would be smaller and receive power on orbit from a solar power satellite. Solar power satellites enable reconstitution with unmanned aerial vehicles with unlimited loiter time for immediate deployment for a warfighter, and by reducing the size of satellites which facilitates rapid launches. Small Satellites Small satellites not only fulfill the reconstitution requirement but also meet other requirements for smaller, faster, and cheaper satellites. Typically weighing less than 250 kg, and designed for one mission, “quick checkout and rapid launch,” small satellites offer advantages over larger satellites, which are more expensive, cost more to put in orbit, and take longer to build. 23 Small satellites are good candidates for imagery, and some types of communications. 24 Constellations of small satellites serve another purpose. They have reduced vulnerability and increased survivability compared to single satellites. Powering small satellites with energy beamed from a solar power satellite further reduces their size, cost, and launch requirements. Maneuver One of the vulnerabilities of satellites is that they lack maneuverability. Orbit changes are possible but the amount of station keeping fuel limits these maneuvers. Unscheduled orbital maneuvers for, supported warfighters, on-orbit station keeping, or avoiding an anti-satellite weapon, reduce the life expectancy of satellites. The New World Vistas study concluded, “technologies to substantially enhance survivability are …maneuvering technologies…enabled by the technologies of high generation power in space.” 25 Moreover, the report stated that electrical propulsion and solar power satellites would enable maneuvering for survivability, station keeping, and repositioning to meet warfighter requirements.<br />

Greater situational awareness through enhanced monitoring and surveillance in space is also crucial to this idea of defense in space. One of<br />
<hr />
De<br />
the driving forces behind China’s efforts to research space debris identification and tracking is to also improve China’s ability to monitor military assets.68 The ability to identify and discriminate objects in space is crucial to evaluating threats from non-threats in space. The above constitute ‘comprehensive defensive actions,’ centered on capabilities to enhance survivability of China’s satellite networks, and ensure China’s access to space that is considered indispensable for future ‘informationalized warfare.’69 At the heart of this defensive strategy is the need to protect against an adversary’s ability to prevent or restrict China from using space to its economic and national security advantage; that is, the ability to ‘deny the denial.’ It is the dual-use nature of China’s satellite program that will provide the means to achieve that comprehensive defense in space. For example, China’s plan to increase indigenous development and production capacity of durable and miniaturized satellites for missions of data transmission and Earth remote sensing is aimed primarily at civilian and commercial purposes. However, such technologies offer lower cost access to space with greater maneuverability and thus would have a direct impact on military space capability. China also intends to increase its capacity to launch on demand and achieve launch redundancy,70 which also could markedly enhance its military space potential. Chinese slogans such as ‘applying military to civilian,’ and ‘integrating military and civilian’ are used in official discussions to stress the integration and embedding of military with civilian technology development and production.71 Since the early 1990s, the revolution in military affairs has been the central theme for China’s military modernization program, of which space is an indispensable part.72 Such notions indicate the importance of a dual-use strategy. As for existent capabilities in space, although there is no official admission, China does have satellites for navigation, remote sensing, reconnaissance and communication that have military uses.73 These are mainly for ‘power enhancement and support’ capabilities. However, as others have noted, they remain vastly insufficient for gaining any real advantage vis-à-vis U.S. dominance in space74. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the number of these assets would Eric Hagt ~95~ grow substantially under the planned satellite development program and thus rapidly improve China’s force enabling capacity.<br />

As early as 1996, General Joseph Ashy , CinC US Space Command told ‘Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology’ …. “Its politically sensitive …but its going to happen …some people do not want to hear this , but absolutely we are going to fight in Space , we’re getting to fight from space and we’re going to fight into space.” One analysis rightly concludes “that the US ( TCC ) is gearing up for the unilateral (military ) control of Space which over arches Planet Earth , all occupants and its entire contents --- with that vantage position it could overpower every opponent .” In chasing profits they boast of ‘blowing up the world,’ if necessary . However, there is many a slip, as the saying goes, between the cup and the slip . Post 2007 with the gathering financial implosion and indebtedness and loss of manufacturing capacity of the US system gathering visible momentum , the end game may turn out differently! According to some think tanks , only a few years ago , they declared that …. “Other nations lack the money and / or technology to compete with the US in the developing of space age weapons , Friedman is quoted for instance ,…..that China and Russia were passing blips.” In fact China, and to a lesser extent Russia , are the bankrupt US Treasury’s creditors ….China has been indirectly financing the Corporate wars in Afghanistan and Iraq…the US global military presence and the US Space Command’s growing dreams . But illusions can be dangerous by sparking off an uncontrolled arms Race in Space with its attendant risks and unexpected consequences that may blow up planet earth, notwithstanding the fact that the US economy is in terminal decline while its corporate warriors of the Transnational capitalist class profit and retain their wealth and riches in diverse financial securities , albeit toxic ones like Derivatives , CDOs and CDSs and other commercial paper in a huge ponzi web of deceit. We are indeed as the Chinese say living in interesting times. As US Space Command’s drives ahead with building Space WMD systems and synergizing with Ballistic Missile Defense , National Missile Defense and Anti-Satellite ( ASAT ) weapon sysytems , China and Russia will enter with defensively oriented systems and if China does , India will follow and Pakistan too . The whole game is counter –productive and result in more ‘Mutually Assured Destruction’ ( MAD ) as with nuclear weapons ….but not in the minds of the Transnational capitalist class which loves the Midas touch . The ‘Outer Space Treaty 1967 , was signed and sealed by the US , Soviet Union , China and India among others . The Outer Space treaty is a legally binding instrument . however it has a caveat ,which by omission permits the ‘passive military use of space .’ The Prime Ministers of Canada and Russia at the Millenium Summit in September 2000 and again in a meeting in December 2000 promised to work in close cooperation to prevent an arms race in Space. In a well reasoned paper presented to a Conference on Disarmament in Space , held in Moscow in 2001 , Dr Rebecca Johnson , Executive Director of the Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy called for a step by step ‘Ottawa Process’ and referred to a constructive working paper tabled by France at the Conference on Disarmament ( CD ) in Geneva. Dr Rebecca Johnson also suggested that a number of American companies with interests in Telecom , Navigation and Entertainment industries have a stake in keeping Space peaceful . She made another relevant observation that ‘Demilitarisation of Space is linked to ‘Demilitarisation of International Relations.’ Recalling Srilanka’s contribution to a proposed moratorium on testing ASAT weapons and for a discussion on a ‘Rules of the Road’ for Space in an attempt to pre-empt weaponisation of Space; the Srilankan ambassador to the CD , Geneva , Jayantha Dhanapala , as early as 1985, emphasized with rare foresight that “preventing an arms race in outer space is an easier task than attempting to control and decelerate such a race after it has begun... therefore, the urgency, to prohibit through multi-lateral negotiations the stationing of weapons in space designed to damage , destroy or interfere with any country’s space craft.” It would be ideal if the BMD and NMD projects are also halted , if not on the realization of their practical futility , then simply because the coming ‘Greatest Depression’ must lead to a major review and recall on grounds of financial non-feasibility alone. An eminent thinker and analyst in the global network for preservation of the space sanctuary has spoken thus : “ It wont do much good to anti-war people to demand an end to the war in Iraq, Afghanistan , nuclear war , weaponisation of Space ….unless they ( we ) mobilize the millions to demand the end of the underlying system , profit is all the human being nothing, that has now produced quasi-permanent war , conflict, violence, tension and sectarian strife (death squads and PMC personnel masquerading as Special Operation Groups with remote control drone bombers outside the control of any democratic institution of the State system / apparatus .)” We are threatened with the destruction and decimation of peoples and nations the world over , including the destruction of the life-sustaining resources of mother earth .<br />

<em>There is an escalating climate crisis that is stressing the Earth’s environment. It is partially a result of the increasing accumulation of carbon dioxide and methane greenhouse gases in the lower atmosphere. One area that is significantly affected is the water infrastructure around the planet including hydropower, flood defense, drainage, and irrigation systems. The effect of adverse climate change on freshwater systems aggravates population growth, weakening economic conditions, land‐use changes, and urbanization. In the western U.S., for example, reduced water supplies plus increased demand are likely to provoke more interstate and urban–rural com‐ petition for over‐allocated water resources. Seawater desalination has existed for decades and is a proven technology for supplying water in coastal areas. Continued population growth in coastal areas makes it economically feasible to begin considering seawater desalination as a larger source for metropolitan water supplies. Fresh water reclaimed from seawater is 15‐50% efficient depending upon the production process, which can be osmosis, distillation, or a hybrid of both. Offshore oil and gas platforms already use seawater desalination to produce fresh water for platform personnel and equipment. We propose, as California coastal oil and gas platforms come to the end of their productive lives, that they be re‐commissioned for use as large‐scale fresh water production facilities. Solar ar‐ rays, mounted on the platforms, are able to provide the power needed for seawater desalination during the daytime. However, for efficient fresh water production, including on oil platforms, a facil‐ ity must be operated 24 hours a day. We propose the use of solar power transmitted from orbiting satellites (Solar Power Satellites – SPS) to substantially augment the solar array power generated from natural sunlight. The advantage of a SPS in geo‐ synchronous orbit (GEO) is that it is able to produce power at nighttime, thus ena‐ bling 24 hours a day operations. A SPS would be conceptually similar to existing commercial communication satellites but with a much larger solar array. A single satellite could power at least one seawater distillation plant on a converted offshore oil platform during the night and supplement the power during the day to provide clean energy and water for urban or agricultural on‐shore areas. The center beam power from a SPS received at Earth’s surface is about ½ Sun. Production of industrial quantities of fresh water on re‐commissioned oil and gas platforms, using energy transmitted from solar power satellites, is a break­ through concept for addressing the pressing climate, water, and economic issues of the 21st Century. It is a novel combination of mature technologies that provides new so‐ lutions. As such, we recommend sponsored, expert team feasibility studies to evalu‐ ate this vision for producing fresh water using space power.</em><br />

<em>SPS is key to power fresh water distillation centers 24 hours a day—GEO specifically is key</em><br />

The use of solar arrays to generate power for seawater desalination is not a new idea nor is the idea of using heat flow tubes as part of the distillation process. Solar arrays are coupled with seawater desalination and are used in the eastern Mediter‐ ranean and Persian Gulf regions. The prime disadvantages of using solar arrays are that solar energy is limited to approximately half a day (no solar power at night) and seasonal Sun angles can further reduce solar array efficiency. In addition, clouds re‐ duce power from solar arrays. If fresh water production were implemented using an offshore platform, solar arrays are the best method to generate electrical power for either RO or distillation processes. We describe below a way in which solar arrays can be augmented on off‐ shore oil and gas platforms to achieve efficiency in fresh water production.<br />
For efficient fresh water production, a facility must be operated continuously, 24 hours a day. We propose the use of solar power from orbiting satellites (Solar Power Satellites – SPS) as a method to substantially increment the solar array power that is generated naturally from sunlight. SPS systems have been conceived and designed for nearly 4 decades but not yet demonstrated. The design concept is straightforward – use a large solar array struc‐ ture in space, collect the electrical power needed to power a microwave or laser transmitter on the spacecraft, direct the beam to a solar array receiving antenna at the Earth’s surface that is sensitive to the beam’s microwave or laser frequency, and convert the received power at the Earth solar array into electricity. The advantage of a SPS in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) is that it is able to produce power 24 hours a day and, thus, power can be transmitted at night to the surface of the Earth. Minor outages of up to approximately an hour per day over a 2‐week period occur twice a year during the spring and fall equinoxes.<br />
Historically, SPS were envisioned for providing large‐scale electricity to towns or small cities. This is based on the fact that a single kilometer‐wide band of space at GEO experiences nearly enough solar flux in one year to equal the amount of energy contained within all known recoverable conventional oil reserves on Earth today. The size of an orbital solar array is still technically prohibitive to provide power for cities. However, our concept would use a satellite that is conceptually similar to ex‐ isting commercial communication satellites but with a much larger solar array7 . For comparison, the International Space Station (ISS) has a completed total power of 120 kW using 16 solar panels of approximately 5600 m2 . A 2 MW SPS would require approximately 16 times the number of solar panels as the ISS, i.e., a configuration that is certainly much larger and technically challenging, but not unfeasible. A single 2MW‐class satellite can provide power for a Santa Barbara‐class seawater distilla‐ tion plant on a converted offshore platform during the night and can supplement the power for operations during the day. Inefficiencies in the system are not considered here. SPS power received at the Earth’s surface is about ½ Sun in the center of the beam, day and night. Added to the normal daily solar power, this can provide enough power to run fresh water production facilities.<br />

<em>For centuries war and conflict has been tied to the protection of water resources. With the risk of water shortages around the world becoming more and more of an issue, water has become the fuel of certain conflicts in many regions around the world. “Water Wars” are becoming inevitable in the world's future as the misuse of water resources continues among countries that share the same water source. International law has proven itself inadequate in defending the equal use of shared water supplies in some parts of the world (Darwish, Middle East Water Wars). The rapid population increase has greatly affected the amount of water readily available to many people.</em><br />
<em>Water as a resource is very comparable to oil; it is essential to all daily human activities. Water is becoming a very valuable commodity, yet freshwater resources are unevenly distributed among developing countries. This scarcity in water has triggered desperation in countries that already have little access to water, let alone reliable water supplies. This desperation usually cannot be resolved by negotiations. If governments or rebels want water badly enough, they resort to force to obtain it. Water has very rarely been the main ingredient in international conflicts, but it is often factored into the problem due to its economic importance. (Peter Gledick, Water Conflict Chronology)</em><br />

Many regions around the world deal with shortages of water. However, some areas deal more with conflicts over inadequate water supplies and disputes over shared water supplies. In regions where countries compete for access to water, the relations between the countries are likely to be unstable. In regions where water supply is scarce, combat sometimes seems to be the only way to resolve the problem. It is estimated that there are 1,250 square kilometers of freshwater remaining in the world’s semi-arid and arid regions and this supply is not evenly distributed among two or more countries sharing the same water source. Severe water scarcity is strongest in the Middle East and Northern Africa. The need for water in these regions is essential for food production used in irrigation farming (Klare). Water systems usually arise in one country and pass through others before reaching the sea or oceans. The rivers and lakes that come off these larger water systems are typically shared by more than one country. The states where these systems originated tend to try and gain the most control over the water. This is the case along river systems like the Nile, the Tigris-Euphrates, and the Jordan River (Klare).<br />
<br />
We will isolate three scenarios<br />
The Middle east: Water is scare and a national security imperative, causes several scenarios for conflict<br />

<em>Middle East conflicts are usually tied in the media to religion or oil, but water has become a major factor in recent disputes. In prominent watersheds such as the Jordan River Basin and the Tigris-Euphrates Basin, water supplies can be critical especially when they are being shared among multiple countries. These rivers play a very important role in the agriculture and economic development of these states. Jordan River Basin The area of the Jordan River Basin, including parts of Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Jordan, and the West Bank, is primarily an arid region. The river originates in Lebanon and has a total average flow of 1,200 million cubic meters per year. This river system consists of the Jordan and Yarmuk River, which flows from Syria. With the arid climate and low precipitation in this region, water has become the most valuable resource (Klare). Most countries in the Jordan River Basin are among some of the poorest countries in the region. Groundwater aquifers are the principle source for water supplies to the states that rely on the Jordan River. Water use varies throughout the region. Israel uses the greatest amount of water available in the basin, and next in line is Jordan. The Israeli-occupied West Bank uses the smallest amount. The daily amount of water per person in the Jordan River Basin is the lowest in the world (Water Scarcity in Jordan River Basin). The patterns of water use, overuse, and political territorial issues are resulting in disagreement over water distribution. The increase in population (both through natural increase and Israeli settlements) has led to significant challenges in managing limited water supplies. Without the existence of a legitimate water sharing agreement, the countries of Syria and Israel have taken over the water supplies. The construction of reservoirs on the Yarmuk River has caused the reduction of discharge into the Jordan River (The Jordan River Basin). The Mountain Aquifer underneath the West Bank is a point of contention between Israelis and Palestinians. Issues include the domination of groundwater supplies by the Israeli state and settlers, and the walling off of Palestinian access to water supplies. Compared to Israeli settlers Palestinians are charged three times the cost for water that comes from under the West Bank (Villiers).</em><br />
<em>The Tigris-Euphrates Basin The scarcity of water supplies in the river basin of ancient Mesopotamia has long fed disagreement among neighboring nations. The Tigris and Euphrates rivers originate in Turkey, and their watershed covers a much larger area than the Jordan River basin. The river system is shared by several countries and ethnic groups who regularly disagree on water issues. Like the Jordan River Valley, rising population in these areas is heavily affecting the availability of water. The Tigris and Euphrates are especially important to Syria and Iraq. Syria obtains approximately 85 percent of the renewable water supply while Iraq obtains 100 percent from the combination of both rivers (Klare). The Turks (and the Kurds who live in southeastern Turkey) are less dependent on the rivers, yet they still have plans for irrigation schemes to increase their utilization of both rivers. Along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, conflict arises from north to south. The downstream states of Iraq and Syria depend heavily on these two rivers for their water supply. Dams along the rivers installed by Turkey have prevented some of the water from flowing downstream to these warmer, drier countries.(Haftendorn). All three countries (but mainly Turkey) have constructed dams on the rivers for purposes of agriculture, hydroelectric power and industrialization. Turkey and Syria have increased hostilities towards one another over the use of the Euphrates River. Turkey’s plans to utilize its portion of the Euphrates have affected the share going to Syria for irrigation purposes. Hostilities between Syria and Iraq escalated due to the filling of Lake Assad by Syria, resulting to the reduction of downstream flow in the 1970’s. Iraqi’s began accusing Syria of holding back water supplies. Among all three countries, the water supply conflict is equated with their national security (Tigris Euphrates Dispute).</em><br />

<em>Middle east war goes global and nuclear</em><br />

<em>The Middle East conflict is unparalleled in terms of its potential for spreading globally. During the Cold War, amid which the Arab-Israeli conflict evolved, the two opposing superpowers directly supported the conflicting parties: the Soviet Union supported Arab countries, while the United States supported Israel. On the one hand, the bipolar world order which existed at that time objectively played in favor of the escalation of the Middle East conflict into a global confrontation. On the other hand, the Soviet Union and the United States were not interested in such developments and they managed to keep the situation under control. The behavior of both superpowers in the course of all the wars in the Middle East proves that. In 1956, during the Anglo-French-Israeli military invasion of Egypt (which followed Cairo’s decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company) the United States – contrary to the widespread belief in various countries, including Russia – not only refrained from supporting its allies but insistently pressed – along with the Soviet Union – for the cessation of the armed action. Washington feared that the tripartite aggression would undermine the positions of the West in the Arab world and would result in a direct clash with the Soviet Union. Fears that hostilities in the Middle East might acquire a global dimension could materialize also during the Six-Day War of 1967. On its eve, Moscow and Washington urged each other to cool down their “clients.” When the war began, both superpowers assured each other that they did not intend to get involved in the crisis militarily and that that they would make efforts at the United Nations to negotiate terms for a ceasefire. On July 5, the Chairman of the Soviet Government, Alexei Kosygin, who was authorized by the Politburo to conduct negotiations on behalf of the Soviet leadership, for the first time ever used a hot line for this purpose. After the USS Liberty was attacked by Israeli forces, which later claimed the attack was a case of mistaken identity, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson immediately notified Kosygin that the movement of the U.S. Navy in the Mediterranean Sea was only intended to help the crew of the attacked ship and to investigate the incident. The situation repeated itself during the hostilities of October 1973. Russian publications of those years argued that it was the Soviet Union that prevented U.S. military involvement in those events. In contrast, many U.S. authors claimed that a U.S. reaction thwarted Soviet plans to send troops to the Middle East. Neither statement is true. The atmosphere was really quite tense. Sentiments both in Washington and Moscow were in favor of interference, yet both capitals were far from taking real action. When U.S. troops were put on high alert, Henry Kissinger assured Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that this was done largely for domestic considerations and should not be seen by Moscow as a hostile act. In a private conversation with Dobrynin, President Richard Nixon said the same, adding that he might have overreacted but that this had been done amidst a hostile campaign against him over Watergate. Meanwhile, Kosygin and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko at a Politburo meeting in Moscow strongly rejected a proposal by Defense Minister Marshal Andrei Grechko to “demonstrate” Soviet military presence in Egypt in response to Israel’s refusal to comply with a UN Security Council resolution. Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev took the side of Kosygin and Gromyko, saying that he was against any Soviet involvement in the conflict. The above suggests an unequivocal conclusion that control by the superpowers in the bipolar world did not allow the Middle East conflict to escalate into a global confrontation. After the end of the Cold War, some scholars and political observers concluded that a real threat of the Arab-Israeli conflict going beyond regional frameworks ceased to exist. However, in the 21st century this conclusion no longer conforms to the reality. The U.S. military operation in Iraq has changed the balance of forces in the Middle East. The disappearance of the Iraqi counterbalance has brought Iran to the fore as a regional power claiming a direct role in various Middle East processes. I do not belong to those who believe that the Iranian leadership has already made a political decision to create nuclear weapons of its own. Yet Tehran seems to have set itself the goal of achieving a technological level that would let it make such a decision (the “Japanese model”) under unfavorable circumstances. Israel already possesses nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles. In such circumstances, the absence of a Middle East settlement opens a dangerous prospect of a nuclear collision in the region, which would have catastrophic consequences for the whole world. The transition to a multipolar world has objectively strengthened the role of states and organizations that are directly involved in regional conflicts, which increases the latter’s danger and reduces the possibility of controlling them. This refers, above all, to the Middle East conflict. The coming of Barack Obama to the presidency has allayed fears that the United States could deliver a preventive strike against Iran (under George W. Bush, it was one of the most discussed topics in the United States). However, fears have increased that such a strike can be launched by Israel, which would have unpredictable consequences for the region and beyond. It seems that President Obama’s position does not completely rule out such a possibility.</em><br />

In many parts of Africa, water shortages are a part of everyday life. Many countries share one water resource for the use both of their populations. A large percentage of these countries are very dependant on the weather to provide proper irrigation to the agricultural industry, since water resources are so scarce. The major areas being shared among countries are the Nile River, Volta River, Zambezi River, and the Niger Basin. Conflicts rage from the privatization of the water resources to the many people displaced by dams along the rivers, and the unequal distribution of water supplies amongst neighboring countries. With the growing demand for water resources, conflicts seems almost inevitable, especially with many African governments' history of poor management of resources and inadequate conflict resolution mechanisms.<br />

The Rabid Tiger Project believes that a nuclear war is most likely to start in Africa. Civil wars in the Congo (the country formerly known as Zaire), Rwanda, Somalia and Sierra Leone, and domestic instability in Zimbabwe, Sudan and other countries, as well as occasional brushfire and other wars (thanks in part to &quot;national&quot; borders that cut across tribal ones) turn into a really nasty stew. We've got all too many rabid tigers and potential rabid tigers, who are willing to push the button rather than risk being seen as wishy-washy in the face of a mortal threat and overthrown. Geopolitically speaking, Africa is open range. Very few countries in Africa are beholden to any particular power. South Africa is a major exception in this respect - not to mention in that she also probably already has the Bomb. Thus, outside powers can more easily find client states there than, say, in Europe where the political lines have long since been drawn, or Asia where many of the countries (China, India, Japan) are powers unto themselves and don't need any &quot;help,&quot; thank you. Thus, an African war can attract outside involvement very quickly. Of course, a proxy war alone may not induce the Great Powers to fight each other. But an African nuclear strike can ignite a much broader conflagration, if the other powers are interested in a fight. Certainly, such a strike would in the first place have been facilitated by outside help - financial, scientific, engineering, etc. Africa is an ocean of troubled waters, and some people love to go fishing.<br />

As population growth and climate change increase competition for water around the world, India and Pakistan may find water a growing source of conflict, analysts say. The two South Asian countries have a long history of tensions over issues as diverse as terrorist attacks and rights to Kashmir. Diplomatic initiatives have helped reduced these tensions in recent years. But given that India and Pakistan share numerous rivers, some experts think that the issue of water supplies could lead to renewed conflict, making water conservation an even more urgent priority. Water is clearly in increasingly short supply in India and Pakistan. Per capita water availability in Pakistan has fallen by nearly 75 percent over the last 60 years, in part because of rapid population growth. The country is seen as having too few dams and reservoirs to hold water supplies, and agricultural production is threatened by a lack of water. Nasim A. Khan, an academic and former secretary of Pakistan’s Alternative Energy Development Board, sees the territorial dispute between Pakistan and India over Kashmir as in part a fight for water resources, and is concerned by India’s construction of dams in the part of the territory that it controls. “The roots of the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus (rivers) are in Kashmir, and any foul play can create tremendous differences,” Khan said, referring to India’s construction of dams on these rivers over the past two decades. DRYING RIVERS Khan maintains India has depleted water supplies from two rivers, the Ravi and Sutlej, which have their sources in India but flow into north-east Pakistan, as well as from the Beas, an Indian tributary of the Sutlej. “The Sutlej and Beas are already dry, and the Ravi is partially dry. All water is being stopped in India,” Khan said. The Indus Water Treaty, signed by Pakistan and India in 1960, reserves the waters of the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus for Pakistan, while the Ravi and Sutlej are reserved for India India’s dam building in Kashmir, however, has raised suspicions in Pakistan that it is taking an unfair share of the waters of the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus, Khan said. “India continues to violate this treaty by consuming more water and building dams. Pakistan has raised this concern with the World Bank,” he said. Indian officials maintain they are operating within the boundaries of the Indus Water Treaty, though the treaty is widely viewed within Pakistan as favouring India. World Bank mediation of one dispute over dam building was decided in 2007 in India’s favour. Pakistan is constructing several dams of its own on rivers in the area of Kashmir that it controls, as well as in the country’s northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Paul Brown, a British journalist who has written books on climate issues, says the governments of countries such as India and Pakistan need to keep water from becoming one more weapon in their geopolitical rivalries. “They need to regard water as a precious resource and a human right that has to be shared between nations,” Brown said. In part, this is to set a good example to the people most affected by potential water shortages. “If supplies run low for irrigation or drinking water, local populations are likely to take the law into their own hands and grab what water is available.

Goes nuclear and causes extinction<br />
Reville 10 (William, Associate Prof. Biochem. and Public Awareness Science Officer – University College Cork, Irish Times, “Nuclear Winter Weather Forecast”, 2/4, L/N)<br />
You might think that the probability of nuclear winter has all but disappeared now that the Cold War has ended. Unfortunately not. Nuclear arsenals have grown in many countries and the prospect of regional nuclear conflicts is all too real. Recent calculations, described by Alan Robock and Owen B Toon in Scientific American, January 2010, demonstrate that even a regional nuclear war could precipitate global nuclear winter. Nuclear winter, you will recall, develops as follows. Nuclear explosions ignite massive fire-storms, causing smoke to rise high into the atmosphere to be carried around the globe. This smoke blots out the sun, causing darkness and permanent freezing. Plants cannot grow, food production quickly fails and billions die. Civilisation is destroyed and, possibly, all humans die. This scenario has been carefully studied and nuclear winter is the mature prediction of mainstream science. Since the end of the Cold War, America and Russia have greatly reduced their arsenals, but they still retain considerable nuclear weaponry. Nine countries have nuclear weapons and they are ranked as follows in order of the number of warheads they possess: Russia (15,000), US (9,900), France (350), China (200), UK (200), Israel (80), Pakistan (60), India (50), North Korea (10+). In addition, Iran may be developing nuclear weapons. There is a real possibility of nuclear war between India and Pakistan and Robock and Toon have evaluated the consequences. They assume that such a warwould quickly escalate out of control, with the deployment of full nuclear arsenals on both sides. They reason as follows: Pakistan is a small country and could be easily overrun and immobilised by Indian conventional forces. Pakistan would be tempted to release its nuclear arsenal before being overrun and India would respond in kind. They assume that each side would drop 50 bombs on major cities and industrial areas each about the size of the one dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. The authors estimate that 20 million would die immediately from direct blast, fire and radiation. Seven million metric tons of smoke would then rise up through the atmosphere (troposphere) and into the lower stratosphere. Within five days the smoke would cover the war region,within nine days it would reach around the globe, and within 49 days it would cover the inhabited earth. Smoke from nuclear fires would stay aloft for 10 years and would block enough sunlight to maintain overcast conditions everywhere. Climate models forecast that this smoke would quickly cool the earth to below temperatures experienced for the past 1,000 years. According to the authors these changes would play havoc with agricultural production and big drops in crop yields would occur everywhere. Panic would cripple the global agricultural system. About one billion peopleworldwide live on marginal food supplies and they could die from famine. The nuclear winter envisaged in the 1980s in the aftermath ofnuclear war would destroy civilisation and possibly eliminate the human race. A nuclear winter after a regional war would be less calamitous in scale. But it would set civilisation back 100 years and this is to assume that social order is maintained and that all we would have to recover from is environmental degradation. But, of course, social order could break down leading to chaos, with God knows what results. The authors put it plainly when they say: The only way to eliminate the possibility of climatic catastrophe is to elimi<br />

These conflicts draw in great powers and go nuclear<br />
Weiner, Prof. Princeton, ‘90 The Next 100 Years p.270<br />
If we do not destroy ourselves with the A-bomb and the H-bomb, then we may destroy ourselves with the C-bomb, the Change Bomb. And in a world as interlinked as ours, one explosion may lead to the other. Already in the Middle East, tram North Africa to the Persian Gulf and from the Nile to the Euphrates, tensions over dwindling water supplies and rising populations are reaching what many experts describe as a flashpoint A climate shift in that single battle-scarred nexus might trigger international tensions that will unleash some at the 60.000 nuclear warheads the world has stockpiled since Trinity.<br />

<em>China is aiming to reshape the global aviation industry with a home-grown jetliner, a direct challenge to the supremacy of Boeing and Airbus, the world's only manufacturers of large commercial aircraft. The communist government has staked billions of dollars and national pride on the effort. What may surprise some Americans worried about slipping U.S. competitiveness is that some well-known U.S. companies are aiding China in its quest. That partnership will be on display next week at an air show in southern China with the unveiling of a full-scale mockup of the C919. Slated for production by 2016, the 156-seat, single-aisle passenger plane would have its fuselage emblazoned with Comac, short for the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China. But inside, the most crucial systems would bear the trademarks of some of the biggest names in Western aviation. Honeywell International Inc. will supply power units, on-board computing systems, wheels and brakes; Rockwell Collins Inc. will handle navigation systems; GE Aviation is building the avionics; Eaton Corp. is involved with fuel and hydraulics; and Parker Aerospace of Irvine is responsible for flight controls. Powering the aircraft will be two fuel-efficient engines built by CFM International, a company co-owned by GE and French conglomerate Safran. Global supply chains are common in the aviation industry: Chicago-based Boeing and Europe's Airbus rely on parts makers and assembly operations around the world. But China isn't content just to buy sophisticated gear for the C919; the government has required foreign suppliers to set up joint ventures with Chinese companies. That has put U.S. and European suppliers in a tough spot: Be willing to hand over advanced technology to Chinese firms that could one day be rivals or miss out on what's likely to be the biggest aviation bonanza of the next half a century. Honeywell alone has snagged contracts worth more than $11 billion for the project. &quot;You're faced with either being part of it or not,&quot; said Billy Lay, a Dubai-based partner at PRTM, an international consulting firm with expertise in aerospace. &quot;I don't know what the alternatives are.&quot; Actually, we've dealt with such scenarios before, when Americans were concerned with growing Japanese industrial competitiveness in the late-1980s (see, &quot;Beyond Mutual Recrimination: Building a Solid U.S.-Japan Relationship in the. 1990s,&quot; and &quot;Do Relative Gains Matter? America's Response to Japanese Industrial Policy&quot;). Back then, the U.S. response was to place export controls on sensitive industrial sectors, especially in aerospace. I can't imagine in just twenty years that kind of realpolitik in economic policy (neo-mercantilism) has been completely repudiated at the top levels of strategic planning. Perhaps Japan was more brazenly competitive, or China's more stealthy now. Either way, concerns for relative gains contributed to restrictions on sensitive technologies, and limits on private sector exports and cooperation in strategic technologies. Maybe we're complacent. But we're still on top, at least for now. See, &quot;Asia and Europe Giving U.S. Science a Run for the Money&quot;: The United States still leads the world with its scientific clout, armed with highly respected universities and a big war chest of funding, but Europe and Asia are catching up, according to a Thomson Reuters report released on Friday. The U.S. emphasis on biological and medical sciences leaves the fields of physical sciences and engineering open to the competition, the report finds. &quot;The United States is no longer the Colossus of Science, dominating the research landscape in its production of scientific papers, that it was 30 years ago,&quot; the report reads. &quot;It now shares this realm, on an increasingly equal basis, with the EU27 (the 27 European Union members) and Asia-Pacific,&quot; adds the report, available at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:8230:http://researchanalytics.thomsonreuters.com/grr/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://researchanalytics.thomsonreuters.com/grr/" rel="nofollow">http://researchanalytics.thomsonreuters.com/grr/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:8230 -->. I'll be back to this topic soon. President Obama was just in the news last week with the statement that America's best days were behind us: &quot;Obama Acknowledges Decline of U.S. Dominance.&quot; The president is post-American anyway, but the matter's worth paying attention to. As noted, I'm mostly with Joseph Nye above. But extreme levels of deficit and debt, and now with new signs of threatening international economic competition, look to be putting tremendous pressure on the continuation of American world leadership.</em><br />

<em>Mass investment into groundbreaking space development reverses this trend – only federal government certainty ensures private sector investment and long-term sustainability of the aerospace sector</em><br />

Unfortunately, the US investment in advanced research and technology for space exploration and development has been reduced to historically low levels, and concurrently has been focused more narrowly than ever before on immediate system designs and development projects. In many respects, the current budget is little more than an “advanced development” program with minimal opportunity for innovation and essentially no possibility that an invention arising from civil space research and technology programs could influence system design decisions, inform budget estimates or inspire new, more ambitious space program goals. The challenge today Space has never been more important to our national security than it is today. The opportunities for truly profound scientific discoveries through space exploration have never been greater. And the pace of international development of new capabilities for space operations has never been faster. Federal budgets for advanced research and technology to enable future space exploration and development have been reduced in scope and focused on near-term system developments to the point that US preeminence in space activities is in question. NASA’s advanced space research and technology budget was over $2 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2005, with a focus on objectives five to ten years in the future and with the purpose of informing program and design decisions, while retiring both technical and budget risks of those future programs. The President’s FY 2007 budget for NASA exploration technology declined to less than $700 million, and of that only a small fraction (perhaps less than $200 million) still addressed longer-term objectives. The corresponding budgets in 2008 and 2009 were further reduced. Little to none of the remaining investment deals with enabling fundamentally new goals or objectives, or dramatically reducing expected costs. With these funding levels and program goals, it is unlikely that the US will maintain leadership in space exploration beyond the current generation of projects—all of which are founded on the “seed corn” harvested from past investments in innovative new space capabilities. Further, declining support for space research and technology is creating an innovation vacuum in the US as small business opportunities evaporate, and funding for universities and students vanishes. This trend jeopardizes America’s long-term leadership in space exploration and development, and damages our ability to achieve important national security goals. History Since the conclusion of the Apollo program in the early 1970s, the US space program has experienced varying levels of support from national leaders in the White House and the US Congress. Moreover, during most of that time human exploration beyond low Earth orbit has been “off the agenda”, with the exception of the short-lived Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) of 1989–1993. During the same period, US robotic exploration has had a number of tremendous successes, primarily involving the outer planets (e.g., Voyager spacecraft, Galileo, and more recently, Cassini), but also the inner solar system (e.g., Viking on Mars, Magellan at Venus), and the recent series of Mars missions (e.g., Pathfinder/Sojourner, Mars Observer, Spirit and Opportunity). However, these programs have tended to reflect one-of-a-kind successes with a minimal number of spacecraft and missions using common systems or technologies, resulting in continuing very high costs. Various attempts to create a foundation of common technologies and modular spacecraft have failed. Similarly, attempts to bridge the gap between robotic mission systems technologies and human space flight technologies (e.g., “Platform Z” from the early Space Station Freedom program) have failed. The most notable successes in this vein arose from the in-space assembly and spacecraft servicing capabilities of the Space Shuttle, first in the early 1980s with the Solar Max servicing mission, then with the series of hugely successful Hubble Space Telescope servicing missions, and finally with the assembly of the International Space Station. However, these achievements were far more the exception than the rule. For the most part human and robotic exploration systems and technologies became increasingly isolated beginning in the 1970s. More recently Following the Columbia tragedy in 2003, the direction of the US space program was again the subject of intense discussion (led by the White House) and including various agencies and organizations. The result, announced in January 2004, was the “Vision for Space Exploration” (VSE). The VSE as formulated originally was much more than a new justification for human space flight. Rather, the Vision addressed the full range of human and robotic exploration, as well as a revitalization of advanced space research and technology with far-reaching implications. The original VSE strategy placed strong emphasis on studies, research, and technology developments that would in time inform decisions regarding architectures and systems for (1) a Space Shuttle replacement; (2) annual robotic technology missions to the Moon; (3) a human return to the Moon to establish a permanent presence; (4) new space observatories to explore the universe beyond our solar system; (5) a campaign of robotic missions to Mars and beyond; and more. With current funding levels and program goals, it is unlikely that the US will maintain leadership in space exploration beyond the current generation of projects—all of which are founded on the “seed corn” harvested from past investments in innovative new space capabilities. However, in 2005 NASA shifted to a dramatically different approach to exploration and related technology developments with the results of the Exploration Systems Architecture Study. ESAS results placed exclusive emphasis on a US human lunar return and in an attempt to accelerate the first operational capability for the “crew exploration vehicle”—a capsule-based Space Shuttle replacement. To achieve this focus, numerous strategic changes were necessary. References to other aspects of space science and exploration were dropped, as was integrated planning of human and robotic exploration missions. For example, the initially planned annual campaign of robotic technology missions to the Moon was reduced to a single orbiter and one lunar lander mission, and these retained little or no role in guiding design decisions for human lunar systems. Also, to avoid technology-related risks, a range of lifecycle cost-related architectural options were eliminated from consideration, including in-space assembly of lunar transportation systems, in-space fueling and servicing, reusable lunar transportation systems, and others. The result was a family of systems for low Earth orbit access and a return to the Moon that involved a re-sized, Apollo-like architectural approach, with a heavy-lift launch vehicle and expendable transportation system elements. Significant shifts in agency budgets followed these new strategic directions, including drastic reductions in advanced space research and technology development, and a redefinition of remaining investments as “technology development”, focused on already-made design decisions. This shift in strategy was epitomized by NASA’s elimination of the NASA Institute of Advanced Concepts (NIAC) on the grounds of budget constraints, despite that fact that NIAC represented less than one third of one percent of the agency’s annual budget. The real point was that NIAC no longer had a legitimate role given NASA’s new approach to innovation: low engineering risk designs, and modest technology developments focused on those designs. Unfortunately, the elimination of design-to-cost and investments in longer-term innovation have come with a price. By recent estimates, the transportation-related cost of a single human mission to the Moon using the present, low-technology design solution will exceed $5 billion; transportation for two crewed lunar missions per year would require approximately 60% of NASA’s annual budget. Moreover, in-house agency subject matter expertise has been severely affected, as has the Agency’s contribution to US space technology leadership. Overall, the ambitious goals that were articulated by the White House in 2004 have been pushed into the indefinite future. A permanent human outpost of the Moon, development of lunar resources, deployment of large space observatories, and ambitious missions to the outer planets: all of these have been pushed out into the future by 20 years or more. Moreover, it is difficult to envision how such goals could ever be achieved using current systems concepts and concomitant prohibitively high costs. Only new systems concepts, enabled by focused space research and technology developments, can change this assessment. At the same time, real progress continues to be made by the international space community, grounded in steady investments in new technologies and systems—and resulting in regular accomplishments in space systems. The international flotilla of robotic space missions to the Moon illustrates this point: the US contribution of a single orbiter and a future lander are largely indistinguishable from the missions of other countries. Without an adequate strategy for, and more robust investment in, advanced space research and technology, long-term US preeminence in space exploration and development is doubtful. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) of the US Department of Defense (DOD) provides a useful example for how long-term but focused government research and technology advancement may be pursued. In particular, the ONR uses four complementary program strategies: a foundation of in-house subject matter expertise, sustained basic research and technology investments, development and demonstration of prototypes, and a focus on future capabilities. The concept of “Future Naval Capabilities” (FNCs) is used by the ONR to focus advanced research and technology (R&amp;T) efforts around novel systems and concepts of operations. FNCs allow a range of R&amp;T investments to be coordinated around specific new capabilities—even though the details of those systems designs have not yet been finalized, nor development programs approved. Also, the ONR uses the concept of “Innovative Naval Prototypes” (INPs) to orchestrate a range of ongoing R&amp;T and draw the results of those efforts into nearer-term demonstrations of working prototypes and test-beds. INPs are characterized by ambitious technical objectives, and their potential to truly transform future naval operations. In addition, the ONR has preserved for over 60 years a commitment to long lead, discipline-oriented research and technology development. These investments have been responsible for advances in areas as diverse as materials, electronics, communications, power, and others—but all leading toward naval preeminence. And finally, DOD investments have maintained a foundation of in-house subject matter expertise at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and other installations. Over the years, these in-house experts have enabled more effective technology investment decisions and, working with civilian and uniformed leaders better system acquisition decisions. Novel technologies and systems concepts must be matured and validated before decisions are made regarding the detailed designs of future space systems. There are a variety of business models that might be considered for space research and technology development. However, the strategies used by the ONR for its investments seem especially appropriate to the long-term character of the challenge of space exploration and development. For civil space exploration and development, these would be: (1) maintenance of in-house NASA subject matter expertise in relevant technologies; (2) sustained, discipline-oriented investment in basic research and technology at NASA centers, universities, and small businesses; (3) development and demonstration of transformational systems prototypes in partnerships involving NASA, major industry and others; and (4) a sustained focus on future space capabilities. And the results of these investments must be harvested before designs are finalized and system acquisition programs started. Assessment It is hardly consistent with the aspirations of Americans to “go where everyone has been before…” However, it is fantasy to suppose that the civil space program can affordably accomplish ambitious goals and objectives in space using systems concepts and technologies of the last century. Novel technologies and systems concepts must be matured and validated before decisions are made regarding the detailed designs of future space systems. In fact, numerous reports over a period of decades have established the criticality of a robust and focused investment in advanced research and technology, including the findings of several National Commissions, committees of the National Academy of Sciences, and others. Stable, robust, long-term federal investments in advanced research and technology for future civil space capabilities—funded at a level sufficient to assure US preeminence in space science, exploration, and utilization—are critical if we are to meet the challenges of this century: achieving ambitious goals in science and exploration, delivering on the promise of space to contribute to a strong national economy, maintaining a skilled aerospace workforce, and providing the foundations for future national security. It is time for the Congress and the White House—recognizing the challenges facing this nation’s space sector—to articulate and implement a strategy to revitalize advanced space research and technology and to make a sustained commitment to the implementation of that strategy. The recently chartered national study on the future of human space exploration, chaired by Norm Augustine, should take up this task. What should be done? The following actions are needed now: The federal government should revitalize its investment to invent and develop innovative new technologies for space science, exploration, and development, consistent with assuring US preeminence in space activities and industry’s ability to adopt these innovations for application in future space missions and markets. A balanced distribution should be created in the allocation of revitalized advanced space research and technology funding among more basic research efforts, technology maturation, and demonstrations of new technologies. These investments should be guided by the goal of creating ambitious new “future space capabilities”—well-enough defined to inform technology investments, but flexible enough to allow the results of those investments to influence designs, reduce costs, and enable new and more ambitious science goals. In establishing these investments, NASA must seek and embrace inputs from outside the agency (including other agencies, industry, academia) to develop, review, and recommend NASA advanced space research and technology plans, programs, and strategies. NASA in-house space research and technology (performed by engineers and technical specialists) should be restored, in balance with increased external research (by industry and academia). Funding for university research should also be targeted toward producing graduates with advanced degrees to support the follow-on work that will be undertaken by industry. We need to reconsider what makes an ambitious space program worth a substantial investment of public dollars—and consider again the historical and future importance of advancing space technology and developing truly new and valuable space capabilities for the public, the nation, and the world. To achieve the purposes for which it was created, NASA must maintain the excellence of its workforce and their expertise in a wide array of cutting-edge new technologies. As they enter the workforce, it will be impossible to attract the “best and the brightest” to federal service without a foundation of cutting-edge research and technology program opportunities. Moreover, a healthy NASA workforce, armed with appropriate skills and secure in its future, will provide better oversight for technical system procurement and program management. This competence will result in better performing systems, better ability to meet schedule, more productive interactions with other stakeholders in the aerospace enterprise, and more efficient use of taxpayer dollars. Although NASA must accommodate changing priorities and budgets, it must also ensure that it does not lose the important skills and knowledge currently possessed by its workers. NASA also must continue to ensure that the NASA workforce gains the new competencies needed in the aerospace industry of the future. In order accelerate the transition of novel technologies into transformational future space capabilities NASA must invest in demonstrations of innovative space prototypes on the ground and in space. Innovative space prototypes should be implemented in coordination with the DoD, academia, and industry; and wherever possible with co-funding with the private sector in order to speed the application of these new capabilities in creating new space industries. To implement these recommendations effectively, focused and timely near term action is essential: The National Academy of Sciences (National Research Council) should be chartered to conduct an independent, visionary study to identify 6–12 transformational “future space capabilities” that would—if developed—enable a wide range of new, ambitious, and affordable space exploration and development. These future space capabilities would in turn drive planning for government and industry research and technology investments. The Administration should develop—in consultation with the US Congress, and using NASA as its executive agent—a strategic research and technology development roadmap that establishes a baseline for achieving these goals, including objectives, schedules, milestones and budgets. This roadmap should be used to provide the basis for future US investments in advanced space research and technology development and demonstrations. The US space program needs more than a national discussion of what human exploration should do next: International Space Station research versus lunar outposts versus asteroid sorties versus human Mars missions, and so on. These are important questions. Even more, however, we need to set in place basic policies that can endure from one administration to the next. We need to reconsider what makes an ambitious space program worth a substantial investment of public dollars—and consider again the historical and future importance of advancing space technology and developing truly new and valuable space capabilities for the public, the nation, and the world.<br />

A dominant aerospace industry is vital to economic growth—its key to innovation and jobs<br />

Aerospace is an especially important industry for a nation's economic and physical security, and perhaps no other country has benefited more from the aerospace industry than the United States.9 The Final Report of the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry states that the industry &quot;contributes over 15 percent to our Gross Domestic Product and supports over 15 million high quality American jobs&quot; (Aerospace Industry Commission 2002, 1-2). U.S. aerospace has been identified as a major source of &quot;technical innovation with substantial spillovers to other industrial and commercial sectors&quot; and &quot;high-wage employment, which spreads the benefits of rising productivity throughout the U.S. economy.…&quot; The Aerospace Commission also noted the industry's contribution to the nation's &quot;economic growth, quality of life, and scientific achievements….&quot; (Aerospace Industry Commission 2002, 1-2). Despite the importance of aerospace, the deterioration of the industry at home has continued at a dramatic rate. Nearly 500,000 jobs have been lost in the U.S. aerospace industry since 1990 (Aerospace Industry Commission 2002, 8-12; see also AIA 2007), and several hundred thousand more workers have lost their jobs in related industries. Sadly, the fact of these enormous job losses comes as no surprise. More than 10 years ago, in Jobs on the Wing, authors Randy Barber and Robert Scott predicted that &quot;up to 469,000&quot; jobs in the aerospace and related industries &quot;could be eliminated by 2013 because of offset policies and increased foreign competition&quot; (Barber and Scott 1995, 2). In a later study, Scott predicted that by 2013 the industry would suffer a loss of over 25% &quot;of the total jobs in aircraft production in 1995&quot; (Scott 1998). These gloomy predictions are apparently reinforced by U.S. government reports. According to the Department of Labor, the outlook for employment in the U.S. aerospace industry is not rosy: between 2002 and 2012 aerospace employment in the United States will &quot;decrease by 18 percent&quot; (U.S. Department of Labor 2004). The future health of the industry depends in large part on its ability to attract new workers, but the crisis in employment and the prediction that the crisis will deepen does not bode well for attracting new workers. In its final report, the Aerospace Commission summarized this concern: The U.S. aerospace sector, once the employer of choice for the &quot;best and brightest&quot; technically trained workers, now finds it presents a negative image to potential employees. Surveys indicate a feeling of disillusionment about the aerospace industry among its personnel, whether they are production/technical workers, scientists or engineers. The majority of newly dislocated workers say they will not return to aerospace. In a recent survey of nearly 500 U.S. aerospace engineers, managers, production workers, and technical specialists, 80 percent of respondents said they would not recommend aerospace careers to their children. (Aerospace Industries Commission 2002, 8-5) While the Aerospace Commission found that &quot;U.S. policy toward domestic aerospace employment must reaffirm the goal of stabilizing and increasing the number of good and decent jobs in the industry,&quot; this policy has yet to be embraced, let alone implemented (Aerospace Industries Commission 2002, 8-12). Far from embracing any sort of effective industrial policy when it comes to aerospace, the U.S. government continues to relegate policy development in this area to private parties, just as it does with offsets in general. The inherent weakness to this approach is obvious—private U.S. companies must compete with foreign companies that have the full support of their governments. If a sale means transferring production and/or technology, private companies are in a difficult position. Given that their interests do not always align with the national interest, they can be expected to maximize corporate returns, even though the use of offsets, which can deeply affect an industry as essential to the nation's economy and security as aerospace, can be detrimental to U.S. national interests. Should there be any doubt about the seriousness of the competition from foreign entities and governments, one has only to look at the success of companies like EADS. What were once fledgling industries are now U.S. competitors who benefit from a sophisticated approach to offsets that moves jobs and technology their way.10 As succinctly stated by the Aerospace Commission, &quot;…foreign nations clearly recognize the potential benefits from aerospace and are attempting to wrest global leadership away from us&quot; (Aerospace Industries Commission 2002, 1-2). A country that truly understands the importance of adopting a comprehensive aerospace policy based on offsets is China. As reported in the 2005 Report to Congress of the of U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, &quot;…Chinese firms have used their leverage to extract offsets—agreements to transfer some of the aircraft production along with related expertise and technology—as part of the deals&quot;; the report further concludes, &quot;China nurtures its domestic aviation and aerospace industry by exploiting the international competition already in the industry&quot; (U.S.-China Review Commission 2005, 30). Indeed, as summarized in one U.S. government report: China is likely to be the largest customer—and possibly an emerging competitor—of the U.S. aerospace industry in the future. China's aerospace manufacturing base is enormous. U.S. companies (and European companies to a lesser extent) have successfully partnered with Chinese companies that provide components or parts for a number of commercial aerospace programs. However, China also is seeking to become a world-class prime commercial aerospace manufacturing industrial base, both through indigenous development programs and joint ventures with non-Chinese companies. (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, xii) In testimony in 2001, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) singled out China for developing an effective industrial policy in an effort to create its own aerospace industry. It noted in its testimony that the U.S. International Trade Commission had already found with respect to China, &quot;…the nation's aviation sector intends to pursue a principal role in commercial aircraft manufacturing.&quot;11 During a 1998 visit to China to tour aerospace facilities, IAM participants observed the country's enormous aerospace capacity.12 China's aviation industry &quot;consists of more than 200 enterprises that produce and manufacture products such as aircraft, turboprop engines, aircraft components and subsystems, helicopters, industrial gas turbines, and various electromechanical products&quot; (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, 58). China's huge industrial capacity has been noted by other observers as well.13 For example, one research group notes that in China there are six companies devoted to &quot;airframe assembly,&quot; eight &quot;engine&quot; companies, 28 entities involved with &quot;components,&quot; and 20 &quot;research institutes.&quot;14 The two leading aircraft companies in China (China Aviation Industry Corporation I [AVIC I] and Aviation Industry Corporation II [AVIC II]) &quot;and their subsidiaries have about 491,000 employees&quot; (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, 5815). How did China develop such a huge capacity for aerospace production? While there are many different and related methods China uses, a significant one is offsets.16 As globalization critic Jeff Faux said in testimony to Congress, &quot;China is one of the most aggressive countries in pursuing offsets agreements and, with its market potential and minimal labor standards, it has substantial leverage in negotiating these agreements&quot; (Faux 2002). And as a business person told the Wall Street Journal, &quot;they're interested in having total access to technology….&quot;17 Of particular concern to the United States is the huge involvement of Boeing in China, an involvement the company acknowledges. According to its Web site: &quot;Boeing procurement from China is significantly greater than other aviation companies&quot; (Boeing 2007). According to company summaries: Since the 1980s, Boeing has purchased more than $1 billion in aviation hardware and services from China. Approximately 4,500 Boeing airplanes with parts and assemblies built by China are flying throughout the world today. Boeing and Boeing supplier partners have active supplier contracts with China's aviation industry valued at well over $2.5 billion (Boeing 2007). A detailed listing illustrating Boeing's extensive procurement activities, production work, and supplier involvement in China appears in the appendix. According to a news report, &quot;Boeing is expanding its relationship with China through plans to double its annual purchases from Chinese companies over the next six years to more than $1 billion per year by 2010&quot; (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, 59, citing Business Daily Update, &quot;Boeing Seeks Higher-Level Cooperation With Chinese Suppliers&quot;). Boeing is, of course, just one of many aerospace companies investing in China's aerospace industry; another is Boeing's chief rival, Airbus. As quoted in The Australian (&quot;Airbus Enlists China,&quot; June 14, 2004), Airbus Chief Executive Noel Forgeard explained his company's philosophy with respect to China: &quot;Airbus is not only selling aircraft in China but is also committed to the long-term development of China's aviation industry.&quot; The Australian also reported that parts of the A380 will be produced in China: European aircraft maker Airbus has subcontracted a state-owned Chinese manufacturer to make parts for its super-jumbo A380 plane, in a deal worth about $170 million. China Aviation Corp. I (AVIC I) will make panels for A380 nose-landing gear….China's Shenyang Aircraft Corp., affiliated with AVIC I, would also be subcontracted to make A330/A340 forward-cargo door projects….Five Chinese companies are now making parts for Airbus. The New York Times reported that Airbus is committed &quot;to buy at least $60 million yearly in parts from China by 2007, rising to $120 million yearly by 2010.&quot;18 According to other news reports, China will &quot;build wing boxes for Airbus&quot; in a $500 million deal,19 and Airbus and China have agreed on &quot;a $9 billion order…for 150 narrow-body A320 aircraft, and said they would study the possibility of building a final assembly line for the aircraft in China.&quot;20 That study apparently produced positive results; as stated in an Airbus press release (&quot;Joint Venture Contract Signed for the A320 Family Final Assembly Line in Tianjin,&quot; June 28, 2007): &quot;The FAL [final assembly line] in Tianjin will be based on the latest state-of-the-art Airbus single-aisle final assembly line in Hamburg, Germany. The aircraft will be assembled and delivered in China to the same standards as those assembled and delivered in Europe.&quot; The significance of such a development cannot be overstated: &quot;the memorandum of understanding between China's National Development and Reform Commission and Airbus…meant that China was likely to become only the third country assembling Airbus aircraft, after France and Germany.&quot;21 Brazil's aerospace industry is also teaming up with China. &quot;In order to supply its domestic market while continuing to learn how to assemble a modern, complete aircraft to Western standards, two AVIC-II companies teamed with Embraer…in 2002 for co-production of their regional jet (ERJ-145) in Harbin&quot; (Andersen 2008). Eurocopter, a subsidy of EADS, is also involved with China's aerospace industry. &quot;France's Eurocopter and Singapore Technologies Aerospace have signed with Hafei Aviation, a listed arm of one of China's top military contractors, to make helicopters for domestic civil use.&quot;22 China's aerospace industry is apparently not content to maintain its current level of success. According to news reports, &quot;China is likely to start developing its own large aircraft rather than rely solely on foreign giants Boeing and Airbus….&quot;23 The country recently announced that it would be entering the large civil aircraft industry in the next 20 years,24 and, according to news reports, much of the success of this effort depends on the transfer of production and technology from other countries, presumably in the form of outsourcing and offsets from U.S. and other aerospace companies. And according to a report in Jane's Defence Weekly, &quot;China is developing a new stealthy fighter jet aircraft and many of the design concepts and components have already been created….This new aircraft is the first Eastern rival to the West's F/A-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to be put into development….&quot;25 China's aerospace industry may even be expanding to space. In an article headlined &quot;The Next Space Race: China Heads to the Stars,&quot; the New York Times (January 22, 2004) raises the possibility of a space race with China, noting: The Chinese plan to send more astronauts into space next year, to launch a Moon probe within three years, and are aiming to land an unmanned vehicle on the Moon by 2010…. Will the U.S. aerospace industry remain the strongest in the world? As other countries implement industrial policies based on outsourcing and offsets, the question becomes more urgent. Moves by countries like China to implement industrial policies targeting U.S. leadership in such essential industries as aerospace call for a response by U.S. policy makers. Even if China's aerospace industry remains behind that of the United States, it is poised to contribute to growing global competition. It has the capacity, skilled workforce, and the will to make this a reality. The virtually unregulated world of offsets only exacerbates this situation. While the U.S. government continues a hands-off approach to this market-distorting scheme, other countries are giving their companies significant backing based on well-developed industrial policies.<br />

<em>SBSP is unusual among renewable energy options because it might satisfy all four of the following criteria critical to investment decisions: environmental cleanliness, sustainability of supply, flexibility of location, and capacity to generate continuous rather than intermittent power. The cost of SBSP-generated electricity would initially be greater than that provided by fossil fuel or nuclear power but could be comparable to other alternative energy sources, particularly for baseload power. In addition, SBSP might offer an attractive approach, not only for satisfying today's needs but also for meeting tomorrow’s much greater requirements. We cannot accurately predict environmental and other consequences of harvesting energy from natural Earthbound sources (e.g., wind, ocean current, geothermal, biofuels), when these methods are scaled up to considerably higher levels. By providing an additional source of renewable energy, SBSP might help avoid potentially negative consequences if limits to the costeffective expansion of other renewable sources become evident. Beyond enhancement of energy production per se, SBSP might help create new economic opportunities through resultant technology advances in space launch, space utilization, and technological spin-offs applicable to a host of materials and processes. For example, SBSP research might lead to improvements in the efficiency of solar cells that power communications satellites, as well as power management systems for terrestrial solar power systems. Also, to the extent that SBSP is integrated into terrestrial solar power production, development of SBSP ground infrastructure might generate revenue even before deployment of systems in space. In this and related applications, SBSP could emerge as an enhancement for, rather than a competitor with, terrestrial solar power generation.</em><br />

<em>Economic decline causes global war</em><br />
<em>Royal 10 [Jedediah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction – U.S. Department of Defense, “Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises”, Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, Ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215</em> STRONG]<br />
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next. As such, exogenous shocks such as economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power (see also Gilpin. 1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, increasing the risk of miscalculation (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland's (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that 'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states. He argues that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, if the expectations of future trade decline, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Blomberg and Hess (2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write: The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other. (Blomberg &amp; Hess, 2002. p. 89) Economic decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism (Blomberg, Hess, &amp; Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. &quot;Diversionary theory&quot; suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect. Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force. In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels.5 This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.<br />

Aerospace key to heg- only way to maintain tech dominance<br />

<em>Defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the federal govern-ment.2 This translates into two broad missions—Defend America and Project Power—when and where needed. In order to defend America and project power, the nation needs the ability to move manpower, materiel, intelligence information and precision weaponry swiftly to any point around the globe, when needed. This has been, and will continue to be, a mainstay of our national security strategy. The events of September 11, 2001 dramatically demonstrated the extent of our national reliance on aerospace capabilities and related military contribu-tions to homeland security. Combat air patrols swept the skies; satellites supported real-time communica-tions for emergency responders, imagery for recov- ery, and intelligence on terrorist activities; and the security and protection of key government officials was enabled by timely air transport. As recent events in Afghanistan and Kosovo show, the power generated by our nation’s aerospace capa-bilities is an—and perhaps the—essential ingredient in force projection and expeditionary operations. In both places, at the outset of the crisis, satellites and reconnaissance aircraft, some unmanned, provided critical strategic and tactical intelligence to our national leadership. Space-borne intelligence, com-mand, control and communications assets permitted the rapid targeting of key enemy positions and facil-ities. Airlifters and tankers brought personnel, materiel, and aircraft to critical locations. And aerial bombardment, with precision weapons and cruise missiles, often aided by the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Predator unmanned vehicle, destroyed enemy forces. Aircraft carriers and their aircraft also played key roles in both conflicts. Today’s military aerospace capabilities are indeed robust, but at significant risk. They rely on platforms and an industrial base—measured in both human capital and physical facilities—that are aging and increasingly inadequate. Consider just a few of the issues: • Much of our capability to defend America and project power depends on satellites. Assured reli-able access to space is a critical enabler of this capa-bility. As recently as 1998, the key to near- and mid-term space access was the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), a development project of Boeing, Lockheed Martin and the U. S. Air Force. EELV drew primarily on commercial demand to close the business case for two new launchers, with the U.S. government essentially buying launches at the margin. In this model, each company partner made significant investments of corporate funds in vehicle development and infrastructure, reducing the overall need for government investment. Today, however, worldwide demand for commer-cial satellite launch has dropped essentially to nothing—and is not expected to rise for a decade or more—while the number of available launch platforms worldwide has proliferated. Today, therefore, the business case for EELV simply does not close, and reliance on the economics of a com-mercially-driven market is unsustainable. A new strategy for assured access to space must be found. • The U.S. needs unrestricted access to space for civil, commercial, and military applications. Our satellite systems will become increasingly impor- tant to military operations as today’s information revolution, the so-called “revolution in military affairs,” continues, while at the same time satellites will become increasingly vulnerable to attack as the century proceeds. To preserve critical satellite net-works, the nation will almost certainly need the capability to launch replacement satellites quickly after an attack. One of the key enablers for “launch on demand” is reusable space launch, and yet within the last year all work has been stopped on the X-33 and X-34 reusable launch programs • The challenge for the defense industrial base is to have the capability to build the base force struc-ture, support contingency-related surges, provide production capacity that can increase faster than any new emerging global threat can build up its capacity, and provide an “appropriate” return to shareholders. But the motivation of government and industry are different. This is a prime detrac-tion for wanting to form government-industry partnerships. Industry prioritizes investments toward near-term, high-return, and high-dollar programs that make for a sound business case for them. Government, on the other hand, wants to prioritize investment to ensure a continuing capa-bility to meet any new threat to the nation. This need is cyclical and difficult for businesses to sus-tain during periods of government inactiv-ity. Based on the cyclic nature of demand, the increasing cost/complexity of new systems, and the slow pace of defense modernization, aerospace companies are losing market advantages and the sector is contracting. Twenty-two years ago, today’s “Big 5” in aerospace were 75 separate companies, as depicted by the historical chart of industry con-solidation shown in Chapter 7. • Tactical combat aircraft have been a key compo-nent of America’s air forces. Today, three tactical aircraft programs continue: the F/A-18E/F (in production), the F/A-22 (in a late stage of test and evaluation), and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (just moving into system design and development). Because of the recentness of these programs, there are robust design teams in existence. But all of the initial design work on all three programs will be completed by 2008. If the nation were to con- clude, as it very well may, that a new manned tac- tical aircraft needs to be fielded in the middle of this century, where will we find the experienced design teams required to design and build it, if the design process is in fact gapped for 20 years or more? • More than half of the aerospace workforce is over the age of 404, and the average age of aerospace defense workers is over 50.5Inside the Department of Defense (DoD), a large percent of all scientists and engineers will be retirement eligible by 2005. Given these demographics, there will be an exodus of “corporate knowledge” in the next decade that will be difficult and costly to rebuild once it is lost. There will be a critical need for new engineers, but little new work to mature their practical skill over the next several decades. Further, enrollment in aerospace engineering programs has dropped by 47 percent in the past nine years6, and the interest and national skills in mathematics and science are down. Defense spending on cutting-edge work is at best stable, and commercial aircraft programs are struggling and laying workers off. As the DoD’s recent Space Research and Development (R&amp;D) Industrial Base Study7 concluded, “[s]ustaining a talented workforce of sufficient size and experience remains a long-term issue and is likely to get worse.” In short, the nation needs a plan to attract, train and maintain a skilled, world-class aerospace workforce, but none currently exists. • The current U.S. research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) infrastructure has a legacy dating back to either World War II or the expan- sion during the Space Age in the 1960s. It is now suffering significantly from a lack of resources required for modernization. In some cases, our nation’s capabilities have atrophied and we have lost the lead, as with our outdated wind tunnels, where European facilities are now more modern and efficient. In the current climate, there is inad- equate funding to modernize aging government infrastructure or build facilities that would support the development of new transformational capabil- ities, such as wind tunnels needed to design and test new hypersonic vehicles. The aerospace indus-try must have access to appropriate, modern facil- ities to develop, test and evaluate new systems. Throughout this dynamic and challenging environ-ment, one message remains clear: a healthy U.S. aerospace industry is more than a hedge against an uncertain future. It is one of the primary national instruments through which DoD will develop and obtain the superior technologies and capabilities essential to the on-going transformation of the armed forces, thus maintaining our position as the world’s preeminent military power.</em><br />

<em>The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying -- its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe 's stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world 's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe -- if it adopted what some call a strategy of &quot;offshore balancing&quot; -- this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn 't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn 't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.</em><br />

Great power status is achieved through competition between nations. This competition is often based on advancing science and technology and applying these advancements to enabling new operational capabilities. A great power that succeeds in this competition adds to its power while a great power that does not compete or does so ineffectively or by choice, becomes comparatively less powerful. Eventually, it loses the great power status and then must align itself with another great power for protection. As the pace of science and technology advancement has increased, so has the potential for the pace of change of great power status. While the U.S. &quot;invented&quot; powered flight in 1903, a decade later leadership in this area had shifted to Europe. Within a little more than a decade after the Wright Brothers' first flights, the great powers of Europe were introducing aeronautics into major land warfare through the creation of air forces. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917, it was forced to rely on French-built aircraft. Twenty years later, as the European great powers were on the verge of beginning another major European war, the U.S. found itself in a similar situation where its choice to diminish national investment in aeronautics during the 1920's and 1930's—you may recall that this was the era of General Billy Mitchell and his famous efforts to promote military air power—placed U.S. air forces at a significant disadvantage compared to those of Germany and Japan. This was crucial because military air power was quickly emerging as the &quot;game changer&quot; for conventional warfare. Land and sea forces increasingly needed capable air forces to survive and generally needed air superiority to prevail. With the great power advantages of becoming spacefaring expected to be comparable to those derived from becoming air-faring in the 1920's and 1930's, a delay by the U.S. in enhancing its great power strengths through expanded national space power may result in a reoccurrence of the rapid emergence of new or the rapid growth of current great powers to the point that they are capable of effectively challenging the U.S. Many great powers—China, India, and Russia—are already speaking of plans for developing spacefaring capabilities. Yet, today, the U.S. retains a commanding aerospace technological lead over these nations. A strong effort by the U.S. to become a true spacefaring nation, starting in 2009 with the new presidential administration, may yield a generation or longer lead in space, not just through prudent increases in military strength but also through the other areas of great power competition discussed above. This is an advantage that the next presidential administration should exercise.<br />

<em>If we do not seize this historic opportunity to reduce our dependence on oil, we will bear the following serious consequences: 1. More conflicts in the Middle East America imports almost 60% of its oil today and, at this rate, we’ll import 70% by 2025. Where will that oil come from? Two-thirds of the world’s oil is in the Middle East, primarily in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. The United States has less than 3% of global oil. The Department of Energy predicts that North American oil imports from the Persian Gulf will double from 2001 to 2025. i Other oil suppliers, such as Venezuela, Russia, and West Africa, are also politically unstable and hold no significant long-term oil reserves compared to those in the Middle East. Bottom line: our economy and security are increasingly dependent on one of the most unstable regions on earth. Unless we change our ways, we will find ourselves even more at the mercy of Middle East oil and thus more likely to get involved in future conflicts. The greater our dependence on oil, the greater the pressure to protect and control that oil. The growing American dependence on imported oil is the primary driver of U.S. foreign and military policy today, particularly in the Middle East, and motivates an aggressive military policy now on display in Iraq. To help avoid similar wars in the future and to encourage a more cooperative, responsible, and multilateral foreign policy the United States must significantly reduce its oil use. Before the Iraq war started, Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said: “Regardless of whether we say so publicly, we will go to war, because Saddam sits at the center of a region with more than 60 percent of all the world's oil reserves.” Unfortunately, he was right. In fact, the use of military power to protect the flow of oil has been a central tenet of U.S. foreign policy since 1945. That was the year that President Franklin D. Roosevelt promised King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia that the United States would protect the kingdom in return for special access to Saudi oil—a promise that governs U.S. foreign policy today. This policy was formalized by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 when he announced that the secure flow of oil from the Persian Gulf was in “the vital interests of the United States of America” and that America would use “any means necessary, including military force” to protect those interests from outside forces. This doctrine was expanded by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 to cover internal threats, and was used by the first President Bush to justify the Gulf War of 1990-91, and provided a key, if unspoken rationale for the second President Bush’s invasion of Iraq in 2003. ii The Carter/Reagan Doctrine also led to the build up of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf on a permanent basis and to the establishment of the Rapid Deployment Force and the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The United States now spends over $50 Billion per year (in peacetime) to maintain our readiness to intervene in the Gulf. iii America has tried to address its oil vulnerability by using our military to protect supply routes and to prop up or install friendly regimes. But as Iraq shows the price is astronomical—$200 Billion and counting. Moreover, it doesn’t work—Iraq is now producing less oil than it did before the invasion. While the reasons behind the Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq may be complex, can anyone doubt that we would not be there today if Iraq exported coffee instead of oil? It is time for a new approach. Americans are no longer willing to support U.S. misadventures in the Persian Gulf. Recent polls show that almost two-thirds of Americans think the Iraq war was not worth the price in terms of blood and treasure. Lt. Gen William Odom, director of the National Security Agency during President Reagan's second term, recently said: &quot;The invasion of Iraq will turn out to be the greatest strategic disaster in U.S. history.&quot; The nation is understandably split about what to do now in Iraq, but there appears to be widespread agreement that America should not make the same mistake again—and we can take a giant step toward that goal by reducing our dependence on oil. More terrorist attacks on Americans The more dependent we are on foreign oil, the more troops we will deploy abroad to protect that oil. This creates resentment and invites terrorist attacks on our troops—and on oil supply routes. The U.S. troop presence in Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War was a major contributor to the rise of Islamic terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, and U.S. troops in Iraq are now a main justification for the insurgency there. We must break our oil habit so we can reduce our military footprint abroad. Moreover, much of the money we pay for our imported oil goes to countries or groups that support terrorism. It is no accident that 15 of the 19 September 11 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia, as does Osama Bin Laden. It is time we stop funneling money to our own enemies. According to a 2003 article in Foreign Affairs: “It is…increasingly clear that the riches from oil trickle down to those who would do harm to America and its friends. If this situation remains unchanged, the United States will find itself sending soldiers into battle again and again, adding the lives of American men and women in uniform to the already high cost of oil.” Iv 3. Collision course with China With over one billion people, China is second only to the U.S. in oil consumption—and gaining fast. China has one of the fastest growing economies in the world and an energy demand that is projected to grow by 150% by 2020. China’s oil demand is increasing seven times faster than America’s. v China currently imports half of its oil, and like the United States, China will become increasingly dependent on oil from the Middle East. As a result, access to Middle East oil will over time become a key issue in relations between the two nations. The more U.S. actions in the Middle East are perceived as an effort to dominate oil resources there, the more China will consider the United States a threat to its interests, and visa-versa. In the current context of stagnating supply, this kind of demand competition is very destabilizing. Defusing a potential U.S.-Chinese rivalry over global oil supplies is a key driver for reducing U.S. oil dependency. While China’s oil demand is growing rapidly, U.S. demand in absolute terms is much larger, accounting for a quarter of the world’s oil consumption. To its credit, China is taking steps to protect itself from the increasingly tight, volatile global oil market by controlling its oil demand. Last year China set fuel economy standards that are higher than those here in the United States. vi</em><br />

<em>This is troubling enough, but to conclude my panorama, the United States is not the only country that is militarizing its foreign oil policy. So are Russia and China. For Russia, it's not so much a need to acquire oil, because they have a lot of it, but because the Russians are attempting to reestablish their prominence as a major power. It's the explicit strategy of Vladimir Putin and his associates for Russia to be a dominant player in the oil flow from the Caspian Sea area to the West. They are expanding their Caspian Sea fleet. They are building new bases in the area. They maintain troops in Armenia, in Tajikistan, in Georgia, and also in Abkhazia. So in the Republic of Georgia you now have Russian troops and American troops within very close proximity. And the Russians are fighting a brutal war in Chechnya, which is ultimately driven on Russia's part by its absolute determination to control this critical strategic crossroads right in the heart of its oil pipeline empire in the Caspian Sea region. Grozny was the Houston of the former Soviet Union. It was the major concentration of refineries, and all of the pipelines from southern Russia met in Grozny. This was an absolutely pivotal center in their oil empire. They are absolutely determined to control this area, at least in part, because of this legacy and its strategic location. So Russia is a key player in this area. China is also becoming very interested in the Caspian Sea region and in the Persian Gulf as well. China's demand for oil is expected to quadruple during the first quarter of the 21st century. Their oil output, like that in the U.S. and in Europe, is in decline. They are becoming increasingly dependent on imported oil. Their leaders see Central Asia, the Caspian, and the Persian Gulf as the main source of China's future oil. China is copying the United States and Russia by militarizing its foreign oil policy, providing arms and military assistance, and even troops it's believed, to the government of Sudan in its war against the SPLA in the south. China is the leading investor in Sudan's major oil company in the southern part of the country. China provides arms and technology to Iran, one of its major suppliers. And through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, China is developing close military ties with Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, holding joint military maneuvers, providing them with weapons. So now you have a three-power military competition underway in the Central Asia Caspian region, all involving not so much necessarily direct presence, but building up military alliances with local governments, and in some cases insurgent forces, ethnic separatist groups; like the Russian presence in Abkhazia. If you look back in history for a similar moment, where you have so many powers competing for geopolitical influence in a volatile area, the example that comes to mind is the struggle in the Balkans before World War I, when the Austrian Empire and the Russian Empire and the British and the French were all competing for influence, providing military assistance to the local powers, getting involved in internal disputes, and we know what happened in Sarajevo in 1914. I see no evidence that any of these countries is backing off from their determination to dominate militarily the area where all of this oil is being sought. Because of the geographic shifts in the production of oil to areas of instability, growing competition for access to that oil, and the militarization of foreign oil policy, we are risking a very high level of violence emerging. Whether the net supply of the world rises for a while or declines, oil will be increasingly in competition. In a situation where these supplies are all the subject of military rivalries and intervention, this will lead to an ongoing series of oil wars for as long as we continue to depend on this substance</em><br />

<em>On 20 April 2010, a BP oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers and creating the largest oil spill in history. When President Obama sought to hold the corporation accountable by creating a $20B damage fund, this provoked Republican Congressman from Texas Joe Barton to issue a public apology. An apology not to the people affected by the oil spill … but to BP. In a peculiar inversion of ethics, Barton called the President’s measures a “shakedown”, finding it a “tragedy in the first proportion” that a corporation should be held accountable for the consequences of its actions. What does a Congressman’s inverted morality have to do with climate denial? Quite a bit. In a similar inversion of normal practice, most climate deniers avoid scrutiny by sidestepping the peer-review process that is fundamental to science, instead posting their material in the internet or writing books. Books may be impressively weighty, but remember that they are printed because a publisher thinks they can make money, not necessarily because the content has scientific value. Fiction sells, even if dressed up as science. During peer review, by contrast, commercial interests are removed from the publication decision because journals are often published by not-for-profit professional organizations. Even if private publishers are involved, they make their profit primarily via university subscriptions, and universities subscribe to journals based on their reputation, rather than based on individual publication decisions. Very occasionally a contrarian paper does appear in a peer-reviewed journal, which segments of the internet and the media immediately hail as evidence against global warming or its human causes, as if a single paper somehow nullifies thousands of previous scientific findings. What are we to make of that handful of contrarian papers? Do they make a legitimate if dissenting contribution to scientific knowledge? In some cases, perhaps. But in many other cases, troubling ethical questions arise from examination of the public record surrounding contrarian papers. For example, in 2003 the reputable journal Climate Research published a paleoclimatological analysis that concluded, in flat contradiction to virtually all existing research, that the 20th century was probably not the warmest of the last millennium. This paper, partially funded by the American Petroleum Institute, attracted considerable public and political attention because it seemingly offered relief from the need to address climate change. The paper also engendered some highly unusual fall-out. First, three editors of Climate Research resigned in protest over its publication, including the incoming editor-in-chief who charged that “…some editors were not as rigorous in the review process as is otherwise common.” This highly unusual mass resignation was followed by an even more unusual public statement from the publisher that acknowledged flaws in the journal’s editorial process. Three editorial resignations and a publisher’s acknowledgement of editorial flaws are not standard scientific practice and call for further examination of the authors and the accepting editor. The first author of this paper, Dr Willie Soon, is an astrophysicist by training. In U.S. congressional testimony, he identified his “training” in paleoclimatology as attendance at workshops, conferences, and summer schools. (The people who teach such summer schools, actual climate scientists, published a scathing rebuttal of Soon’s paper.) Undaunted, Dr Soon has since become an expert on polar bears, publishing a paper that accused the U.S. Geological Survey of being “unscientific” in its reports about the risks faced by polar bears from climate change. Most recently, Dr Soon has become an expert on mercury poisoning, using the Wall Street Journal as a platform to assuage fears about mercury-contaminated fish because, after all, “mercury has always existed naturally in Earth’s environment.” Lest one wonder what links paleoclimatology, Arctic ecology, and environmental epidemiology, the answer is not any conventional area of academic expertise but ideology. As Professor Naomi Oreskes and historian Erik Conway have shown in their insightful book, Merchants of Doubt, the hallmark of organized denial is that the same pseudo-experts emerge from the same shadowy “think” tanks over and over to rail against what they call “junk science”. Whether it is the link between smoking and lung cancer, between mercury and water poisoning, or between carbon emissions and climate change, ideology inverts facts and ethics whenever overwhelming scientific evidence suggests the need to regulate economic activity. So what of the editor who accepted the flawed Climate Research paper, Dr Chris de Freitas of Auckland? Later, De Freitas co-authored a paper in 2009 that some media outlets heralded as showing that climate change was down to nature. One of the authors, Adjunct academic Bob Carter from James Cook University, claimed that “our paper confirms what many scientists already know: which is that no scientific justification exists for emissions regulation.” Welcome news indeed, at least for the coal industry, but does the paper support this conclusion? No. For starters, the 2009 paper by McLean, de Freitas, and Carter did not address long-term global warming at all. It discussed the association between ocean currents and air temperature — in particular the time lag between the warm El Niño current and the ensuing increase in temperature. Indeed, the article does not even contain the words “climate change” except in a citation of the IPCC, and its only conceivable connection with climate change arises from the speculative phrase “ … and perhaps recent trends in global temperature …” in the final sentence. It appears ethically troubling to derive strong statements about emissions regulations from such a tentative clause in one’s final sentence in a paper on quite a different issue. Such statements appear even more troubling if one considers paragraph 14 of the paper, which reads, “to remove the noise, the absolute values were replaced with derivative values based on variations. Here the derivative is the 12-month running average subtracted from the same average for data 12 months later.” What happens to data if successive annual values are subtracted from each other? This mathematically removes any linear time trend. In other words, temperatures could have doubled every other year and it would have escaped detection by the authors. This removal of the trend did not escape detection by the scientific community, however, and the published rebuttal of this “it’s-all-natural” paper was as swift and devastating as it was for Dr Soon’s. To remove the linear trend from temperature data in a paper that does not address climate change, and to then claim that nature is responsible for global warming and there is no scientific basis for emissions regulations smacks of an inversion of scientific ethics and practice. Let us return to Congressman Barton. Before apologizing to BP, not for the nearly $3,000,000 he has received in contributions from the oil, gas, and energy industries, but for President Obama seeking accountability from the corporation, Mr Barton also sponsored a contrived investigation of the famed “hockeystick” paper by Professor Michael Mann and colleagues. The hockeystick is the iconic graph that shows the sky-rocketing temperatures of the last few decades in comparison to the relatively constant temperatures during the preceding centuries. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences affirmed the basic conclusions of Professor Mann, as have numerous other papers published during the last decade. Mr. Barton, however, relied on a report by a certain Professor Wegman, who claimed to have identified statistical flaws in the analysis underlying the original hockeystick. (Even if correct, that criticism has no bearing on the overall conclusion of Professor Mann’s paper or on the numerous independent hockeysticks produced by other researchers.) Professor Wegman subsequently published part of his report in the journal Computational Statistics and Data Analysis. Although normally a peer-reviewed journal, in this instance the paper was accepted a few days after submission, in July 2007, in an especially ironic twist as the paper tried to cast doubt on the quality of peer review in climate research. Alas, the paper’s lifetime was cut tragically short when it was officially withdrawn by the publisher a few weeks ago. Why? The paper by Wegman and colleagues was officially withdrawn because of substantial plagiarism. Conforming to the typical pattern of inversions, Wegman also appears to have plagiarized large parts of his initial hockeystick critique for Congressman Barton, while additionally distorting and misrepresenting many of the conclusions of the cited authors. We have examined just the tip of an iceberg of inversion of normal standards of ethics and scientific practice. These multiple departures from common scientific practice are not isolated incidents — on the contrary, they represent a common thread that permeates all of climate denial. Because climate denial is just that: denial, not scepticism. Science is inherently sceptical, and peer-review is the instrument by which scientific scepticism is pursued. Circumventing or subverting that process does not do justice to the public’s need for scientific accountability. At a time when Greenland is losing around 9,000 tonnes of ice every second — all of which contributes to sea level rises – it is time to hold accountable those who invert common standards of science, decency, and ethics in pursuit of their agenda to delay action on climate change.</em><br />

Background on Climate Change and Global Warming. Scientific assessments such as those of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States (e.g., National Research Council, 1975; 1979; 2001; 2006; 2008; 2010a; 2010b), the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have for decades consistently found with increasingly high scientific confidence that human activities are raising the concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, that this has a warming effect on the climate, that the climate is warming as expected, and that the changes so far are small compared to those projected if humans burn much of the fossil fuel on the planet. The basis for expecting and understanding warming from CO2 is the fundamental physics of how energy interacts with gases in the atmosphere. This knowledge has been available for over a century, was greatly refined by military research after World War II, and is directly confirmed by satellite measurements and other data (e.g., American Institute of Physics, 2008; Harries et al., 2001; Griggs and Harries, 2007). Although a great range of ideas can be found in scientific papers and in statements by individual scientists, the scientific assessments by bodies such as the National Academy of Sciences consider the full range of available information. The major results brought forward are based on multiple lines of evidence provided by different research groups with different funding sources, and have repeatedly been tested and confirmed. Removing the work of any scientist or small group of scientists would still leave a strong scientific basis for the main conclusions. Ice Changes. There exists increasingly strong evidence for widespread, ongoing reductions in the Earth's ice, including snow, river and lake ice, Arctic sea ice, permafrost and seasonally frozen ground, mountain glaciers, and the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. The trends from warming are modified by effects of changing precipitation and of natural variability, as I will discuss soon, so not all ice everywhere is always shrinking. Nonetheless, warming is important in the overall loss of ice, although changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation in response to natural or human causes also have contributed and will continue to contribute to changes. The most recent assessment by the IPCC remains relevant (Lemke et al., 2007). Also see the assessment of the long climatic history of the Arctic by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP, 2009), showing that in the past warming has led to shrinkage of Arctic ice including sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet, and that sufficiently large warming has removed them entirely.<br />

Warming makes disease and biodiversity loss inevitable- causes extinction and outweighs you impacts.<br />
Deibel 7 [Terry L., Professor of IR @ National War College, “Foreign Affairs Strategy: Logic for American Statecraft”, Conclusion: American Foreign Affairs Strategy Today <em>STRONG]</em><br />
<em>Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as prosperity) of a nonviolent nature, which, though far in the future, demands urgent action. It is the threat of global warming to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. Scientists worldwide have been observing the gathering of this threat for three decades now, and what was once a mere possibility has passed through probability to near certainty. Indeed not one of more than 900 articles on climate change published in refereed scientific journals from 1993 to 2003 doubted that anthropogenic warming is occurring. “In legitimate scientific circles,” writes Elizabeth Kolbert, “it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fundamentals of global warming.” Evidence from a vast international scientific monitoring effort accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: an international panel predicts “brutal droughts, floods and violent storms across the planet over the next century”; climate change could “literally alter ocean currents, wipe away huge portions of Alpine Snowcaps and aid the spread of cholera and malaria”; “glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and…worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than a decade ago”; “rising sea temperatures have been accompanied by a significant global increase in the most destructive hurricanes”; “NASA scientists have concluded from direct temperature measurements that 2005 was the hottest year on record, with 1998 a close second”; “Earth’s warming climate is estimated to contribute to more than 150,000 deaths and 5 million illnesses each year” as disease spreads; “widespread bleaching from Texas to Trinidad…killed broad swaths of corals” due to a 2-degree rise in sea temperatures. “The world is slowly disintegrating,” concluded Inuit hunter Noah Metuq, who lives 30 miles from the Arctic Circle. “They call it climate change…but we just call it breaking up.” From the founding of the first cities some 6,000 years ago until the beginning of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere remained relatively constant at about 280 parts per million (ppm). At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how serious the effects will be. As the newspaper stories quoted above show, we are already experiencing the effects of 1-2 degree warming in more violent storms, spread of disease, mass die offs of plants and animals, species extinction, and threatened inundation of low-lying countries like the Pacific nation of Kiribati and the Netherlands at a warming of 5 degrees or less the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida, and inundate Manhattan up to the middle of Greenwich Village. Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation that keeps the winter weather in Europe far warmer than its latitude would otherwise allow. Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system. At worst, says physics professor Marty Hoffert of New York University, “we’re just going to burn everything up; we’re going to heat the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, and then everything will collapse.” During the Cold War, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the Untied States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possibly end life on this planet. Global warming is the post-Cold War era’s equivalent of nuclear winter at least as serious and considerably better supported scientifically. Over the long run it puts dangers form terrorism and traditional military challenges to shame. It is a threat not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet.</em><br />

<em>Use the precautionary principle- irreversibility means solvency and positive feedback defense don’t matter</em><br />
<em>Sunstein 2007 [Cass R.—Professor in the Department of Political Science and at the Law School of the University of Chicago “Worst-Case Scenarios”, Harvard University Press, p. 176-177]</em><br />
<em>Most worst-case scenarios appear to have an element of irreversibility. Once a species is lost, it is lost forever. The special concern for endangered species stems from the permanence of their loss (outside of Jurassic Park). One of the most serious fears associated with genetically modified organisms is that they might lead to irreversible ecological harm. Because some greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for centuries, the problem of climate change may be irreversible, at least for all practical purposes. Transgenic crops can impose irreversible losses too, because they can make pests more resistant to pesticides. If we invest significant wealth in one source of energy and neglect others, we may be effectively stuck forever, or at least for a long time. One objection to capital punishment is that errors cannot be reversed. In ordinary life, our judgments about worst-case scenarios have everything to do with irreversibility. Of course an action may be hard but not impossible to undo, and so there may be a continuum of cases, with different degrees of difficulty in reversing. A marriage can be reversed, but divorce is rarely easy; having a child is very close to irreversible; moving from New York to Paris is reversible, but moving back may be difficult. People often take steps to avoid courses of action that are burdensome rather than literally impossible to reverse. In this light, we might identify an Irreversible Harm Precautionary Principle, applicable to a subset of risks.' As a rough first approximation, the principle says this: Special steps should be taken to avoid irreversible harms, through precautions that go well beyond those that would be taken if irreversibility were not a problem. The general attitude here is &quot;act, then learn,&quot; as opposed to the tempting alternative of &quot;wait and learn.&quot; In the case of climate change, some people believe that research should be our first line of defense. In their view, we should refuse to commit substantial resources to the problem until evidence of serious harm is unmistakably clear.' But even assuming that the evidence is not so clear, research without action allows greenhouse gas emissions to continue, which might produce risks that are irreversible, or at best difficult and expensive to reverse. For this reason, the best course of action might well be to take precautions now as a way of preserving flexibility for future generations. In the environmental context in general, this principle suggests that regulators should proceed with far more aggressive measures than would otherwise seem justified.</em><br />

<em>&quot;It is sometimes imagined that slow processes such as climate changes pose small risks, on the basis of the assumption that a choice can always be made to quickly reduce emissions and thereby reverse any harm within a few years or decades,&quot; the write. &quot;We have shown that this assumption is incorrect for carbon dioxide emissions, because of the longevity of the atmospheric CO2 perturbation and ocean warming. Irreversible climate changes due to carbon dioxide emissions have already taken place, and future carbon dioxide emissions would imply further irreversible effects on the planet, with attendant long legacies for choices made by contemporary society.&quot; &quot;In this paper we have quantified how societal decisions regarding carbon dioxide concentrations that have already occurred or could occur in the coming century imply irreversible dangers relating to climate change for some illustrative populations and regions. These and other dangers pose substantial challenges to humanity and nature, with a magnitude that is directly linked to the peak level of carbon dioxide reached.&quot;</em><br />

<em>The Energy Information Agency (EIA) of the US predicts that in the time between 2004 and 2030 the world's energy demand will almost double. An extra 8,500 GW of installed capacity is needed to meet the growing energy needs of an increasingly affluent and industrialized world. This amounts to 328 GW per year of installed baseload power generation. A typical terrestrial &quot;mega-nuclear&quot; plant having multiple reactors produces from 5 to 8 GW, takes 8 years to build, and costs 25 billion USD, or about 3.85 USD/watt. Worldwide, the translates into 1.25 trillion USD each year on power generation facilities. Renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric, wind, biomass, geothermal, and solar (passive, concentrated, and photovoltaic) are limited, according to the EIA. Even if fully utilitized and cost-effective, these sources are barely capable of meeting energy needs in 2030, but inadequate to meet the projected needs in 2050. Therefore, SSP needs to become a large and growing segment of mankind's power needs by no later than 2030. The Manhattan Project took 6 years, and the first nuclear reactor came 9 years later. The Apollo project also took 6 years, and routine space travel via the STS began 12 years after that. Thus, the latest date at which SSP work must be started is 2012. V. Conclusion SSP is the only renewable energy technology capable of meeting the projected worldwide demand for the next generation of humans, and all of their descendants. As the present stewards of the earth, there is a great onus on the present generation to start work on the ultimate solution as soon as possible. An ancient Chinese proverb advocates that we &quot;dig the well before we are thirsty&quot;. A law of the Native American society known as the Iroquois Nation is &quot;In every deliberation, we must consider the impact on the seventh generation&quot;. Benjamin Franklin's advice on addressing problems before they grow unmanageable is &quot;a stitch in time, saves nine.&quot; Grateful Dead lyrics by John Perry Barlow teach: &quot;We don't own this place, though we act as if we did; it's a loan from the children of our children's kids.&quot; While Americans individually can recognize the wisdom of these aphorisms, for the collective US nation to act accordingly will probably require a miracle.</em><br />

<em>The second cause of the coming climate wars is the flip side of scarcity: the problems of an increase in abundance. Suppose that global warming makes a precious resource easier to get at -- say, rising temperatures in northern Canada, Alaska and Siberia make it easier to get at oil and gas resources in regions that had previously been too bone-chilling to tap. (A few degrees of change in temperature can transform a previously inhospitable climate.) But what happens if some tempting new field pops up in international waters contested by two great powers? Or if smaller countries with murky borders start arguing over newly arable land? Finally, we should also worry about new conflicts over issues of sovereignty that we didn't need to deal with in our older, colder world. Consider the Northwest Passage, which is turning into an ice-free corridor from Europe to Asia during the summer months. Canada claims some portions of the route as its own sovereign waters, while the United States argues that these sections lie within international waters. Admittedly, it'd take a lot of tension for this to turn into a military conflict, but anyone convinced that the United States and Canada could never come to blows has forgotten the War of 1812. And not all this sort of resource conflict will occur between friendly countries. Other kinds of territorial quarrels will arise, too. Some remote islands -- particularly such Pacific islands as Tuvalu, Kiribati, Tonga, the Maldives and many others -- may be partially or entirely submerged beneath rising ocean waters. Do they lose their sovereignty if their territory disappears? After all, governments in exile have maintained sovereign rights in the past over land they didn't control (think of France and Poland in World War II). Nor are these new questions far away in the future. The first democratically elected president of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed, is already planning to use tourism revenue to buy land abroad -- perhaps in India, Sri Lanka or Australia -- to house his citizens. &quot;We do not want to leave the Maldives, but we also do not want to be climate refugees living in tents for decades,&quot; he told Britain's Guardian newspaper. The net result of these changes will be the creation of two geopolitical belts of tension due to global warming, which will dramatically shape the patterns of conflict in the 21st century. First, politics will heat up along what we might call the equatorial tension belt, a broad swath of instability around the planet's center. This belt will creep southward, deeper into Africa, and extend far into central Asia. Second, a new tension belt will develop around the polar circles. In the short term, the main problems will arise in the Northern Hemisphere, but later in the 21st century, the area around the South Pole may also see increasing security strains as countries rush to claim and develop heretofore frozen areas. If the equatorial tension belt includes mostly poor, developing countries fighting over survival, the new polar tension belt will draw in wealthy, developed countries fighting over opportunity. This is, admittedly, a glum view of the future. But we can still avoid the new hot wars -- or at least cool them down a bit. For starters, we should redouble our efforts to slow down global warming and undo the damage humanity has already done to the environment. Every little bit helps, so by all means, hassle your senator and recycle those bottles. Beyond that, we need to get our heads around the idea that global warming is one of the most serious long-term threats to our national and personal security. For the next two decades or so, the climate will continue to change: Historic levels of built-up greenhouse gases will continue to warm the world -- and spin it toward new patterns of conflict. So we need to do more than simply reverse climate change. We need to understand and react to it -- ordinary people and governments alike -- in ways that avoid conflict. Over the next few years, we may find that climate-change accords and peace treaties start to overlap more and more. And we may find that global warming is heating new conflicts up to the boiling point.</em><br />

AS we face $4.50 a gallon gas, we also know that alternative energy sources — coal, oil shale, ethanol, wind and ground-based solar — are either of limited potential, very expensive, require huge energy storage systems or harm the environment. There is, however, one potential future energy source that is environmentally friendly, has essentially unlimited potential and can be cost competitive with any renewable source: space solar power. Science fiction? Actually, no — the technology already exists. A space solar power system would involve building large solar energy collectors in orbit around the Earth. These panels would collect far more energy than land-based units, which are hampered by weather, low angles of the sun in northern climes and, of course, the darkness of night. Once collected, the solar energy would be safely beamed to Earth via wireless radio transmission, where it would be received by antennas near cities and other places where large amounts of power are used. The received energy would then be converted to electric power for distribution over the existing grid. Government scientists have projected that the cost of electric power generation from such a system could be as low as 8 to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is within the range of what consumers pay now. In terms of cost effectiveness, the two stumbling blocks for space solar power have been the expense of launching the collectors and the efficiency of their solar cells. Fortunately, the recent development of thinner, lighter and much higher efficiency solar cells promises to make sending them into space less expensive and return of energy much greater. Much of the progress has come in the private sector. Companies like Space Exploration Technologies and Orbital Sciences, working in conjunction with NASA’s public-private Commercial Orbital Transportation Services initiative, have been developing the capacity for very low cost launchings to the International Space Station. This same technology could be adapted to sending up a solar power satellite system.<br />

<em>SPECIAL POLICY FEATURES OF THE SPACE POWER GRID 1. Global Collaboration Model Such a system involving global power exchange obviously requires global collaboration. It spans many of the issues in building Space infrastructure, and international collaboration for ground infrastructure and energy trading. ROI large enough to attract private capital is not realistic because of the large risk. Public financing is also needed to ensure serious intent on the part of governments to complete the project. The SPG involves placing a substantial number of satellites into low/mid earth orbit, and several large ultralight collectors into high orbits. There will be powerful beams of energy crisscrossing between these. Cooperative regulation could be modeled after the various UN agreements that allot orbit sectors and frequency bandwidth to nations to enable the communication satellites, the GPS, Galileo and Glonass global positioning systems. A global solar power grid in Space should meet with support from all the spacefaring nations, and from most non-spacefaring nations. Already, apart from the US and Europe, Japan, which has few fossil power resources, has a very strong program[24,25] for space solar power. China has been tapped by the European Union for participation in a power grid. Russia, China, Africa and Australia have vast undeveloped areas that are suitable for renewable power generation but lack terrestrial power grids, while the many island nations of the world would benefit from beamed power as a replacement for fossil power. India, with a growing space program, has already invested heavily in microwave infrastructure for communications, and should be amenable to converting some of that to power beaming purposes. With the next round of the Climate Control global agreement due in 2013, consensus appears to have emerged on the issues confronting nations, as well as the possibility of concerted global action. This generates a climate ripe for undertaking the massive collaborative effort that can lead to true energy independence.</em><br />

FINDING: The SBSP Study Group found that SBSP offers a path to address the concerns over US intellectual competitiveness in math and the physical sciences expressed by the Rising Above the Gathering Storm report by providing a true “Manhattan or Apollo project for energy.” In absolute scale and implications, it is likely that SBSP would ultimately exceed both the Manhattan and Apollo projects which established significant workforces and helped the US maintain its technical and competitive lead. The committee expressed it was “deeply concerned that the scientific and technological building blocks critical to our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength.” SBSP would require a substantial technical workforce of high‐paying jobs. It would require expanded technical education opportunities, and directly support the underlying aims of the American Competitiveness Initiative. FINDING: The SBSP Study Group found that SBSP directly addresses the concerns of the Presidential Aerospace Commission which called on the US to become a true spacefaring civilization and to pay closer attention to our aerospace technical and industrial base, our “national jewel” which has enhanced our security, wealth, travel, and lifestyle. An SBSP program as outlined in this report is remarkably consonant with the findings of this commission, which stated: The United States must maintain its preeminence in aerospace research and innovation to be the global aerospace leader in the 21st century. This can only be achieved through proactive government policies and sustained public investments in long‐term research and RDT&amp;E infrastructure that will result in new breakthrough aerospace capabilities. Over the last several decades, the U.S. aerospace sector has been living off the research investments made primarily for defense during the Cold War…Government policies and investments in long‐term research have not kept pace with the changing world. Our nation does not have bold national aerospace technology goals to focus and sustain federal research and related infrastructure investments. The nation needs to capitalize on these opportunities, and the federal government needs to lead the effort. Specifically, it needs to invest in long‐term enabling research and related RDT&amp;E infrastructure, establish national aerospace technology demonstration goals, and create an environment that fosters innovation and provide the incentives necessary to encourage risk taking and rapid introduction of new products and services. The Aerospace Commission recognized that Global U.S. aerospace leadership can only be achieved through investments in our future, including our industrial base, workforce, long term research and national infrastructure, and that government must commit to increased and sustained investment and must facilitate private investment in our national aerospace sector. The Commission concluded that the nation will have to be a space‐faring nation in order to be the global leader in the 21st century—that our freedom, mobility, and quality of life will depend on it, and therefore, recommended that the United States boldly pioneer new frontiers in aerospace technology, commerce and exploration. They explicitly recommended hat the United States create a space imperative and that NASA and DoD need to make the investments necessary for developing and supporting future launch capabilities to revitalize U.S. space launch infrastructure, as well as provide Incentives to Commercial Space. The report called on government and the investment community must become more sensitive to commercial opportunities and problems in space. Recognizing the new realities of a highly dynamic, competitive and global marketplace, the report noted that the federal government is dysfunctional when addressing 21st century issues from a long term, national and global perspective. It suggested an increase in public funding for long term research and supporting infrastructure and an acceleration of transition of government research to the aerospace sector, recognizing that government must assist industry by providing insight into its long‐term research programs, and industry needs to provide to government on its research priorities. It urged the federal government must remove unnecessary barriers to international sales of defense products, and implement other initiatives that strengthen transnational partnerships to enhance national security, noting that U.S. national security and procurement policies represent some of the most burdensome restrictions affecting U.S. industry competitiveness. Private‐public partnerships were also to be encouraged. It also noted that without constant vigilance and investment, vital capabilities in our defense industrial base will be lost, and so recommended a fenced amount of research and development budget, and significantly increase in the investment in basic aerospace research to increase opportunities to gain experience in the workforce by enabling breakthrough aerospace capabilities through continuous development of new experimental systems with or without a requirement for production. Such experimentation was deemed to be essential to sustain the critical skills to conceive, develop, manufacture and maintain advanced systems and potentially provide expanded capability to the warfighter. A top priority was increased investment in basic aerospace research which fosters an efficient, secure, and safe aerospace transportation system, and suggested the establishment of national technology demonstration goals, which included reducing the cost and time to space by 50%. It concluded that, “America must exploit and explore space to assure national and planetary security, economic benefit and scientific discovery. At the same time, the United States must overcome the obstacles that jeopardize its ability to sustain leadership in space.” An SBSP program would be a powerful expression of this imperative.<br />

<em>It has become increasingly evident that facing and solving the multiple issues concerning energy is the single most pressing problem that we face as a species. In recent years, there has been extensive debate and media coverage about alternative energy, sustainable development and global climate change, but what has been missing (at least in the mainstream media) is the knowledge and point of view of scientists and engineers. From the scientists or engineers perspective, this paper discusses the prospects for mankind's technological capability and societal will in harnessing solar energy, and focuses on the issues of: 1) space based solar power (SBSP) development, and, 2) why it is imperative that we must harness the unparalleled power of the sun in a massive and unprecedented scale, which I believe will be humanity's next giant leap forward. Solar Power from a Historic Perspective Whether terrestrially based or space based, solar energy has not yet emerged as a significant solution in public discussions of global warming. Yet, among scientists and engineers and other visionaries, it is starting to be viewed as one of the most promising and viable ways to eventually remove human dependence on fossil fuels. Nearly three years ago at the Foundation For the Future (FFF) International Energy Conference, my presentation was one of the few that took a look back at energy use in human history[1]. In this paper, I would like to offer a brief summary of the various stages mankind has passed through in our quest for energy, and how long they lasted. To understand and fully appreciate the profound idea that humankind has and can continue to harness sun's energy, it is imperative for us to learn from the history of our civilization and from the perspective of human evolution, especially from those societies in crisis over energy. Previewing the history of human energy consumption and energy technologies, we can see that there were three such eras. In the early years of human presence on this planet, we relied on wood-generated energy, based on the burning of firewood, tree branches and the remains of agricultural harvests. Starting in the 1600s, our forefathers discovered the energy properties of coal, which taught us how to tap stored supplies of fossil fuels. Less than two hundred years later, about the middle of the 1800s, we found petroleum and learned to commercialize the use of oil and gas, which brought about our current industrial civilization. In the 20th century, society witnessed the dawn of electricity generation via hydro-power and atomic energy. Today, demand for energy continues to soar, but we're rapidly using up our supplies of easily accessible fossil fuels. What is more, a profound environmental crisis has emerged as the result of our total reliance on energy sources based on those fuels. In the 21st century, there is great uncertainty about world energy supplies. If you plot energy demand by year of human civilization on a terawatt scale, you will see the huge bump that occurred barely a hundred years ago (Figure 1). Before that, in the Stone Age, basically the cultivation of fire led to the emergence of agriculture, cooking, tool making, and all the early stages of human civilization. Now, after about 150 years of burning fossil fuels, the earth's 3 billion years' store of solar energy has been plundered. In my view, mankind must now embark on the next era of sustainable energy consumption and re-supply. The most obvious source of which is the mighty energy resource of our sun. Adequately guide and using human creativity and innovation; the 21st century will become the next great leap forward in human civilization by taming solar energy, transforming our combustion world economy into a lasting solar-electric world economy. In solving humanity's energy problems we must learn from our ancestors. Taming the natural forces of the sun will be much like our ancestors' early efforts to harness the power of wild fire. We must use common sense, as they did, developing the tools and technologies that address the needs of our time. The Romans used flaming oil containers to destroy the Saracen fleet in 670. In the same century, the Japanese were digging wells to a depth approaching 900 feet with picks and shovels in search of oil. By 1100, the Chinese had reached depths of more than 3,000 feet in search of energy. This happened centuries before the West had sunk its first commercial well in 1859 in Titusville, Pennsylvania. With all such human creativities in the past, the searching for energy has been driven by our combustion world economy, which focused primarily on what's beneath the surface of our planet - the secondary energy resources which originated from the power of our sun. Now it's time for mankind to lift their heads and start focusing our profound creativity in harnessing the sun and making our way into the energy technology frontiers in the sky. Solar Energy - The Ultimate Answer to Anthropogenic Climate Change. The evidence of global warming is alarming. The potential for a catastrophic climate change scenario is dire. Until recently, I worked at Goddard Space Flight Center, a NASA research center in the forefront of space and earth science research. This Center is engaged in monitoring and analyzing climate changes on a global scale. I received first hand scientific information and data relating to global warming issues, including the latest dynamics of ice cap melting and changes that occurred on either pole of our planet. I had the chance to discuss this research with my Goddard colleagues, who are world leading experts on the subject. I now have no doubt global temperatures are rising, and that global warming is a serious problem confronting all of humanity. No matter whether these trends are due to human interference or to the cosmic cycling of our solar system, there are two basic facts that are crystal clear: a) there is overwhelming scientific evidence showing positive correlations between the level of CO2concentrations in the earth's atmosphere with respect to the historical fluctuations of global temperature changes; and b) the overwhelming majority of the world's scientific community is in agreement about the risks of a potential catastrophic global climate change. That is, if we humans continue to ignore this problem and do nothing, if we continue dumping huge quantities of greenhouse gases into earth's biosphere, humanity will be at dire risk. As a technical and technology risk assessment expert, I could show with confidence that we face orders of magnitude more risk doing nothing to curb our fossil-based energy addictions than we will in making a fundamental shift in our energy supply. This is because the risks of a catastrophic anthropogenic climate change can be potentially the extinction of human species, a risk that is simply too high for us to take any chances. Of course, there will be economic consequences to all societies when we restrict the burning of fossil fuels in an effort to abate &quot;global warming.&quot; What we are talking about are options and choices between risks. All human activities involve risk taking; we cannot avoid risks but only make trade-offs, hopefully choosing wisely. In this case, there has to be a risk-based probabilistic thought process when it comes to adopting national or international policies in dealing with global warming and energy issues. As the measure of risk is a product of &quot;likelihood&quot; and &quot;consequence,&quot; when consequence or risk of a potential human extinction (due to catastrophic climate change) is to be compared with the potential consequence or risk of loss of jobs or slowing the growth of economy (due to restriction of fossil-based energy consumption), I believe the choice is clear. My view is that by making a paradigm shift in the world's energy supply over time through extensive R&amp;D, technology innovations and increased production of renewable energy, we will create countless new careers and jobs and end up triggering the next level of economic development, the kind of pollution free industrial revolution mankind has never before seen. The aggravation and acceleration of a potential anthropogenic catastrophic global climate change, in my opinion, is the number one risk incurred from our combustion-based world economy. At the International Energy Conference in Seattle, I showed three pairs of satellite images as evidence that the earth glaciers are disappearing at an alarming rate.[2] Whether this warming trend can be reversed by human intervention is not clear, but this uncertainty in risk reduction doesn't justify the human inactions in adapting policies and countermeasures on renewable energy development for a sustainable world economy, and for curbing the likelihood of any risk event of anthropogenic catastrophic climate changes. What is imperative is that we start to do something in a significant way that has a chance to make a difference. Solar Power - The Best Renewable Energy Source for the Future Now mankind faces an energy crossroad. As a species, we have basically two directions in our quest for energy: 1) either we look for energy based on cosmic-based, open and unlimited original resources, which means everything comes from the stars, from the sun, or 2) we continue to rely on earth-based, local and confined secondary energy resources. There is no secret that every single bit of energy on this planet comes from the sun. In my view, we have a small window of opportunity over the next couple of decades. Either we're going to go down or we're going to go up as a species. The direction we follow largely depends upon how we approach our energy challenge. Learning how to harness our sun for solutions to our energy problems will not be unlike our ancestors harnessing the wild fire. I believe it will lead to an inevitable leapfrog in the process of human evolution. Bill Michael, a University of Chicago professor, wrote &quot;Use of fire illustrates that human evolution is a gradual process; modern humans did not emerge overnight in a 'big bang' of development, but rather slowly adapted from their primitive origins. The use of fire by humans throughout time to overcome environmental forces is a fundamental and defining aspect of human nature.&quot;[3]</em><br />

Since neither the DOE nor NASA considers space solar power to be in its mandate and each refuses to fund its development, maybe it is time for Americans to consider whether there are other U.S. government agencies that might see these developments within their mandate.<br />
The Department of Commerce is an agency that deals with space and is concerned about the nation's energy future. The Commerce Department currently hosts the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of the world's largest civilian space agencies. Commerce is concerned with all aspects of the U.S. economy and energy definitely affects the US economy. The Department of Commerce is the perfect agency to take the lead on space solar power. From its Web site, one can see that Commerce's mission includes &quot;promoting the Nation's economic and technological advancement,&quot; &quot;strengthening the international economic position of the United States,&quot; &quot;improving comprehension and uses of the physical environment,&quot; and &quot;ensuring effective use and growth of the Nation's scientific and technical resources.&quot; Space solar power development will be key to U.S. future economic and technological development. SPS is an excellent example of a way to help strengthen our international economic position, to improve use of our physical environment and effectively exploit our scientific and technical resources. Space solar power is clearly within the mandate of the Department of Commerce. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke is in a good position from which to champion space solar power development. He was the two-time governor of the State of Washington; thus is very aware of the importance of aerospace to the U.S. economy since Boeing is a pillar of the state's economy. He has strong leadership skills. The Commerce Department currently hosts the Office of Space Commercialization, National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology, National Telecommunications &amp; Information Administration, National Technical Information Service and Economic Development Administration. All of these can be expected to contribute to and benefit from the effort to develop a system of Solar Power Satellites. The Office of Space Commercialization is presently the only civilian government group interested in space solar power. The Department of Commerce has a history of cooperation with both DOE and NASA. Today, NOAA works closely with NASA on its weather satellite launches. Gary Locke and Dr. Steven Chu, Secretary of the Department of Energy, work together well, making many joint appearances. If Commerce will fund SSP development, the issue of launch costs will still need to be addressed. Launching satellites and related materials into space has remained extremely expensive for decades because the current market isn't big enough to justify the major investment required to develop new technology. Given the potential size of this new energy source, it would make sense for the US government to put money into R&amp;D. It would also help if the government subsidized launch costs for the first four full scale solar power satellites in return for a percent of the power produced for the life of the satellite. This could help to get the energy market moving in the direction of space. It may also help to address some of the power needs of our Department of Defense.<br />
Space solar power is stuck because of two dilemmas, the difficulty of finding an agency to fund space solar power and high launch costs. NASA considers space solar power to be energy and the Department of Energy considers space solar power to be space. Space solar power has such huge launch demands that present launch costs make it unaffordable. Part of the reason that launch costs are so high is that the launch market is small. Since the market for solar energy from space is huge, the U.S. government should subsidize the launch of the initial four solar power satellites to drive the launch industry to a new level of capability. The Department of Commerce should be given authority to take the lead in space solar power development. Space solar power has no serious technical issues standing in its way, but it is facing crippling policy dilemmas. By taking a new policy approach, we may be able to get out of a decades-long quagmire. Energy and space are within the mandate of the Department of Commerce. Help with the deployment of four full scale space solar power satellites will incentivize the launch industry to develop new technologies and more efficient techniques and facilities. The time is now for the development of space solar power. If the U.S. government commits to it as a matter of public policy, a new SPS industry will emerge, repaying the public investment many times over. If the U.S. does not do so, Japan, China, India or Russia will take the lead in space solar power development and the U.S. will continue to send billions of dollars a year abroad to insure that our energy needs are met.<br />

<strong>1. Robots are a form of human presence</strong><br />

Ryan, The Space Review, 8/31, “Giving NASA a clear mission”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1456/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1456/1</a>)<br />
<span style="color: black;">If neither technology-oriented nor destination-oriented objectives seem able to provide a sense of direction to guide the nation’s efforts in space, then what can? To approach this question, it is useful to ask why President Kennedy’s challenge to go to the Moon was so effective in providing NASA with leadership. The critical element of this challenge that, although never explicit, was so important to NASA’s health and growth during this period was the transformation—at least in fact, if not in law—into an exploration agency. If we wish to see NASA act effectively as a space exploration agency, then the most direct way to do this is to amend the Space Act to explicitly task the agency with the job of space exploration. However, before we do so, we must define what space exploration actually </span><em><span style="color: black;">is</span></em><span style="color: black;">. <em>Space exploration is the expansion of human influence in space.</em> This definition of exploration is inherently one of capacity building. Human influence in space is a measure of our ability to do useful things beyond the Earth’s surface. In order to do something useful, there has to be some sort of human presence, either humans themselves or their robotic proxies. Once some measure of human influence has been established at some destination in space, there are two ways a space exploration agency can </span><em><span style="color: black;">expand</span></em><span style="color: black;"> that influence. One, the agency can decrease the costs and increase the benefits of human influence at a given location until such influence becomes sufficiently useful that it is economically self-sustaining, at which point continued use of agency resources is unnecessary. Alternately, human influence can be extended to some new place that may in future become home to some form of self-supporting human influence. The key element is that such a mandate compels each step to build on past accomplishments and lay the groundwork for future missions.</span><br />

On February 1, 2003, all seven crew members of the Columbia space shuttle died in a midair disintegration accident. The accident investigation committee concluded that heat-insulating foam fell oﬀ the external tank and damaged the thermal protection tiles on the leading edge of the left wing. Hot gas entered the left wing during atmospheric reentry causing the midair disintegration. After the Columbia accident, NASA suspended shuttle launches. Consequently, the operation period of the International Space Station (ISS), which is due to be completed in 2010, may be extended for various reasons. Extending the ISS operation period may require maintenance, improvements, and repair to damage caused by collisions with debris. When considering ambitious future space development programs, such as the construction of a lunar base, solar power satellites, and other space structures, we clearly need to establish safe space welding and processing technologies.<br />

What is Space Exploration?<br />
Science and exploration both have their origin in the human curiosity and desire to understand the world around us, which is one of the driving forces for the cultural evolution and prosperity of mankind. Obviously, the exploration idea has its roots in the exploration and colonization of our Earth, including its many inhospitable regions. The history of humankind shows that societies and individuals need challenges to advance, otherwise they stagnate and decay in the long run. An impressive example is the decay of the Ming Empire of China, which around 1400 AD was the most powerful and knowledgeable nation on Earth. Their advanced ships had explored the oceans up to the east coast of Africa and were about to discover Europe, when all activities were stopped by the Confucian bureaucrats because they were deemed useless. Another driving force for scientific and technological progress is war, but it is hoped that humankind is on the verge to overcome this inhumane threat. Space exploration aims at expanding the present frontiers for human access to the solar system and beyond (both via robots and humans), relying on human experience and involvement and creating emotions and exceptional public interest (Fig. 1). The objective is to look for unknown and fascinating phenomena (incl. landscapes not previously encountered, search for life, etc.), raising new scientific questions, or opening up new fields of applications and commercial utilization (e.g. in-situ resources, tourism). Exploration of space is particularly demanding, since it involves hostile environments and requires sophisticated and thus expensive technologies. Therefore, it should be achieved stepwise: initially by robots, substituting humans and transmitting their findings to Earth (with all the resulting limitations), and later by human presence. This approach seems reasonable in order to prepare and validate the necessary technologies, and to find out the landing sites most interesting for detailed studies by humans. In fact, it has been chosen in the frame of the Apollo Moon landings and is currently pursued in NASA’s Mars exploration program. In this approach, missions like Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover (MER), which are also spectacular as stand-alone planetary science missions, can be considered as precursors for human landings. Within the foreseeable future, robots can not fully replace humans who are able to react flexibly and make decisions in unexpected situations. On Earth, for example, it is unimaginable that geologic field exploration could be done without humans. It should be kept in mind, however, that human missions may comprise more than just science and technology driven rationales, e.g., philosophical, ethical, and political aspects<br />

What to do? There are few easy answers. However, the history of US exploration offers insight about places we can start.<br />
First, we should accept that “exploration” is a multivalent term, with many meanings, some of which are contradictory, and all of which have historical precedent. For too long we have looked at the history of exploration selectively, seeking to find the antecedents which justify our own vision of exploration: as science, as human adventure, as geopolitical statement. This is a definitional fight which cannot be won. Space policy must acknowledge the multiple visions for space exploration, developing a clear-eyed metric of value which avoids the vagaries of lofty “exploration-speak”. If the merits of human exploration of the Moon and Mars are primarily symbolic and geopolitical, what are these goals worth in terms of federal funding? What are costs and benefits of missions developed to express “soft power” vs. science? Finally, which goals or combination of goals offers the best chance of long-term buy-in by the taxpayer? While historical precedent defines exploration in terms of human explorers who travel to new destinations, that definition is woefully obsolete with regard to discovery in an era in which teleoperation offers virtual presence for explorers who remain on the surface of the Earth. As has been pointed out by many authors, “robots” have come to be less personal assistants who follow us dutifully, and more expendable extensions of our senses. In this respect, science can be viewed as arguably the most important frontier for humankind, and whether it is done by humans in situ or by humans remotely is no longer a particularly relevant distinction.<br />

Conversely, the most “time efficient” means is just the opposite. As America and the rest of the industrialized world has become addicted to “just in time” and “overnight” delivery of every imaginable commodity, so has DoD.

<u>Today the international situation is also one of high risk. • The terrorists who would like to kill Americans on U.S. soil constantly search for safe havens from which to plan and carry out their attacks.</u> American military actions in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen, and elsewhere make it harder for them to strike and are a large part of the reason why for almost a decade there has been no repetition of September 11. To the degree that we limit our ability to deny them safe haven, we increase the chances they will succeed. • <u>American forces deployed in East Asia and the Western Pacific have for decades prevented the outbreak of major war, provided stability, and kept open international trading routes, making possible an unprecedented era of growth and prosperity for Asians and Americans alike. Now the United States faces a new challenge and potential threat from a rising China which seeks eventually to push the U.S. military’s area of operations back to Hawaii and exercise hegemony over the world’s most rapidly growing economies.</u> <u>Meanwhile, a nuclear-armed North Korea threatens war with South Korea and fires ballistic missiles over Japan that will someday be capable of reaching the west coast of the United States. Democratic nations in the region, worried that the United States may be losing influence, turn to Washington for reassurance that the U.S. security guarantee remains firm.</u> <u>If the United States cannot provide that assurance because it is cutting back its military capabilities, they will have to choose between accepting Chinese dominance and striking out on their own, possibly by building nuclear weapons.</u> • In the Middle East, Iran seeks to build its own nuclear arsenal, supports armed radical Islamic groups in Lebanon and Palestine, and has linked up with anti-American dictatorships in the Western Hemisphere. The prospects of new instability in the region grow every day as a decrepit regime in Egypt clings to power, crushes all moderate opposition, and drives the Muslim Brotherhood into the streets. A nuclear-armed Pakistan seems to be ever on the brink of collapse into anarchy and radicalism. Turkey, once an ally, now seems bent on an increasingly anti-American Islamist course. The prospect of war between Hezbollah and Israel grows, and with it the possibility of war between Israel and Syria and possibly Iran. <u>There, too, nations in the region increasingly look to Washington for reassurance, and if they decide the United States cannot be relied upon they will have to decide whether to succumb to Iranian influence or build their own nuclear weapons to resist it.</u> In the 1990s, after the Soviet Union had collapsed and the biggest problem in the world seemed to be ethnic conflict in the Balkans, it was at least plausible to talk about cutting back on American military capabilities. <u>In the present, increasingly dangerous international environment, in which terrorism and great power rivalry vie as the greatest threat to American security and interests, cutting military capacities is simply reckless. Would we increase the risk of strategic failure in an already risky world, despite the near irrelevance of the defense budget to American fiscal health, just so we could tell American voters that their military had suffered its “fair share” of the pain?</u> The nature of the risk becomes plain when one considers the nature of the cuts that would have to be made to have even a marginal effect on the U.S. fiscal crisis. Many are under the illusion, for instance, that if the United States simply withdrew from Iraq and Afghanistan and didn’t intervene anywhere else for a while, this would have a significant impact on future deficits. But, in fact, projections of future massive deficits already assume the winding down of these interventions. Withdrawal from the two wars would scarcely make a dent in the fiscal crisis. Nor can meaningful reductions be achieved by cutting back on waste at the Pentagon—which Secretary of Defense Gates has already begun to do and which has also been factored into deficit projections. If the United States withdrew from Iran and Afghanistan tomorrow, cut all the waste Gates can find, and even eliminated a few weapons programs—all this together would still not produce a 10 percent decrease in overall defense spending. In fact, the only way to get significant savings from the defense budget—and by “significant,” we are still talking about a tiny fraction of the cuts needed to bring down future deficits—is to cut force structure: fewer troops on the ground; fewer airplanes in the skies; fewer ships in the water; fewer soldiers, pilots, and sailors to feed and clothe and provide benefits for. To cut the size of the force, however, requires reducing or eliminating the missions those forces have been performing. Of course, there are any number of think tank experts who insist U.S. forces can be cut by a quarter or third or even by half and still perform those missions. But this is snake oil. Over the past two decades, the force has already been cut by a third. Yet no administration has reduced the missions that the larger force structures of the past were designed to meet. <u>To fulfill existing security commitments, to remain the “world’s power balancer of choice,” as Leslie Gelb puts it, to act as “the only regional balancer against China in Asia, Russia in eastern Europe, and Iran in the Middle East” requires at least the current force structure, and almost certainly more than current force levels. Those who recommend doing the same with less are only proposing a policy of insufficiency, where the United States makes commitments it cannot meet except at high risk of failure.</u><br />

Greater situational awareness through enhanced monitoring and surveillance in space is also crucial to this idea of defense in space. One of the driving forces behind China’s efforts to research space debris identification and tracking is to also improve China’s ability to monitor military assets.68 The ability to identify and discriminate objects in space is crucial to evaluating threats from non-threats in space. The above constitute ‘comprehensive defensive actions,’ centered on capabilities to enhance survivability of China’s satellite networks, and ensure China’s access to space that is considered indispensable for future ‘informationalized warfare.’69 At the heart of this defensive strategy is the need to protect against an adversary’s ability to prevent or restrict China from using space to its economic and national security advantage; that is, the ability to ‘deny the denial.’ It is the dual-use nature of China’s satellite program that will provide the means to achieve that comprehensive defense in space. For example, China’s plan to increase indigenous development and production capacity of durable and miniaturized satellites for missions of data transmission and Earth remote sensing is aimed primarily at civilian and commercial purposes. However, such technologies offer lower cost access to space with greater maneuverability and thus would have a direct impact on military space capability. China also intends to increase its capacity to launch on demand and achieve launch redundancy,70 which also could markedly enhance its military space potential<strong>.</strong> Chinese slogans such as ‘applying military to civilian,’ and ‘integrating military and civilian’ are used in official discussions to stress the integration and embedding of military with civilian technology development and production.71 Since the early 1990s, the revolution in military affairs has been the central theme for China’s military modernization program, of which space is an indispensable part.72 Such notions indicate the importance of a dual-use strategy. As for existent capabilities in space, although there is no official admission, China does have satellites for navigation, remote sensing, reconnaissance and communication that have military uses.73 These are mainly for ‘power enhancement and support’ capabilities. However, as others have noted, they remain vastly insufficient for gaining any real advantage vis-à-vis U.S. dominance in space74. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the number of these assets would Eric Hagt ~95~ grow substantially under the planned satellite development program and thus rapidly improve China’s force enabling capacity.<br />

The whole game is counter –productive and result in more ‘Mutually Assured Destruction’ ( MAD ) as with nuclear weapon</u>s ….but not in the minds of the Transnational capitalist class which loves the Midas touch . <u>The ‘Outer Space Treaty 1967 , was signed and sealed by the US , Soviet Union , China and India among others . The Outer Space treaty is a legally binding instrument . however it has a caveat ,which by omission permits the ‘passive military use of space .</u>’ The Prime Ministers of Canada and Russia at the Millenium Summit in September 2000 and again in a meeting in December 2000 promised to work in close cooperation to prevent an arms race in Space. In a well reasoned paper presented to a Conference on Disarmament in Space , held in Moscow in 2001 , Dr Rebecca Johnson , Executive Director of the Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy called for a step by step ‘Ottawa Process’ and referred to a constructive working paper tabled by France at the Conference on Disarmament ( CD ) in Geneva. Dr Rebecca Johnson also suggested that a number of American companies with interests in Telecom , Navigation and Entertainment industries have a stake in keeping Space peaceful <u>. She made another relevant observation that ‘Demilitarisation of Space is linked to ‘Demilitarisation of International Relations.’</u> Recalling Srilanka’s contribution to a proposed moratorium on testing ASAT weapons and for a discussion on a ‘Rules of the Road’ for Space in an attempt to pre-empt weaponisation of Space; the Srilankan ambassador to the CD , Geneva , Jayantha Dhanapala , as early as 1985, emphasized with rare foresight that “preventing an arms race in outer space is an easier task than attempting to control and decelerate such a race after it has begun... therefore, the urgency, to prohibit through multi-lateral negotiations the stationing of weapons in space designed to damage , destroy or interfere with any country’s space craft.” It would be ideal if the BMD and NMD projects are also halted , if not on the realization of their practical futility , then simply because the coming ‘Greatest Depression’ must lead to a major review and recall on grounds of financial non-feasibility alone. An eminent thinker and analyst in the global network for preservation of the space sanctuary has spoken thus : “ It wont do much good to anti-war people to demand an end to the war in Iraq, Afghanistan , nuclear war , <u>weaponisation of Space</u> ….unless they ( we ) mobilize the millions to demand the end of the underlying system , profit is all the human being nothing, that <u>has now produced quasi-permanent war , conflict, violence, tension and sectarian strife</u> (death squads and PMC personnel masquerading as Special Operation Groups with remote control drone bombers outside the control of any democratic institution of the State system / apparatus <u>.)” We are threatened with the destruction and decimation of peoples and nations the world over , including the destruction of the life-sustaining resources of mother earth .</u><br />

SSP solves asteroids<br />
Hempsella, 2006 (Mark, professor at University of Bristol, “Space power as a response to global catastrophes,” Acta Astronautica, Volume 59, Issue 7, October 2006, Pages 524-530, EBSCO host)<br />
Large near-Earth object impacts, while they are comparatively rare compared to calderia volcanoes as a natural initiator of global catastrophes, are of special interest as sufficient space capability would enable deflection of destruction of the incoming object—thus fully preventing the catastrophe. This has been the subject of considerable recent literature and while many different approaches have been proposed all of them require a considerably greater space infrastructure than currently available. The size of asteroid required to create a global catastrophe is a matter of some debate. Harrison et al. [21] suggest that 1 km size object is just below a threshold where global effects could cause a catastrophe level event. Whereas Rigby et al<span class="Underline">.</span> [22] <span class="Underline">argue a 1 km object could have caused the Dark Ages in the 6th Century</span> AD. So <span class="Underline">a system capable of handling a 1 km object would be the minimum required to deal with potential global catastrophe level events.</span> The size of system that could deflect a NEO sufficiently to avoid collision with the Earth is also uncertain and is strongly dependent upon the assumptions made on size, orbit and timescale. A small asteroid with centuries until the potential impact may be deflected sufficiently by a single nuclear device (e.g. [23]), which is probably just about possible with the current space infrastructure. However, <span class="Underline">a large comet with only a year or two warning would require systems well beyond current capability. There have been proposals for large orbital systems to deflect asteroids</span> for example that outlined by Campbell et al. [24]. <span class="Underline">To deflect an</span> iron <span class="Underline">asteroid using a pulsed laser was estimated to need peak powers</span> of 200 GW, which would correspond to a continuous power supply requirement in the order of 20 GW. <span class="Underline">This is the output of two reference SPS satellites giving a good indication of the size of system required for this technique.</span> One suggested location was a Sun Earth Lagrange point.<br />

Once upon a time there was a Big Bang... Cause/Effect - Cause/Effect -Cause/Effect and fifteen billion years later we have this chunk of cosmos weighing in at a couple trillion tons, screaming around our solar system, somewhere, hair on fire at a million miles a day, on course to the subjective center of the universe. <span class="Underline">Left to its own fate</span> -- <span class="Underline">on impact -- this Rock would release the kinetic energy equivalent of one Hiroshima bomb for every man, woman and child on the planet. Game Over</span>... No Joy... Restart Darwin's clock… again. No happy ever after. <span class="Underline">There is simply no empirical logic or rational argument that this could not be the next asteroid to strike Earth or that the next impact event could not happen </span><em><u>tomorrow</u></em>. And as things stand we can only imagine a handful of dubious undeveloped and untested possibilities to defend ourselves with. There is nothing we have actually prepared to do in response to this event. From an empirical analysis of the dynamics and geometry of our solar system we have come to understand that the prospect of an Earth/asteroid collision is a primal and ongoing process: a solar systemic status quo that is unlikely to change in the lifetime of our species. And that <span class="Underline">the distribution of these</span> impact <span class="Underline">events is completely aperiodic</span> and random both their occasion and magnitude. From abstracted averaged relative frequency estimates we can project that over the course of the next 500 million years in the life of Earth we will be struck by approximately 100,000 asteroids that will warrant our consideration. <span class="Underline">Most will be relatively small, 100 to 1,000 meters in diameter, millions of tons: only major city to nation killers. 1,000</span> or so <span class="Underline">will be</span> over 1,000 meters, billions of tons and <span class="Underline">large enough to do </span>catastrophic and potentially <span class="Underline">irrecoverable damage to the entire planet:</span> call them global civilization killers. Of those, 10 will be over 10,000 meters, trillions of tons and on impact massive enough to bring our species to extinction. All these asteroids are out there, orbiting the sun... now. Nothing more needs to happen for them to go on to eventually strike Earth. As individual and discrete impact events they are all, already, events in progress. By any definition this is an existential threat. Fortunately, our current technological potential has evolved to a point that if we choose to do so we can deflect all these impact events. Given a correspondingly evolved political will, we can effectively manage this threat to the survival of our species. But since these events are aperiodic and random we can not simply trust that any enlightened political consensus will someday develop spontaneously before we are faced with responding to this reality. <span class="Underline">If we </span>would <span class="Underline">expect to deflect the next </span>impact <span class="Underline">event a deliberate, </span>rational punctuated equilibrium of our<span class="Underline"> sociopolitical will is required now. </span>The averaged relative frequency analysis described above or any derived random-chance statistical probabilistic assessment, in itself, would be strategically meaningless and irrelevant (just how many extinction level events can we afford?). However, they can be indirectly constructive in illuminating the existential and perpetual nature of the threat. Given that the most critically relevant strategic increment can be narrowly defined as the next “evergreen” 100 years, it would follow that the strategic expression of the existent risk of asteroid impact in its most likely rational postulate would be for one and only one large asteroid to be on course to strike Earth in the next 100 years... If we do eventually choose to respond to this threat, clearly there is no way we can address the dynamics or geometry of the Solar System so there is no systemic objective we can respond to here. We can not address 'The Threat of Asteroid Impact' as such. We can only respond to this threat as these objects present themselves as discrete impending impactors: one Rock at a time. This leaves us the only aspect of this threat we <em>can</em> respond to - a rationally manifest first-order and evergreen tactical definition of this threat Which unfortunately, as a product of random-chance, includes the prospect for our extinction. Asteroid impact is a randomly occurring existential condition. Therefore the next large asteroid impact event is inevitable and expectable, and that inevitable expectability begins... now. The Probability is Low: <span class="Underline">As a risk assessment: “The probability for large asteroid impact in the next century is low”... is irrelevant.</span> Say the daily random-chance probability for large asteroid impact is one in a billion. And because in any given increment of time the chance that an impact will not happen is far greater than it will, the chance that it will happen can be characterized as low. However, if we look out the window and see a large asteroid 10 seconds away from impact the daily random-chance probability for large asteroid impact will still be one in a billion... and we must therefore still characterize the chance of impact as low... When the characterization of the probability can be seen to be tested to be in contradiction with the manifest empirical fact of the assessed event it then must also then be seen to be empirically false. Worse: true only in the abstract and as such, misleading. <span class="Underline">If we are going to</span> <em><u>respond</u></em><span class="Underline"> to these events, when it counts the most, this method of assessment will not be relevant.</span> If information can be seen to be irrelevant ex post it must also be seen to be irrelevant ex ante. This assessment is meaningless. Consider the current threat of the asteroid Apophis. With its discovery we abandon the average relative frequency derived annual random-chance probability for a rational conditional-empiric probabilistic threat assessment derived from observing its speed, vector and position relative to Earth. The collective result is expressed in probabilistic terms due only to our inability to meter these characteristics accurately enough to be precise to the point of potential impact. As Apophis approaches this point the observations and resulting metrics become increasingly accurate and the conditional-empiric probability will process to resolve into a certainty of either zero or one. Whereas the random-chance probability is unaffected by whether Apophis strikes Earth or not. These two probabilistic perceptions are inherently incompatible and unique, discrete and nonconstructive to each other. The only thing these two methodologies have in common is a nomenclature: probability/likelihood/chance, which has unfortunately served only to obfuscate their semantic value making one seem rational and relevant when it can never be so. However, merely because they are non rational does not make averaged relative frequency derived random-chance probabilities worthless. They do have some psychological merit and enable some intuitive 'old lady' wisdom. When we consider the occasion of some unpredictable event that may cause us harm and there is nothing tangible we can do to deflect or forestall or stop it from happening, we still want to know just how much we should worry about it. We need to quantify chance not only in in case we can prepare or safeguard or insure against potentially recoverable consequences after the fact, but to also meter how much hope we should invest against the occasion of such events. Hope mitigates fear. And when there is nothing else we can do about it only then is it wise to mitigate fear... “The probability for large asteroid impact in the next century is low” does serve that purpose. It is a metric for hope. Fifty years ago, before we began to master space and tangibly responding this threat of asteroid impact became a real course of action, hope was all we could do. Today we can do much more. Today we can hold our hope for when the time comes to successfully deflect. And then, after we have done everything we can possibly do to deflect it, there will still be of room for hope... and good luck. Until then, <span class="Underline">when anyone says that the probability for large asteroid impact</span> or Extinction by NEO <span class="Underline">is low they are offering nothing more than a metric for hope -- not rational information constructive to</span> metering a response or <span class="Underline">making a decision</span> to do so or not. Here, the probability is in service to illusion... slight-of-mind... and is nothing more than comfort-food-for-thought. We still need such probabilistic comfort-food-for-thought for things like Rogue Black Holes and Gamma Bursts where we are still imaginably defenseless. But if we expect to punctuate the political equilibrium and develop the capability to effectively respond to the existential threat of asteroid impact, we must allow a rational and warranted fear of extinction by asteroid impact to drive a rational and warranted response to this threat forward. Forward into the hands and minds of those who have the aptitude and training and experience in <em>using</em> fear to handle fearful things. Fear focuses the mind... Fear reminds us that there are dire negative consequences if we fail. If we are going to concern ourselves with mounting a response and deflecting these objects and no longer tolerate and suffer this threat, would it not be far more relevant to know in which century the probability for large asteroid impact was <em>high</em> and far more effective to orient our thinking from when it <em>will not</em> to when it <em>will</em> occur? But<span class="Underline"> this probabilistic perspective</span> can not even pretend to approach providing us with that kind of information. As such, it <span class="Underline">can never be strategically relevant</span>: contribute to the conduct of implementing a response. The same can be said when such abstract reasoning is used to forward the notion that the next asteroid to strike Earth will likely be small... This leads us to little more than a hope based Planetary Defense. <span class="Underline">If we are ever to respond to this threat well then we must begin thinking about this threat better.Large Asteroid Impacts Are Random Events. Expect the next one to occur at any time</span>. Strategically speaking, this means being at DefCon 3: lock-cocked and ready to rock, prepared to defend the planet and mankind from the worst case scenario, 24/7/52... forever. <span class="Underline">Doing anything less</span> by design, <span class="Underline">would be like planning to bring a knife to a gunfight</span>. If we expect our technological abilities to develop and continue to shape our nascent and still politically tacit will to respond to this threat: if we are to build an effective Planetary Defense, we must abandon the debilitating sophistry of “The probability for large asteroid impact in the next century is low” in favor of rational random inevitable expectation... and its attendant fear.<br />

<em><u>Experts predict</u> that <u>solar power will become the planet's dominant energy</u> <u>source</u> during the next 50 years. This is largely driven by the world’s need to reduce greenhouse gases contributing to climate change. All countries are predicted to greatly benefit (from the changes towards harnessing more renewable energy. However, the <u>poorer countries</u> in the world <u>stand to see the greatest economic growth from the shift</u> to renewable energy This growth will be driven by the manufacturing, operation, and maintenance of many medium, small and micro-renewable energy projects in these countries analysis say. One of these experts is Earth Day co-founder Denis Hayes who spoke at a lecture at Buffalo USA University. 4Wquo;We have so much sunshine hitting the earth; said Denis Hayes every time we have doubled the production of solar panels, the cost has come down 20% and we see strong growth it we can get the production cost down to $1 a Mr John Maina from Kenya has won the Energy Globe Award from the European Parliament a prize for outstanding projects in energy efficiency. Mr <u>Maina</u> has <u>pioneered ways of increasing harvests of small farms by</u> SO% <u>using solar power</u> John Maina has <u>developed a solar energy oven which allows</u> (<u>fruit and vegetables to be dried and</u> (hereby <u>preserved. This</u> has <u>permitted higher yields</u> on (arms <u>without using</u> more water or <u>pesticides</u>. Australia - Heat Reflective Paint Used in Queensland Government Schools This commercial reflective roof coating can lower the internal heat under a roof by up to 1BC according to the supplier. This can result in considerable power savings of up to 60% in aircondiboning usage costs. The lower temperatures inside industrial and commercial buildings results in lower air conditioning power consumption and a higher level of personal comfort. The heat reflective paints are made of a co-polymer compound containing inert pigments and special filters uniquely formulated to re-radiate 90% of solar infrared and 85% of ultraviolet rays back into the atmosphere says the manufacturer. This effectively stops heat transfer through the roof. Examples of use are on the roofs of 431 Queensland schools resulting in a significant increase in comfort for students and staff as well as lower maintenance costs. The Insultec membrane coating has also been used effectively in large scale road construction projects in Saudi Arabia where extreme temperatures caused expansion and contraction gaps on concrete road surfaces. India - Mumbai Introduces Compulsory Energy Audits 'or Government Buildings and Politicians Homes The Public Works Deparlmenl in Mumbai now monitors the electricity bills of ministers and helps them bring down power consumption the Minister for Alternative Energy Vinay Kore told the Mumbai News last week. Vinay Kore said that conference halls in his department have been fitted with split air conditioners and CFL lamps and one wall has been replaced with frosted glass to let in natural light. The Public Works Minister. Chhagan Bhrybal. said that he doesn't leave tights on when nobody is at home and he only uses CFL lamps and one air conditioner at a time Legislator, Vinod Tawde, said that he arranged to switch off lights in his apartment complex and residents only use the lift sparingly. No one uses it for going down and he only leaves his air conditioner on for one hour, he said. The mayor, Or Shubha Raul said that he will be installing a solar cooker and CFL lamps and in the office he leaves the lights and air conditioner switched off. also he has installed a solar energy unit in his bungalow. Switzerland • Solar Powered Football Stadium. Swiss architect Renato Marazzi has designed the world's biggest solar power installation ever (o be incorporated into the roof ol a football stadium. The Stade de Suisse at Wankdorf will be hosbng the 2006 Football Championships. The stadium has 5.152 solar panels and generates 700.000kw hours of electricity per annum supplying energy to the nabonal power grid. This corresponds to the energy used by 260 households a year, explained Renato Marazzi speaking in Doha, Qatar where his firm Marazzi and Paul was poinbng out that Qatar enjoys more sunshine than Switzerland.

While theoretical debates at academic conferences are important to academics, the discourse and concerns of foreign-policy decision- makers are quite different, so different that they constitute a distinctive problem- solving, theory-averse, policy-making subculture. There is a danger that<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> academics assume that <strong>the</strong> discourses <strong>they engage</strong> are <strong>more</strong> significant in </span>the practice of<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> foreign policy </span>and the exercise of power<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> <strong>than they really are</strong></span>. This is not, however, to minimize <span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the</span></strong></span> obvious importance of academia as a general institutional structure among many that sustain certain epistemic communities in particular states. In general, I do not disagree with Dalby’s fourth point about politics and discourse except to note that his <span class="underline0"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">statement-‘Precisely because reality could be represented in particular ways political decisions could be taken, </span></strong></span><span class="Emphasis2"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">troops and material moved and war fought’</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">-evades the important question of agency</span>that I noted in my review essay. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The assumption that it is representations that make action possible is inadequate by itself. Political, military and economic structures, institutions, </span>discursive networks and leadership<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> are <strong>all</strong> crucial in explaining <strong>social</strong> action <strong>and should be theorized together with representational practices.</strong></span> Both here and earlier, Dalby’s reasoning inclines towards a form of idealism. In response to Dalby’s fifth point (with its three subpoints), it is worth noting, first, that his book is about the CPD, not the Reagan administration. He analyzes certain CPD discourses, root the geographical reasoning practices of the Reagan administration nor its public-policy reasoning on national security. Dalby’s book is narrowly textual; the general contextuality of the Reagan administration is not dealt with. Second, let me simply note that I find that the distinction between critical theorists and post- structuralists is a little too rigidly and heroically drawn by Dalby and others. Third, Dalby’s interpretation of the reconceptualization of national security in Moscow as heavily influenced by dissident peace researchers in Europe is highly idealist, an interpretation that ignores the structural and ideological crises facing the Soviet elite at that time. Gorbachev’s reforms and his new security discourse were also strongly self- interested, an ultimately futile attempt to save the Communist Party and a discredited regime of power from disintegration. The issues raised by Simon Dalby in his comment are important ones for all those interested in the practice of critical geopolitics. While I agree with Dalby that questions of discourse are extremely important ones for political geographers to engage<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">, there is a dangerof fetishizing this concern with discourse so that we neglect the institutional and the </span>sociological, the materialist and the cultural, the<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> political </span>and the geographical <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">contexts within which particular discursive strategies become significant. </span><br />

5. Realism is true and inevitable – a shift away collapses into chaos.<br />
Mearsheimer 1 (professor of political science at University of Chicago, <em>The Tragedy of Great Power Politics</em>, pg. 361)<br />
<u>The optimists' claim that security competition and war among the great powers has been burned out of the system is wrong.</u> In fact, <u>all of the major states around the globe still care deeply about the balance of power and are destined to compete for power among themselves for the foreseeable future</u>. Consequently, <u>realism will offer the most powerful explanations of international politics over the next century</u>, and this will be true even if the debates among academic and policy elites are dominated by non-realist theories. In short, <u>the real world remains a realist world. States still fear each other and seek to gain power at each other's expense, because international anarchy-the driving force behind greatpower behavior-did not change with the end of the Cold War, and there are few signs that such change is likely any time soon.</u> States remain the principal actors in world politics and there is still no night watchman standing above them. For sure, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused a major shift in the global distribution of power. But it did not give rise to a change in the anarchic structure of the system, and without that kind of profound change, there is no reason to expect the great powers to behave much differently in the new century than they did in previous centuries. Indeed, <u>considerable evidence from the 1990s indicates that power politics has not disappeared</u> from Europe and Northeast Asia, the regions in which there are two or more great powers, as well as possible great powers such as Germany and Japan. There is no question, however, that the competition for power over the past decade has been low-key. Still, <u>there is potential for intense security competion among the great powers that might lead to a major war.</u> Probably <u>the best evidence of that possibility is the fact that the United States maintains about one hundred thousand troops each in Europe and in Northeast Asia for the explicit purpose of keeping the major states in each region at peace.</u><br />

7. No policy failure<br />

Linguistic Relativism. One approach of postmodernists is to point to the complex nature of language and meaning as a critique of positiv¬ism; this critique is, in turn, relevant to the overwhelming amount of work in IR (Phillips 1977; Giddens 1979; George and Campbell 1990). Although a comprehensive assessment of the linguistic relativism debate is beyond the scope of this project, it is possible to address the underlying philosophical argument, which is fairly straightforward. Building on the work of Wittgenstein (1968), <u>the linguistic variant of</u> the <u>criticism contends that any attempt to reduce</u> everyday <u>terms &quot;to a singular essentialist meaning&quot; is problematic given &quot;the multiplicity of meaning</u> to be found <u>in social activity</u>&quot; (George and Campbell 1990, 273). By implication, <u>a</u> concept, term, <u>word</u>, or symbol <u>cannot correspond &quot;to some</u> ... <u>externally derived</u> foundation or <u>object</u>&quot; and ulti¬mately is context-dependent. Similarly, <u>Phillips argues that the validity of theory cannot be determined because &quot;There is no standard or objective reality</u> (always fixed, never changing) against which to com¬pare a universe of discourse ... nothing exists outside of our language and actions which can be used to justify ... a statement's truth or falsity&quot; (1977, 273). Of course, <u>it is not entirely clear how this &quot;multiplicity of meaning&quot; is sufficient to render meaningless an approach that assumes the existence of an objective reality</u>. <u>A</u>n important <u>distinction must be drawn between the assertion that these discrepancies might have a significant impact on scientific theorizing and the assertion that they do have such an effect.</u> <u>In most cases, errors of interpretation and generalization produced by linguistic nuances are relatively insignificant and ultimately have very little impact on the generalizability of social theories. There are numerous words, symbols, concepts, and ideas, for example, that are commonly understood, regardless of other linguistic variations, but the implications of this standardized concep¬tual framework are frequently overlooked and ignored in the post¬modern critique</u>. In any case, it is contingent upon the theorist to specify the precise meaning of any variable or symbol that is central to a theory. Although definitions may vary — possibly partly, but not entirely, as a conse¬quence of language — <u>scholars</u> nevertheless <u>are more likely than not to understand and agree on the underlying meaning of most words, symbols and phrases</u>. The point is that <u>theorists generally do have a common starting point and often suspend</u>, at least temporarily, <u>coun¬terproductive debates over meaning in order to shift emphasis towards the strength and logical consistency of the theory itself</u>, <u>a more important issue that has nothing to do with language</u>. Evaluating the internal consistency of the central assumptions and propositions of a theory, that is, criticising from within, is likely to be more conducive to theoretical progress than the alternative, which is to reject the idea of theory building entirely. Finally, <u>the lack of purity and precision</u>, another consequence of linguistic relativism, <u>does not necessarily imply irrelevance of purpose or approach. The study of international relations may not be exact,</u> given limitations noted by Wittgenstein and others, <u>but precision is a practical research problem, not an insurmountable barrier to progress</u>. In fact, most observers who point to the context-dependent nature of language are critical not so much of the social sciences but of the incorrect application of scientific techniques to derive overly precise measurement of weakly developed concepts. <u>Clearly, our understanding of the causes of international conflict</u> — and most notably war — <u>has improved considerably as a consequence of applying sound scientific methods and valid operationalizations</u> (Vasquez 1987, 1993). <u>The alternative</u> approach, implicit in much of the postmodern literature, <u>is to</u> fully accept the inadequacy of positivism, <u>throw one's hands up in failure</u>, given the complexity of the subject, and repudiate the entire enterprise. The most relevant question is whether we would know more or less about international relations if we pursued that strategy.<br />

<u>Religious moderation springs from the fact that even the least educated person among us simply <em>knows</em> more about certain matters than anyone did two thousand years ago</u>—and much of <u>this knowledge is incompatible with scripture</u>. Having heard something about <u>the medical discoveries of the last hundred years, most of us no longer equate disease processes with sin or demonic possession.</u> Having learned about the known distances between objects in our universe, most of us (about half of us, actually) find the idea that the whole works was created six thousand years ago (with light from distant stars already in transit toward the earth) impossible to take seriously. Such concessions to modernity do not in the least suggest that faith is compatible with reason, or that our religious traditions are in principle open to new learning: it is just that <u>the utility of ignorin</u>g (or &quot;reinterpreting&quot;) <u>certain articles of faith is now overwhelming</u>. <u>Anyone being flown to a distant city for heart-bypass surgery has conceded</u>, tacitly at least, <u>that we have learned a few things about physics, geography, engineering, and medicine since the time of Moses. So it is not that these texts have maintained their integrity over time (they haven't);</u> it is just that they have been effectively edited by our neglect of certain of their passages. Most of <u>what remains</u>— the &quot;good parts&quot;—<u>has been spared the same winnowing because we do not yet have a truly modern understanding of our ethical intuitions and our capacity for spiritual experience</u>. <u>If we better understood the workings of the human brain, we would undoubtedly discover lawful connections between our states of consciousness</u>, our modes of conduct, and the various ways we use our attention. What makes one person happier than another? Why is love more conducive to happiness than hate? Why do we generally prefer beauty to ugliness and order to chaos? Why does it feel so good to smile and laugh, and why do these shared experiences generally bring people closer together? Is the ego an illusion, and, if so, what implications does this have for human life? Is there life after death? <u>These are ultimately questions for a mature science of the mind. If we ever develop such a science,</u> most of our <u>religious texts will be no more useful to mystics than they now are to astronomers</u>.<br />

<u>Our world is fast succumbing to the activities of men and women who would stake the future of our species on beliefs that should not survive an elementary school education. That so many of us are still dying on account of ancient myths is as bewildering</u> as it is horrible, and our own attachment to these myths, whether moderate or extreme, <u>has kept us silent in the face of developments that could ultimately destroy us. Indeed, religion is as much a living spring of violence today as it was at any time in the past</u>. The recent <u>conflicts in Palestine</u> (Jews v. Muslims), the <u>Balkans</u> (Orthodox Serbians v. Catholic Croatians; Orthodox Serbians v. Bosnian and Albanian Muslims), Northern <u>Ireland</u> (Protestants v. Catholics), <u>Kashmir</u> (Muslims v. Hindus), <u>Sudan</u> (Muslims v. Christians and animists), <u>Nigeria</u> (Muslims v. Christians), <u>Ethiopia and Eritrea</u> (Muslims v.

In these places <u>religion has been the explicit cause of literally millions of deaths</u> in the last ten years. These events should strike us like psychological experiments run amok, for that is what they are. <u>Give people divergent, irreconcilable, and untestable notions about what happens after death, and then oblige them to live together with limited resources</u>. <u>The result is just what we see: an unending cycle of murder and cease-fire</u>. If <u>history reveals any categorical truth, it is that an insufficient taste for evidence regularly brings out the worst in us. Add weapons of mass destruction to this diabolical clockwork, and you have found a recipe for the fall of civilization.What can be said of the nuclear brinkmanship between India and Pakistan</u> if their divergent religious beliefs are to be &quot;respected&quot;? There is nothing for religious pluralists to criticize but each country's poor diplomacy—while, in truth, the entire conflict is born of an irrational embrace of myth. Over one million people died in the orgy of religious killing that attended the partitioning of India and Pakistan. <u>The two countries have since fought three official wars, suffered a continuous bloodletting at their shared border, and are now poised to exterminate one another with nuclear weapons simply because they disagree about &quot;facts&quot; that are every bit as fanciful as the names of Santa's reindeer</u>. <u>And their discourse is such that they are capable of mustering a suicidal level of enthusiasm for these subjects without evidence</u>. Their conflict is only nominally about land, because their incompatible claims upon the territory of Kashmir are a direct consequence of their religious differences. Indeed, the only reason India and Pakistan are different countries is that the beliefs of Islam cannot be reconciled with those of Hinduism. From the point of view of Islam, it would be scarcely possible to conceive a way of scandalizing Allah that is not perpetrated, each morning, by some observant Hindu. The &quot;land&quot; these people are actually fighting over is not to be found in this world. <u>When will we realize that the concessions we have made to faith in our political discourse have prevented us from even speaking about, much less uprooting, the most prolific source of violence in our history?</u><br />

GRAY 1999 (D.M., “Space as a frontier - the role of human motivation,” Space Policy, August)<br />
<u>Frontiers have the reputation for generating a ‘Frontier Mentality’</u>. This is generally thought of in terms of the American frontier mythos. The sturdy pioneer is seen as independent, self-sufficient, and highly motivated to provide a better life for his family. He is also portrayed as <u>having little regard for</u> any <u>environmental devastation or</u> for any <u>indigenous society</u> he might encounter. <u>While there were no doubt pioneers with these qualities, these values reflect the unique mixing of the historic society and the realities of the resources being utilized on the frontier at that time. Further, our perception of the past is distorted by the ethics of our society and the historic, social and entertainment mediums by which the picture of the past is presented. If historic frontiers are studied in some detail, it soon becomes apparent that each has a unique set of values, ideals and mind-sets</u>.<br />

<em>There is already considerable concern and cooperative activity, but it must also cope with predominately structural obstacles. Beyond the practical problem of coping with existing structures, or changing them, is the deeper problem of assuming foundational points of reference for any given structural reality such that challenging or changing it is difficult or impossible. So there is an intellectual, or attitudinal, hurdle to leap at the outset – we’d have to accept that some deeply held assumptions are simply not viable (sustainable), and learn to let them go. I have suggested elsewhere that while <span style="color: black;">‘perspectives on politics in the absence of immutable external foundations may be quite widely accepted…</span><u><span style="color: black;"> there is a great temptation in public discourses to deal with uncertainty by positing certainties, and to play fundamentalist trump cards of different kinds’</span></u><span style="color: black;">(Dyer, 2008). Switching from one foundational reference to another is not likely to work, and the anti-foundational perspective taken here suggestsa pragmatic approach to developing the most effective social practices as we learn them, and adjusting structures to support them.</span> An institutional context illustrates the discourse, in so far as ‘some controversial principles, such as whether to approach from an anthropocentric perspective or from a biocentric approach, or whether the viewpoint was from the individual or community, were the focus of considerable debate’. <span style="color: black;">N</span>ot surprisingly, there is an air of realism about the application of ethical principles on renewable energy: ‘although a normative declaration would be nice, it was not feasible in the current political environment’ <span style="color: black;">(UNESCO 2007; 7). </span>The pragmatism is, nevertheless, appropriate since there is no progress to be made by assuming that an appreciation of the moral significance of energy and climate security only bears on abstractions – the point is that the underlying values reflected in political agendas should be flushed out, and the most appropriate values promoted and acted upon in a pragmatic fashion as interests. For example, it was noted that ‘barriers to renewable energy systems were institutional, political, technical and financial’ and also that there is ‘potential conflict between bioregional, potentially unstable energy systems and countries’ desires for energy independence and self-reliance’; this suggests the need for a ‘global eco-ethics’ (UNESCO 2007; 8). Pragmatism is inherent in thinking through the moral significance of such challenges: ‘From the ethical point of view, nuclear power presented many problems at each point of the complex supply chain, including uranium mining, enrichment, and risk management in a functioning plant. It was a highly centralized and state-controlled source of energy that did not promote participatory democracy’. It can also be seen that ‘nuclear and fossil-fuel based power also triggered international conflicts’. By contrast, ‘renewable energies such as solar, wind, small hydro, biomass, geothermal and tidal energy are often decentralized and can be used in remote areas without a solid energy supply system’ (UNESCO 2007; 8-9). The moral significance of <u>energy security and climate security dilemmas</u> is that they <u>cause us to see change as a challenge, rather than impossible; a challenge to be met by reconsidering our value-orientations</u> – which changes everything. Elsewhere I’ve noted that goals which the state purports to serve (health, wealth, security) are seen differently in an environmental light, and this could lead to substantial change in political practices (Dyer, 2007). Another pragmatist, John Dewey, ‘argued that the public interest was to be continuously constructed through the process of free, cooperative inquiry into the shared good of the democratic community’ and Minteer suggests that this is a necessary approach ‘in making connections between normative arguments and environmental policy discourse’ (Minteer, 2005). This reflects Hayward’s argument that environmental values are supported by enlightened human interests, and furthermore this link must exist to promote ecological goods, and that consequently there are serious implications in fully integrating environmental issues into our disciplinary concerns (Hayward, 1998). I’ve argued before that <u>environmental politics dislodges conventional understandings of moral and political agency, and in ‘this wider socio-political-economic context,</u></em> <u>ecological <em>significance may be the determining factor in the end’</em></u> <em>(Dyer, 2007). Hargrove (1989) makes an argument for anthropocentric, aesthetic sources of modern environmental concern by identifying attitudes that constrained (‘idealism’, ‘property rights’) and supported (scientific and aesthetic ideals) our environmental perspectives. If this argument doesn’t stretch us much beyond ourselves, there is no reason these anthropocentric orientations couldn’t be built upon as a foundation for more specifically ecocentric perspectives. <u>The key here is to identify the underlying ‘security’ assumptions which thwart efforts to cope with energy and climate issues coherently and effectively, and to advocate those assumptions that serve genuine long-term human security interests</u> (inevitably, in an ecological context). In this way can we take stock of the existing structures that constrain and diminish human agency – while conceiving of those that would liberate and secure it in sustainable ways. As the reality of the situation slowly dawns on us, various moral, political, economic and social actors are beginning to consider and test new strategies for coping – the real question is whether they are just playing to beat the clock, or if they’ve stopped long enough to reconsider the rules and purposes of the strategic context in which they act. 'Security' as cause and effect of a moral turn Security is central to understandings of the responsibilities of states, even definitional in their self-conception as defenders of the nation, with moral obligations to their own population which include defending them from external threats of all kinds (even if threats to nationals commonly emanate from their own state, per Booth’s ‘protection racket’, 1995). <u>Security is</u> usually <u>the first concern of individuals</u> as well, even extending to protective self-sacrifice (if sometimes greed or pleasure usurps this priority). <u>The boundaries of concern</u> and felt responsibility for security <u>are</u> nevertheless potentially <u>flexible, and moral obligations may vary over time and space</u>(who’s included, who’s not; when, where). The rationale for those obligations may now be extending over wider ranges of time and space, especially within an ecological perspective on how ‘security’ might be obtained. In this way, <u>alertness to the security implications of climate and energy drives moral development, while at the same time a developed sense of moral obligation prompts a recasting of these issues in more urgent security terms.</u></em><br />

<em>9. Realism is true and inevitable – a shift away collapses into chaos.</em><br />
<em>Mearsheimer 1 (professor of political science at University of Chicago,</em> The Tragedy of Great Power Politics<em>, pg. 361)</em><br />
<em><u>The optimists' claim that security competition and war among the great powers has been burned out of the system is wrong.</u> In fact, <u>all of the major states around the globe still care deeply about the balance of power and are destined to compete for power among themselves for the foreseeable future</u>. Consequently, <u>realism will offer the most powerful explanations of international politics over the next century</u>, and this will be true even if the debates among academic and policy elites are dominated by non-realist theories. In short, <u>the real world remains a realist world. States still fear each other and seek to gain power at each other's expense, because international anarchy-the driving force behind greatpower behavior-did not change with the end of the Cold War, and there are few signs that such change is likely any time soon.</u> States remain the principal actors in world politics and there is still no night watchman standing above them. For sure, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused a major shift in the global distribution of power. But it did not give rise to a change in the anarchic structure of the system, and without that kind of profound change, there is no reason to expect the great powers to behave much differently in the new century than they did in previous centuries. Indeed, <u>considerable evidence from the 1990s indicates that power politics has not disappeared</u> from Europe and Northeast Asia, the regions in which there are two or more great powers, as well as possible great powers such as Germany and Japan. There is no question, however, that the competition for power over the past decade has been low-key. Still, <u>there is potential for intense security competion among the great powers that might lead to a major war.</u> Probably <u>the best evidence of that possibility is the fact that the United States maintains about one hundred thousand troops each in Europe and in Northeast Asia for the explicit purpose of keeping the major states in each region at peace.</u></em><br />

<em>10. Space frontierism trades off with colonialism and war.</em><br />
<em>GRAY 1999 (D.M., “Space as a frontier - the role of human motivation,” Space Policy, August)</em><br />
<em><u>The motivation of nations to expand their spheres of influence has historically been expressed in terms of imperialism, colonialism, hegemony and outright military conquest. In America in the 19th century it was most often expressed in terms of Manifest Destiny</u> - the belief <span class="Underline">that the United States of America should extend across the continent from the Atlantic to Pacific. The movement was personified by folk heroes such a Daniel Boone, Kit Carson and Davy Crockett. However, on a larger scale it was expressed in a generationally driven agrarian and mining expansion from east to west until the Civil War and then a rebound back to the east into the interior from the Pacific in the post-War eras. In the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, the idea of a steadystate society was anathema to national prestige. Nations competed in a global land-rush with little regard for the indigenous societies. The American frontiersmen perceived the land to be empty and brushed away the native populations who could not compete with the technology, organizational structures and aggressive ideologies of the EuroAmerican society. Indeed, national ambition expressed in the expansion of physical borders continues to produce war and the threat of war. However, nationalistic expansion is given a more constructive venue when it is presented with a true wilderness in which it can grow. In the 20th century, physical frontiers were replaced by technological frontiers that provided arenas of expansionist opportunity with no native populations. The Wright Brothers, Henry Ford, Einstein, Yager, Glenn, Jobs and Gates became the new American folk heroes. They personified the expansion of the frontiers of technology and science. Instead of subjugating or pushing peoples aside, these technological frontiers tended to empower and provide new freedoms. The common man learned to put aside old ways of doing things and embrace new technologies. In 20th century America, the ideology of `Manifest Destiny’ came to be replaced with &amp;You can't stand in the way of progress!'. Nationalistic goals motivated President Kennedy to declare during a speech at Rice University on September 12, 1962, &amp;I believe this nation should commit itself, before this decade is out, to landing a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth'. The speech resulted in the spear thrust of Apollo that proved the USA's superiority over the Soviet technological machine. On Sunday, 20 July 1969, America's sphere of influence extended to the lunar surface as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted the American flag on the Sea of Tranquillity. Having proved its superiority, America could be magnanimous in victory with the symbolic handshake of Apollo}Soyuz. Since America's retreat from the successes of Apollo, nationalistic interests in space have become less clear. The USA began to quietly concentrate on orbiting satellites. Military and security organizations in the government viewed space as the most practical means of providing information they deemed necessary to maintain national security. The USA's new symbol of superiority in space became the Space Shuttle which could take larger crews to space in airline-like comfort. The USA's expansionist policies had once again moved from the physical to the technological. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the USA had little reason to compete in space. Instead, it found more prestige in allowing other countries to participate in Shuttle missions and most recently in the International Space Station. For America's partners, participation in the station provided access to space without having to develop the means to travel there. For these nations, their space programs have become a focus of national pride. For example when SPAR of Canada recently sold its space robotics unit that manufactured the Shuttle's robot arm to a subsidiary of the American company Orbital Sciences, the SPAR stock holders arose to remove the board of directors that had made the decision [2].</span></em><br />

<em>12. No policy failure</em><br />

<em>Linguistic Relativism. One approach of postmodernists is to point to the complex nature of language and meaning as a critique of positiv¬ism; this critique is, in turn, relevant to the overwhelming amount of work in IR (Phillips 1977; Giddens 1979; George and Campbell 1990). Although a comprehensive assessment of the linguistic relativism debate is beyond the scope of this project, it is possible to address the underlying philosophical argument, which is fairly straightforward. Building on the work of Wittgenstein (1968), <u>the linguistic variant of</u> the <u>criticism contends that any attempt to reduce</u> everyday <u>terms &quot;to a singular essentialist meaning&quot; is problematic given &quot;the multiplicity of meaning</u> to be found <u>in social activity</u>&quot; (George and Campbell 1990, 273). By implication, <u>a</u> concept, term, <u>word</u>, or symbol <u>cannot correspond &quot;to some</u> ... <u>externally derived</u> foundation or <u>object</u>&quot; and ulti¬mately is context-dependent. Similarly, <u>Phillips argues that the validity of theory cannot be determined because &quot;There is no standard or objective reality</u> (always fixed, never changing) against which to com¬pare a universe of discourse ... nothing exists outside of our language and actions which can be used to justify ... a statement's truth or falsity&quot; (1977, 273). Of course, <u>it is not entirely clear how this &quot;multiplicity of meaning&quot; is sufficient to render meaningless an approach that assumes the existence of an objective reality</u>. <u>A</u>n important <u>distinction must be drawn between the assertion that these discrepancies might have a significant impact on scientific theorizing and the assertion that they do have such an effect.</u> <u>In most cases, errors of interpretation and generalization produced by linguistic nuances are relatively insignificant and ultimately have very little impact on the generalizability of social theories. There are numerous words, symbols, concepts, and ideas, for example, that are commonly understood, regardless of other linguistic variations, but the implications of this standardized concep¬tual framework are frequently overlooked and ignored in the post¬modern critique</u>. In any case, it is contingent upon the theorist to specify the precise meaning of any variable or symbol that is central to a theory. Although definitions may vary — possibly partly, but not entirely, as a conse¬quence of language — <u>scholars</u> nevertheless <u>are more likely than not to understand and agree on the underlying meaning of most words, symbols and phrases</u>. The point is that <u>theorists generally do have a common starting point and often suspend</u>, at least temporarily, <u>coun¬terproductive debates over meaning in order to shift emphasis towards the strength and logical consistency of the theory itself</u>, <u>a more important issue that has nothing to do with language</u>. Evaluating the internal consistency of the central assumptions and propositions of a theory, that is, criticising from within, is likely to be more conducive to theoretical progress than the alternative, which is to reject the idea of theory building entirely. Finally, <u>the lack of purity and precision</u>, another consequence of linguistic relativism, <u>does not necessarily imply irrelevance of purpose or approach. The study of international relations may not be exact,</u> given limitations noted by Wittgenstein and others, <u>but precision is a practical research problem, not an insurmountable barrier to progress</u>. In fact, most observers who point to the context-dependent nature of language are critical not so much of the social sciences but of the incorrect application of scientific techniques to derive overly precise measurement of weakly developed concepts. <u>Clearly, our understanding of the causes of international conflict</u> — and most notably war — <u>has improved considerably as a consequence of applying sound scientific methods and valid operationalizations</u> (Vasquez 1987, 1993). <u>The alternative</u> approach, implicit in much of the postmodern literature, <u>is to</u> fully accept the inadequacy of positivism, <u>throw one's hands up in failure</u>, given the complexity of the subject, and repudiate the entire enterprise. The most relevant question is whether we would know more or less about international relations if we pursued that strategy.</em><br />

<em><u>Religious moderation springs from the fact that even the least educated person among us simply</u></em> <u>knows <em>more about certain matters than anyone did two thousand years ago</em></u><em>—and much of <u>this knowledge is incompatible with scripture</u>. Having heard something about <u>the medical discoveries of the last hundred years, most of us no longer equate disease processes with sin or demonic possession.</u> Having learned about the known distances between objects in our universe, most of us (about half of us, actually) find the idea that the whole works was created six thousand years ago (with light from distant stars already in transit toward the earth) impossible to take seriously. Such concessions to modernity do not in the least suggest that faith is compatible with reason, or that our religious traditions are in principle open to new learning: it is just that <u>the utility of ignorin</u>g (or &quot;reinterpreting&quot;) <u>certain articles of faith is now overwhelming</u>. <u>Anyone being flown to a distant city for heart-bypass surgery has conceded</u>, tacitly at least, <u>that we have learned a few things about physics, geography, engineering, and medicine since the time of Moses. So it is not that these texts have maintained their integrity over time (they haven't);</u> it is just that they have been effectively edited by our neglect of certain of their passages. Most of <u>what remains</u>— the &quot;good parts&quot;—<u>has been spared the same winnowing because we do not yet have a truly modern understanding of our ethical intuitions and our capacity for spiritual experience</u>. <u>If we better understood the workings of the human brain, we would undoubtedly discover lawful connections between our states of consciousness</u>, our modes of conduct, and the various ways we use our attention. What makes one person happier than another? Why is love more conducive to happiness than hate? Why do we generally prefer beauty to ugliness and order to chaos? Why does it feel so good to smile and laugh, and why do these shared experiences generally bring people closer together? Is the ego an illusion, and, if so, what implications does this have for human life? Is there life after death? <u>These are ultimately questions for a mature science of the mind. If we ever develop such a science,</u> most of our <u>religious texts will be no more useful to mystics than they now are to astronomers</u>.</em><br />

<u>Our world is fast succumbing to the activities of men and women who would stake the future of our species on beliefs that should not survive an elementary school education. That so many of us are still dying on account of ancient myths is as bewildering</u> as it is horrible, and our own attachment to these myths, whether moderate or extreme, <u>has kept us silent in the face of developments that could ultimately destroy us. Indeed, religion is as much a living spring of violence today as it was at any time in the past</u>. The recent <u>conflicts in Palestine</u> (Jews v. Muslims), the <u>Balkans</u> (Orthodox Serbians v. Catholic Croatians; Orthodox Serbians v. Bosnian and Albanian Muslims), Northern <u>Ireland</u> (Protestants v. Catholics), <u>Kashmir</u> (Muslims v. Hindus), <u>Sudan</u> (Muslims v. Christians and animists), <u>Nigeria</u> (Muslims v. Christians), <u>Ethiopia and Eritrea</u> (Muslims v.

Chechen Muslims; Muslim Azerbaijanis v. Catholic and Orthodox Armenians) <u>are merely a few cases in point</u>. In these places <u>religion has been the explicit cause of literally millions of deaths</u> in the last ten years. These events should strike us like psychological experiments run amok, for that is what they are. <u>Give people divergent, irreconcilable, and untestable notions about what happens after death, and then oblige them to live together with limited resources</u>. <u>The result is just what we see: an unending cycle of murder and cease-fire</u>. If <u>history reveals any categorical truth, it is that an insufficient taste for evidence regularly brings out the worst in us. Add weapons of mass destruction to this diabolical clockwork, and you have found a recipe for the fall of civilization.What can be said of the nuclear brinkmanship between India and Pakistan</u> if their divergent religious beliefs are to be &quot;respected&quot;? There is nothing for religious pluralists to criticize but each country's poor diplomacy—while, in truth, the entire conflict is born of an irrational embrace of myth. Over one million people died in the orgy of religious killing that attended the partitioning of India and Pakistan. <u>The two countries have since fought three official wars, suffered a continuous bloodletting at their shared border, and are now poised to exterminate one another with nuclear weapons simply because they disagree about &quot;facts&quot; that are every bit as fanciful as the names of Santa's reindeer</u>. <u>And their discourse is such that they are capable of mustering a suicidal level of enthusiasm for these subjects without evidence</u>. Their conflict is only nominally about land, because their incompatible claims upon the territory of Kashmir are a direct consequence of their religious differences. Indeed, the only reason India and Pakistan are different countries is that the beliefs of Islam cannot be reconciled with those of Hinduism. From the point of view of Islam, it would be scarcely possible to conceive a way of scandalizing Allah that is not perpetrated, each morning, by some observant Hindu. The &quot;land&quot; these people are actually fighting over is not to be found in this world. <u>When will we realize that the concessions we have made to faith in our political discourse have prevented us from even speaking about, much less uprooting, the most prolific source of violence in our history?</u><br />

Global modern day capitalism, in its most destructive phase, is made out of a ‘substance’ that cannot overcome itself to produce wealth through its centralization, as far as it has gone now. But it is possible, if many ‘planets’ ‘stars’ or everything that makes up a wealthy locality all evolve to revolve around a central core, then this will produce a kind of ‘active centralization’ where the dead and cold rock of debt is stripped apart of its structure and is made into pure wealth, pure value and then jetted out of the core of civilization, thereby producing wealth on a higher niche via fusing the negative debt with the unseen gravity of its social environment. Evolution is at a somewhat constant rate and afflicts every gene and meme in existence at varying energies, if we don’t adapt to our environment then we will be at the mercy of the ourselves alone, likewise if we don’t adapt ourselves we will be at the mercy of our environment alone. Although good for some, for the future it is severely disabling and cannot allow for space exploration. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Capitalism,</span> like every theory, is memes, therefore it can be improved by alternating the frequencies and wavelengths of its usage, it <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">can be evolved to be more collective</span>, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">to refertilize</span> the environment so that individuals can once again contribute back into the centralization <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">instead of a</span> ‘once in a civilization <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">opportunity’ where we have one big boom and the rest is dumped</span> in the toilet for <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the peasants to feast.</span> Like these active galaxies, absorb that which gets too centralized and jet it out as high energy wealth across the void of space, this jet then crushes the inert clouds, or communities, around it into fusing stars of their own. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Modern capitalism needs a black hole at its centre</span>, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">therefore the individuals</span> at the core of its centrifuge will be spaghetified and <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">will have their </span>organizations and <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">corporations torn apart into </span>sub atomic <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">values that then are then fused into </span>exotic <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">wealth able to drive civilization into space and into creating new homes on distant planets for our species. </span> The centralization, combined with its spin, acts as a funnel to the higher castes of society that are then able to create beyond themselves enough that we can produce strong civilizations, culture, technology and mechanization. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">So remember</span> <em><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">you shit eating socialists,</span></strong></em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater or</span> your <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">people will not have a</span>n intelligent <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">future at all, regressing into</span> your <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">economic swamps is not a viable solution</span>.<br />

<em><span style="color: black;"> “<u>The development of capitalism</u>,” writes deep ecologist and wilderness educator Dolores LaChapelle, “<u>consists in making a group of people addicted to some ‘substance’ and selling it to them</u>” (48). She cites as evidence the <u>age of exploration</u> roughly <u>beginning with Columbus and</u> describes the <u>development of addictions to gold, silver, sugar, tobacco and opium,</u> among others (40). <u>This</u> “substance approach to reality” (49) <u>made modern capitalism possible</u>. <u>By compartmentalizing the natural, material world, Europeans turned the earth into a pile of “natural resources,” commodities which existed for human exploitation, consumption, and now, addiction.</u> One of LaChapelle’s historical observations still can be observed today: Europeans turned the Indian’s sacred tobacco into just another substance--unrelated to anything else. And then produced it on plantations and sold it to a world, gradually growing more addicted to it--until now it’s one of the leading causes of death. Formerly tobacco was life-enhancing, because smoking the ceremonial pipe strengthened the relationships among 10all the humans present as well as put humans into relationship with “powers” of the sky and of the earth (49<u>). A disturbingly similar phenomenon has occurred with modern energy use.</u> In many long- lived hunter-gatherer cultures, communal fires are the source of energy: they were used to prepare food and warm and protect families or entire tribes. Moreover, they were objects of veneration and centers of ritual (Fiero 3); the energy of the fire was one expression of the energy of the universe. Thomas Berry observes that “awareness of an all-pervading mysterious energy articulated in the infinite variety of natural phenomenon seems to be the primordial experience of human consciousness, awakening to an awesome universe filled with mysterious power” (24). But <u>capitalism commodified that energy, bundled it and sold it by the gallon and the kilowatt-hour, and thus denied energy its “life-enhancing” powers.</u> In a supreme irony, <u>capitalists stripped energy of its most vital value when they placed a price on it.</u> <u>Most of us could hardly say we utilize an “all-prevading mysterious energy” when we switch on the blender or “[awaken] to an awesome universe filled with mysterious power” when we make our morning commute.</u> <u>There can exist no “all-pervading” commodity, no strictly utilitarian essence. When we view the energy that we purchase at the gas station or through our electric bill as a</u> </span></em><u>substance<em>--a tool of technological utility--not an essence</em></u><em>, as Berry describes, <u>we become addicted.</u></em><br />

The wider question is, what role does the world capitalist system play in the war system? When examining particular wars, the immediate role of profit and accumulation are often minimal. Examples are World War Two, the Indochinese War and the many Middle East wars. Even in many colonial empires, immediate economic advantages for the capitalist class have played a minor role compared to issues of expansion and maintenance of state power. The role of capitalism mainly entered through its structuring of economic relations which are supervised separately and jointly by capitalist states. The main military service of the state to capitalists in the international system is to oppose movements which threaten the viability of capitalist economic relations. This includes state socialism and all movements for self-management. At the same time, the way this state intervention operates, namely through separate and potentially competing state apparatuses, can conflict with the security of capitalism. Wars and military expenditures can hurt national economies, as in the case of US government expenditures for fighting in Vietnam. Only some struggles against capitalism have potential for challenging the war system. Efforts to oppose capital by mobilising the power of the state do little in this direction. In particular, promotion of state socialism (the destruction of capitalism within a state mode, with the maintenance of bureaucratic control and military power) does little to address the problem of war. The trouble here is that much of the socialist left sees capitalism as the sole source of evil in the world. This approach is blind to the roots of social problems that do not primarily grow out of class domination, including racism, sexism, environmental degradation and war. Because of this blindness, even the struggle against capitalism is weakened, since attention is not paid to systems of power such as patriarchy and bureaucracy which are mobilised to support capitalism as well as other interests.</span></strong></em><br />

<em><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Does capitalism cause more wars?

<em><strong>A refusal to engage politically will further the right- risks extinction. Reformism is necessary</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>To many readers, such questions probably sound familiar. <u>Efforts to rid the world of war, poverty, human rights abuses and injustice in general are perennial challenges that require heightened compassion and a commitment that transcends one’s time on earth. The questions are especially relevant, however, to environmentalists.</u> They represent the kind of challenges we constantly pose to ourselves and to those we try to convince to join us. <u>Environmental issues are some of the gravest dangers facing humanity and all life on the planet. At their most immediate, environmental problems undermine the quality of life for the poorest and are increasingly eroding the quality of life of even the affluent.</u> At the extreme, e<u>nvironmental challenges threaten to fracture the fundamental organic infrastructure that supports life on Earth and thus imperil life’s very survival. What to do?</u> Environmental Studies is the academic discipline charged with trying to figure this out. Like Feminist and Race Studies, it emerged out of a political movement and thus never understood itself as value-neutral. Coming on the heels of the modern environmental movement of the 1960s, environmental studies has directed itself toward understanding the biophysical limits of the earth and how humans can live sustainably given those limits. As such, it has always seen its normative commitments not as biases that muddy its inquiry but as disciplining directives that focus scholarship in scientifically and politically relevant directions. To be sure, the discipline’s natural scientists see themselves as objective observers of the natural world and understand their work as normative only to the degree that it is shaped by the hope of helping to solve environmental problems. Most otherwise remain detached from the political conditions in which their work is assessed. The discipline’s social scientists also maintain a stance of objectivity to the degree that they respect the facts of the social world, but many of them engage the political world by offering policy prescriptions and new political visions. What is it like to research and teach Environmental Studies these days? Where does the normative dimension of the discipline fall into contemporary political affairs? Specifically<u>, how should social thinkers within Environmental Studies understand the application of their normative commitments? Robert Cox once distinguished what he calls “problem-solving” theory from “critical theory.” The former, which aims toward social and political reform, accepts prevailing power relationships and institutions and implicitly uses these as a framework for inquiry and action. As a theoretical enterprise, problem-solving theory works within current paradigms to address particular intellectual and practical challenges. Critical theory, in contrast, questions existing power dynamics and seeks not only to reform but to transform social and political conditions.1 Critical environmental theory has come under attack in recent years</u>. As the discipline has matured and further cross-pollinated with other fields, some of us have become enamored with continental philosophy, cultural and communication studies, high-level anthropological and sociological theory and a host of other insightful disciplines that tend to step back from contemporary events and paradigms of thought and reveal structures of power that reproduce social and political life. <u>While such engagement has refined our ability to identify and make visible impediments to creating a greener world, it has also isolated critical Environmental Studies from the broader discipline and, seemingly, the actual world it is trying to transform. Indeed, critical environmental theory has become almost a sub-discipline to itself. It has developed a rarefied language and, increasingly, an insular audience. To many, this has rendered critical theory not more but less politically engaged as it scales the heights of thought only to be further distanced from practice. It</u> increasingly <u>seems</u>, to many, <u>to be an impotent discourse preaching radical ideas to an already initiated choir.</u> Critical Environmental Studies is also sounding ºat these days coming off the heels of, arguably, the most anti-environmentalist decade ever. <u>The Bush Administration’s tenure has been an all-time low for environmental protection.</u> The Administration has installed industry-friendly administrators throughout the executive branch, rolled back decades of domestic environmental law and international environmental leadership, politicized scientific evidence and expressed outright hostility to almost any form of environmental regulation.2 1. Cox 1996. 2. Gore 2007; and Pope and Rauber 2006. <u>With the US as the global hegemon, it is hard to overestimate the impact these actions have had on world environmental affairs.</u> Being a politically engaged environmental scholar has been difficult during the past several years. I<u>n the US, instead of being proactive, the environmental community has adopted a type of rearguard politics in which it has tried simply to hold the line against assaults</u> on everything from the Endangered Species Act, New Source Review and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the Kyoto Protocol and international cooperative efforts to curb deforestation and loss of biological diversity. <u>Outside the US, the environmental community has had to struggle for pronounced relevance in similar issues as it has operated in the shadow of an environmentally-irresponsible hegemon. Much of the academic world has followed suit, as it were. In the US, it has found itself needing to argue for basics like the knowledge of environmental science, the wisdom of enforcing established law, the importance of holding violators accountable and the significance of the US to remain engaged in international environmental affairs.</u> Outside the US, the academic community has fared only marginally better. For instance, <u>many in Europe, who have long advanced analyses of the formation and implementation of regimes, found themselves backpedaling as they wrestled with the significance of international regimes absent hegemonic participation. The result is that the space for what was considered politically-relevant scholarship has shrunk dramatically; what used to be considered problemsolving theory has become so out of touch with political possibility that it has been relegated to the margins of contemporary thought.</u> Put differently, the realm of critical theory has grown tremendously as hitherto reasonable ideas have increasingly appeared radical and previously radical ones have been pushed even further to the hinterlands of critical thought. <u>As we enter the final stretch of the Bush Administration and the waning years of the millennium’s first decade, the political landscape appears to be changing. In the US, a Democratic Congress, environmental action at the municipal and state levels, and a growing sense that a green foreign policy may be a way to weaken global terrorism, enhance US energy independence and reestablish US moral leadership in the world, have partially resuscitated and reenergized environmental concern.</u>3 Worldwide, there seems to be a similar and even more profound shift as people in all walks of life are recognizing the ecological, social and economic effects of climate change, corporations are realizing that environmental action can make business sense, and environmental values in general are permeating even some of the most stubborn societies. The “perfect storm” of this combination is beginning to put environmental issues ªrmly on the world’s radar screen. It seems that a new day is arising for environmentalism and, by extension, Environmental Studies. What role should environmental scholarship assume in this new climate? Specifically, how wise is it to pursue critical Environmental Studies at such an opportune moment? <u>Is it strategically useful to study the outer reaches of environmental thought and continue to reflect on the structural dimensions of environmental degradation when the political tide seems to be turning and problem-solving theorists may once again have the ear of those in power?</u> Is now the time to run to the renewed, apparently meaningful center or to cultivate more incisive critical environmental thought? <u>Notwithstanding the promise of the new environmental moment for asking fundamental questions, many may counsel caution toward critical Environmental Studies. The political landscape may be changing but it is unclear if critical Environmental Studies is prepared to make itself relevant. Years of being distant from political influence has intensified the insularity and arcane character of critical environmental theory, leaving the discipline rusty in its ability to make friends within policy circles. Additionally, over the past few years, the public has grown less open to radical environmental ideas</u>, as it has been fed a steady diet of questioning even the basics of environmental issues. Indeed, that the Bush Administration enjoyed years of bulldozing over environmental concern without loud, sustained, vocal opposition should give us pause. It suggests that <u>we should not expect too much, too soon. The world is still ensconced in an age of global terror; the “high” politics of national security and economic productivity continue to over-shadow environmental issues; and the public needs to be slowly seasoned to the insights and arguments of critical theory before it can appreciate their importance</u>—as if it has been in the dark for years and will be temporary blinded if thrown into the daylight too soon. From this perspective, so the logic might go<u>, scholars should restrict themselves to problemsolving theory and direct their work toward the mainstream of environmental thought.</u> Such prudence makes sense. However, we should remember that problemsolving theory, by working within existing paradigms, at best simply smoothes bumps in the road in the reproduction of social practices. It solves certain dilemmas of contemporary life but is unable to address the structural factors that reproduce broad, intractable challenges. Problem-solving theory, to put it differently, gets at the symptoms of environmental harm rather than the root causes. As such, it might slow the pace of environmental degradation but doesn’t steer us in fundamentally new, more promising directions. No matter how politically sensitive one wants to be, such new direction is precisely what the world needs. The last few years have been lost time, in terms of fashioning a meaningful, global environmental agenda. Nonetheless, we shouldn’t kid ourselves that we were in some kind of green nirvana before the Bush Administration took power and before the world of terror politics trumped all other policy initiatives. The world has faced severe environmental challenges for decades and, while it may seem a ripe time to reinvigorate problem-solving theory in the new political climate, we must recognize that all the problem-solving theory of the world won’t get us out of the predicament we’ve been building for years. We are all familiar with the litany of environmental woes. Scientists tell us, for example, that we are now in the midst of the sixth great extinction since life formed on the planet close to a billion years ago. If things don’t change, we will drive one-third to one-half of all species to extinction over the next 50 years.4 Despite this, there are no policy proposals being advanced at the national or international levels that come even close to addressing the magnitude of biodiversity loss.5 Likewise, we know that the build-up of greenhouse gases is radically changing the climate, with catastrophic dangers beginning to express themselves and greater ones waiting in the wings. The international community has embarked on signiªcant efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions but no policies are being debated that come even close to promising climate stabilization—including commitments to reduce the amount of carbon emissions per unit of GDP, as advanced by the US government, and to reduce GHG emissions globally by 5 percent below 1990 levels, as specified by the Kyoto Protocol. Scientists tell us that, to really make a difference, we need reductions on the order of 70–80 percent below 1990 levels.6 Such disconnects between high-level policy discussions and the state of the environment are legion. Whether one looks at data on ocean fisheries, fresh water scarcity or any other major environmental dilemma, the news is certainly bad as our most aggressive policies fall short of the minimum required. What is our role as scholars in the face of such a predicament? Many of us can and should focus on problem-solving theory. We need to figure out, for example, the mechanisms of cap and trade, the tightening of rules against trafficking in endangered species and the ratcheting up of regulations surrounding issues such as water distribution. <u>We should, in other words, keep our noses to the grindstone and work out incremental routes forward. This is important not simply because we desperately need policy-level insight and want our work to be taken seriously but also because it speaks to those who are tone-deaf to more radical orientations. Most of the public in the developed world apparently doesn’t like to reflect on the deep structures of environmental affairs and certainly doesn’t like thought that recommends dramatically changing our lifestyles. Nonetheless, given the straits that we are in, a different appreciation for relevance and radical thought is due—especially one that takes seriously the normative bedrock of our discipline.</u> Critical theory self-consciously eschews value-neutrality and, in doing so, is able to ask critical questions about the direction of current policies and orientations. If there ever were a need for critical environmental theory, it is now— when a thaw in political stubbornness is seemingly upon us and the stakes of avoiding dramatic action are so grave. <u>The challenge is to fashion a more strategic and meaningful type of critical theory. We need to find ways of speaking that re-shift the boundary between reformist and radical ideas or, put differently, render radical insights in a language that makes clear what they really are, namely, the most realistic orientations these days.</u> 4. Wilson 2006. 5. Meyer 2006. 6. Kolbert 2006. <u>Realism</u> in International Relations has always enjoyed a step-up from other schools of thought insofar as it proclaims itself immune from starry-eyed utopianism. <u>By claiming to be realistic rather than idealistic, it has enjoyed a permanent seat at the table</u> (indeed, it usually sits at the head). <u>By analogy, problem-solving theory in Environmental Studies has likewise won legitimacy and appears particularly attractive as a new environmental day is, arguably, beginning to dawn. It has claimed itself to be the most reasonable and policyrelevant.</u> But, we must ask ourselves, how realistic is problem-solving theory when the numbers of people currently suffering from environmental degradation—either as mortal victims or environmental refugees—are rising and the gathering evidence that global-scale environmental conditions are being tested as never before is becoming increasingly obvious. We must ask ourselves how realistic problem-solving theory is when most of our actions to date pursue only thin elements of environmental protection with little attention to the wider, deeper and longer-term dimensions. In this context, it becomes clear that our notions of realism must shift. And, the obligation to commence such a shift sits squarely on the shoulders of Environmental Studies scholars. That is, communicating the realistic relevance of environmental critical theory is our disciplinary responsibility. <u>For too long, environmental critical theory has prided itself on its arcane language. As theoreticians, we have scaled the 9heights of abstraction as we have been enamored with the intricacies of sophisticated theory-building and philosophical reflection. In so doing, we have often adopted a discourse of high theory and somehow felt obligated to speak in tongues, as it were.</u> Part of this is simply the difficulty of addressing complex issues in ordinary language. But another part has to do with feeling the scholarly obligation to pay our dues to various thinkers, philosophical orientations and so forth. Indeed, some of it comes down to the impulse to sound unqualifiedly scholarly—as if saying something important demands an intellectual artifice that only the best and brightest can understand. Such practice does little to shift the boundary between problemsolving and critical theory, as it renders critical theory incommunicative to all but the narrowest of audiences. In some ways, the key insights of environmentalism are now in place. We recognize the basic dynamic of trying to live ecologically responsible lives. We know, for example, that Homo sapiens cannot populate the earth indefinitely; we understand that our insatiable appetite for resources cannot be given full reign; we know that the earth has a limit to how much waste it can absorb and neutralize. We also understand that our economic, social and political systems are ill-fitted to respect this knowledge and thus, as social thinkers, we must research and prescribe ways of altering the contemporary world order. While we, as environmental scholars, take these truths to be essentially self-evident, it is clear that many do not. As default critical theorists, we thus need to make our job one of meaningful communicators.We need to find metaphors, analogies, poetic expressions and a host of other discursive techniques for communicating the very real and present dangers of environmental degradation. <u>We need to do this especially in these challenging and shadowy times. Resuscitating and refining critical Environmental Studies is not simply a matter of cleaning up our language. It is also about rendering a meaningful relationship between transformational, structural analysis and reformist, policy prescription. Yes, a realistic environmental agenda must understand itself as one step removed from the day-to-day incrementalism of problem-solving theory.</u> It must retain its ability to step back from contemporary events and analyze the structures of power at work. It must, in other words, preserve its critical edge. <u>Nonetheless, it also must take some responsibility for fashioning a bridge to contemporary policy initiatives. It must analyze how to embed practical, contemporary policy proposals</u> (associated with, for example, a cap-and-trade system) <u>into transformative, political scenarios.Contemporary policies, while inadequate themselves to engage the magnitude of environmental challenges, can nevertheless be guided in a range of various directions. Critical Environmental Studies can play a “critical” role by interpreting such policies in ways that render them consonant with longer-range transformative practices or at least explain how such policies can be reformulated to address the root causes of environmental harm. This entails radicalizing incrementalism—specifying the relationship between superstructural policy reforms and structural political transformation.</u></strong></em><br />

Policy is seen as the job of politicians, while science is for the scientists — and too seldom the twain do meet. The result is a dichotomy that, in the case of energy policy, has potentially very serious ramifications. Underlying this dichotomy are fundamental differences in perspective, methodology, training, and temperament. Policy development is by no means an exact science, and rarely does it produce exact results. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Scientific methods do not apply. </span>Policy decisions emerge from compromise based on recognition of common goals, and successful policy makers are skilled negotiators. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The policy-making process</span>, to an outsider, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">looks messy and imprecise</span>, particularly when contrasted with the disciplines of scientific inquiry. By the same token, the rigorous process and methods of scientific research can appear plodding, tedious, and unimaginative to the untrained eye. Scientists inhabit a rarefied environment, and the bigger the science, the more rarefied it becomes. The same holds true of policy makers, who, at the global level, occupy a very exclusive domain. On a structural level, <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">there is no real framework for routinized interaction</span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> between these two rarefied worlds</span>; they operate independently of each other. Moreover, on a more human level, it is easy to see how pride of place can become a very real obstacle to productive interchange. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Yet it is precisely in cases like SSP </span>— which by any definition is big science with big policy implications — <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">where </span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">such interchange is critical</span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">. And it cannot happen without the </span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">active engagement</span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> of the scientific community.Active engagement</span>, in this instance, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">means expanding the traditional role of the scientific expert in policy development. This traditional role has usually been limited to providing input, rather than actively participating in deliberations. </span>Science committees may provide subject-expert testimony, technical briefings or expert reviews, with the goal of educating policy makers on specific topics, but their focus is almost exclusively technical. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Such committees more often than not function largely in isolation from broader policy bodies,</span> with little overlap in membership or voting rights. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">In the case of SSP </span>and the broad question of global energy alternatives, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">this approach seems </span>limited if not <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">profoundly flawed.</span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Sound science must be </span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the foundation</span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> of any energy policy</span>, not a sidebar to the debate. This means that <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">scientists should be engaging in</span>, rather than simply supporting or informing, th<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">e policy-making process. Fully integrating scientific expertise into the policy development process would yield several</span> important, related <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">benefits: for the public, greater assurance of sound science; for policy makers, improved appreciation of science's role</span> and contributions; <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">for scientists, better understanding of the context and impact of their work.</span> Most important, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">such improved integration would almost certainly </span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">produce sounder policy</span></em> — a goal that surely all would endorse. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Active engagement also means taking an advocacy role with regard to SSP. </span>While many scientists are deft politicians and passionate advocates in their own community, they generally do not apply these talents outside it, and the idea of doing so is largely alien — if not outright distasteful. However, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">policy bodies cannot be expected to seek out new science, and if SSP is to emerge as a serious candidate </span>among the options for meeting the energy demands of the 21st century, as NASA's Fresh Look study suggests, <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">it needs to be brought before them.</span></em> The characterization of SSP as a ‘candidate’ is an especially apt one in this context. In political terms, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">SSP is a dark horse with limited name recognition</span>, running against a powerful incumbent (conventional fuels), an established contender (nuclear power), and an intriguing potential newcomer (cold fusion). <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">For such a candidate to be considered, much less endorsed, it needs first </span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">to be known</span> <strong>— introduced to the people and deliberative bodies who will determine its viability as an option. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The multinational scientific community that has studied and evolved SSP must now act as its advocate in the policy arena</span> — specifically within the UN system as well as at the member state level. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">What is needed is a concerted effort and a collective strategy that builds and capitalizes on the initiatives undertaken by individual experts</span>, many of whom have established valuable relationships with key government and commercial decision makers <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">through their advocacy of SSP. Such an effort</span>, to be successful, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">should reflect a campaign mentality and there is no doubt that this will require a significant shift in perspective for SSP scientists</span>. For some, the transition may be awkward, and some may feel that the advocacy role is inappropriate. However, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">science has a proud tradition of activism on behalf of the common good, and aggressive advocacy of SSP is fully in keeping with this tradition</span>. Moreover, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">those most knowledgeable about SSP science are </span>by far <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the best equipped to make a case for it</span>, in terms of both its underlying technology and its potential environmental and societal benefits. Finally, though, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the most compelling case for concerted advocacy is the fact that SSP </span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">cannot be realized without it</span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">. No one is holding a place at the table for SSP in the policy arena, and if scientists themselves do not first make and then take that place, </span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">no one else will do it for them</span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">.</span></strong><br />

<strong>We must not obscure the issue by characterizing this type of case as the sacrifice of individuals for some abstract &quot;social entity.&quot; <u>It is not a question of some persons having to bear the cost for some elusive &quot;overall social good.&quot; Instead, the question is whether some persons must bear the inescapable cost for the sake of other persons.</u> Robert <u>Nozick</u>, for example, <u>argues that &quot;to use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a separate person, that his is the only life he has.&quot;</u>12 <u>But why is this not equally true of all those whom we do not save through our failure to act? By emphasizing solely the one who must bear the cost if we act, we fail to sufficiently respect and take account of the many other separate persons, each with only one life, who will bear the cost of our inaction.</u> In such a situation, <u>what would a conscientious Kantian agent, an agent motivated by the unconditional value of rational beings, choose? A morally good agent recognizes that the basis of all particular duties is the principle that &quot;rational nature exists as an end in itself&quot;</u> (GMM 429). <u>Rational nature as such is the supreme objective end of all conduct. If one truly believes that all rational beings have an equal value, then the rational solution to such a dilemma involves maximally promoting the lives and liberties of as many rational beings as possible</u> (chapter 5). [end p.145] In order to avoid this conclusion, the non-consequentialist Kantian needs to justify agent-centered constraints. As we saw in chapter 1, however, <u>even most Kantian deontologists recognize that agent-centered constraints require a non-value-based rational</u>e. But we have seen that Kant's normative theory is based on an unconditionally valuable end. <u>How can a concern for the value of rational beings lead to a refusal to sacrifice rational beings even when this would prevent other more extensive losses of rational beings? If the moral law is based on the value of rational beings and their ends, then what is the rationale for prohibiting a moral agent from maximally promoting these two tiers of value? If I sacrifice some for the sake of others, I do not use them arbitrarily, and I do not deny the unconditional value of rational beings. Persons may have &quot;dignity, that is, an unconditional and incomparable worth&quot; that transcends any market value</u> (GMM 436), <u>but persons also have a fundamental equality that dictates that some must sometimes give way for the sake of others</u> (chapters 5 and 7). <u>The concept of the end-in-itself does not support the view that we may never force another to bear some cost in order to benefit others. If one focuses on the equal value of all rational beings, then equal consideration suggests that one may have to sacrifice some to save many.</u></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The</span> immiseration <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">objection claims that there is a 'race to the bottom' for labor, in that capital will seek out ever cheaper labor</span> to hire and this will cause laborers to compete by accepting lower and lower wages. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The argument depends on the assumption that there is a large supply of unemployed</span> and interchangeable labor that can be tapped at will, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">and that capital can flow freely to exploit these laborers</span>. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">These conditions </span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">do not hold</span> <strong>precisely</strong> <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">in practice</span><strong>, though it is at the heart of the feminist objection to capitalism that women and children are often exploited in this way. It is surely true that labor will seek out the best wages available within other constraints that one's way of life imposes. Capital has to compete for labor with other firms, and so the going wage will depend on what other firms exist, as well as on what other options a society offers persons who are unable or unwilling to work for the wages offered. The better the outside option, then the better position labor has to bargain for higher wages. But likewise, the more mobile capital is, the better able it will be to seek out workers in different places whose outside options are worse and demands for wages are lower. Those unemployed laborers who are out there willing to accept the low wages are, after all, presumably better off when they earn the low wages than they were when they earned nothing. So it is not possible to say analytically how this works out; it has to be empirically determined. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The real moral question then is this: does capitalism improve the available options to the most vulnerable</span> women and children? <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">One of the key findings of international trade economists is that when a new international firm enters a developing market, </span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">wages as a whole rise in the region</span><strong>. ^ This suggests that <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">more capitalist trade and production </span></strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">increases wages</span>**. In some cases, governments will intervene to artificially lower wages and raise the level of production in ways that a free market would not support, say by outlawing unions or breaking strikes. Although this no doubt happens in many places in the world, it is the result of political and social oppression by governments, and hardly to be blamed on the capitalist system per se. An analogy would be blaming the political oppression of communist leaders on the socialist economic system. Any economic system will leave open the possibility for unscrupulous but powerful leaders to exploit the system and oppress people. On the other hand, governments may also interact in ways that raise wages, such as by giving the companies tax breaks or other incentives to locate in the country. Whether they govern socialist or capitalist systems, governments need to be responsive to the people; they can create much good or much harm regardless of the economic system they oversee.<br />

$400–500 billion is a hard sum to get out of Congress, even in $30 billion chunks. It may not be so difficult in 15 years time. In 1994, the USAF looked at a number of scenarios for the world back in their Spacecast 2020 excercise. They predicted that the economy would be twice as big in 2020. Taking a point and a growth rate from the CIA World Factbook, their prediction is not too far off the best we can do today. There will probably be a trillionaire by 2020. If world GDP is $100 trillion by then, its assets, if fully monetized at 5% interest rate, would be worth $2 quadrillion. That trillionaire would likely not want to put all his eggs in one basket. There might not be a lot of other good places to invest any more. It’s hard to say. Many developments could occur to make the financials for LSP look much better such as space solar, Lunar tourism, orbital tourism, and space elevators. These industries have substantial overlap with what is required for cheap LSP. However, prior to necessity, LSP will require government seed money. Politics is particularly fickle. Trying to explain why LSP is better than helium-3 mining or converting to a hydrogen economy requires physics and economics knowledge that is two levels removed from most legislators. The political class mostly does not associate with the scientific and economics academics (and this issue would require both at once). And if they did, the academics do not have the vocabulary to communicate the issue. Much will depend on resonance with the national mood. Who picks the movies that will be hits? Getting a hit major policy initiative is a lot like getting a hit patent, hit movie or hit song. There are some promoters that can do it well, but few that can do it for sure. And those great lobbyists and statesmen who occasionally reshape public opinion will have their own agenda to push. Therefore it is likely to be a long fight before LSP is funded even by a rich planet. LSP starts with a heavy handicap. There are a gaggle more of well-funded fuel industries that would be threatened if LSP came to fruition such as carbon, uranium, and deuterium. When there is diffuse benefit and concentrated harm, a policy initiative has a particularly rough time to gain friends in the face of such persistent enemies.<br />

Criswell [S7] does not discuss this, but because of the 2-week on/ 2-week off nature of lunar solar availability, such a base would operate on a 2-week on/off cycle. To provide power during the 2-week dark periods, Criswell conjectures that this array of bases on the side of the Moon facing Earth &quot;would be augmented by fields of solar converters located on the back side of the Moon, 500 to 1,000 km beyond each visible edge and connected to the Earth-facing power bases by electric transmission lines.&quot; He also points out that the &quot;Moon[doesn’t] receives sunlight continuously except during a full lunar eclipse, which occurs approximately once a year and lasts for less than three hours.&quot; He suggests that &quot;energy stored on Earth as hydrogen, synthetic gas, dammed water, and other forms could be released during a short eclipse&quot; but supplying up to 20 TW from storage would seem to be a formidable (and very costly) enterprise<br />

Avian and bat impacts of wind-energy facilities are not homogenously distributed across the United States, but instead vary by species and region.14 <u>Studies show high levels of bird and bat kills at wind farms in California and Appalachia</u>, respectively, while studies on wind facilities in other regions of the country reveal lower mortality levels.15 While overall <u>the most frequent fatalities at wind farms are night-migrating passerines</u>,16 the case is quite different at the Altamont Pass wind <u>facility in northern California, where over 1000 raptors are killed annually</u>.17 <u>These avian impacts, ongoing for over twenty years,18 have generated a high level of concern among biologists, as has the more recent discovery19 of unprecedented bat kills at wind facilities in West Virginia and Pennsylvania20</u>—for example, over 2000 at sixty-four turbines over one six-week period.21 Compared to other species, <u>fatalities such as these probably have more damaging population effects</u> on raptors and bats, <u>as both are long-lived with characteristically low reproductive rates, and also due to the “relatively low abundance of raptors.”</u>22 <u>Further, little is currently known about bat movement, migration, and behavior,23 thus making effective avoidance and mitigation planning difficult, if not impossible.</u> More positively, a recent National Research Council study found “no evidence of significant impacts” on avian populations in general at the present installed U.S. wind power generation level.24 <u>Bird collisions with wind turbines were estimated to be between 20,000 and 37,000</u> in 2003, according to the Council.25 In another congressionally commissioned study, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted that if wind power expansion in the United States meets its stated goal—growing from generating less than 1% of U.S. electricity in 2004 to 5% by 2020—over 62,000 wind turbines would need to be constructed, adding to the 16,000 turbines already in existence.26 <u>This growth could bring the estimated annual total of bird fatalities to approximately 217,000</u>.27 According to Erickson et al., however, even if the number of domestic wind turbines expanded to one million, they would still most likely “cause no more than a few percent of all [avian] collision deaths related to human structures.”28<br />

Biological Diversity. -- The main premise of species preservation is that <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">diversity is better than simplicity</span>. 77 As the current mass extinction has progressed, the world's biological diversity generally has decreased.

<em>A panel of experts from inside and outside government debated that question at a forum in Washington earlier this month held by the Secure World Foundation. Their assessment, not surprisingly, is that the administration’s implementation of the policy is very much a work in progress, with clear efforts underway in some areas but lacking in others.</em><br />
<em>“<strong>Implementing the policy is far more difficult”</strong> than writing it, said Peter Marquez, who in his previous position as director of space policy for the National Security Council led the development of the national space policy. A new policy often comes in conflict with existing programs, a situation he analogized with a person who says he’ll start a diet tomorrow, only to have that plan run afoul of a business lunch or other exigency. “The president knows that full well when he signs on to the document: that that is my desire, but that sometimes desires don’t match up with reality.” Marquez, who left the government last fall to become a vice president at Orbital Sciences Corporation, offered his assessment of how the administration was addressing various elements of the policy. He said the administration is making progress in areas like assured access to space, with work starting on a revamp of the national space transportation policy that dates back to 2004. The government is also taking steps to address ongoing problems with space procurement, examining alternative approaches ranging from block buys of systems to hosting government payloads on commercial satellites. “DOD is, by and large, the most prolific procurer of capabilities, and DOD is aware that they have a problem, which I think is a key first step,” he said. He also singled out the administration’s policy on positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), citing a specific issue he said has become “one of the greatest time sucks” in recent months. That issue, which has gained broader attention only within the last few weeks, involves plans by one company, LightSquared, to deploy a wireless broadband system using a combination of terrestrial and satellite infrastructure. Other companies warned that LightSquared’s system could interfere with GPS receivers, effectively jamming them, a conclusion backed by test results released in recent weeks. “The recent activity with LightSquared has taken the majority of everybody’s time who works space issues, whether they’re at State, whether they’re at DOD, or whether they’re at the White House,” Marquez said. He said the efforts of the administration, in concert with industry and foreign governments, to “fight off” LightSquared were an “A-plus moment for the implementation of the president’s space policy”, whose provisions include a call to “invest in domestic capabilities and support international activities to detect, mitigate, and increase resiliency to harmful interference to GPS.” He added that among the recent recommendations regarding LightSquared by the National Space-Based PNT Advisory Board—on which he serves—was that the company’s spectrum allocation be moved away from any global navigation system, not just GPS. “It was an awareness by the US’s advisory board that the foreign PNT systems were just as valuable as US domestic PNT systems, again, reflecting back to what was in the president’s policy,” he said. In other areas of the policy, though, the administration has made little progress to date. The government “has not done a very good job at the SSA [space situational awareness] portions and orbital debris directives that are in the national space policy,” Marquez said. While SSA is critical to safe and responsible space operations—one of the central tenets of the overall policy—it’s not adequately funded, he said. Export control reform is another area that has seen little progress, given disagreements between the White House and Congress. “I don’t really know if there’s going to be any move forward on export control,” he said.</em><br />
<em>Marquez also noted some mixed messages about another aspect of the policy, involving “mission assurance” of space capabilities. While key military officials have expressed their support for this, he said, they may not be interpreting that concept the same way as <strong>originally intended.</strong> “When the term ‘mission assurance’ was put into the policy, my intent was not to mean assuring the satellite’s function,” he said. “That was the last thing in my mind. What was really meant there was to assure the satellite’s reason for being.” In other words, if that space-based system failed, there was some backup system, be it in space or on the ground, to carry out that role. “So far we’ve been wrapped around the axle of how to gold-plate a satellite so that it functions in all conditions, and that was the wrong approach.”</em><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">While panelists discussed details about implementation, and its affect on initiatives like the EU Code of Conduct, they also weighed in on a bigger question: just how influential has the new policy been? Some questioned how big of an impact it’s had, at least so far. “Everything that happened in this last year, and everything that’s going to happen in the next year, <strong>is completely independent</strong> of that national space policy,” said Palowitch. His rationale is that it takes years to plan and carry out major space programs, and thus a new policy has little effect on programs already in some phase of development and operations. “Changes do not happen rapidly in space.” Government activities in the last year, from the surge in national security satellite launches to the impending retirement of the Space Shuttle, had their roots in decisions made long <strong>before the policy’s release</strong>, he noted, while commercial activities are largely independent of national space policy and are based on economic rationales. Even discussion about the EU Code, he argued, had their basis outside of the policy. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">The skwo solves your net benefit AND the plan internal link turns it, targeted policies are key </span></strong></span><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">An obvious problem with this approach is that the space enterprise has become so large and diverse that no single policy document can be truly comprehensive. For the past three decades, every <strong>administration has seen fit to issue multiple space policies</strong> targeting activities such as space transportation, commerce, remote sensing, navigation and exploration. Those targeted policies have been the ones that have provided the clearest guidance to U.S. agencies, influencing the development and implementation of their space-related programs. The last two administrations issued all of their targeted policies many months prior to their national space policies. If the targeted policies provide better guidance and tend to precede the national space policy, then what is the value of the national space policy? Many analysts say it’s needed to tie together the components of the space community’s activities and deliver “overarching” guidance. While it’s true that the various space sectors have become increasingly interdependent, their representation in national space policies is no more tied together than the selections on a restaurant menu. Once again, the targeted policies do a better job; no matter which specific activity is addressed, they must recognize and deal with the interplay between the civil, commercial and national security sectors. The only part of the national space policy that is overarching is the language at the beginning of the document laying out principles and goals. Many interested parties believe the Obama administration should rewrite the national space policy directive soon, and complete it before undertaking any targeted policies. If this is done using the same approach as the previous two presidents’ administrations, <strong>lengthy and costly delays</strong> — not better policy — will be the result. Bill Clinton signed his national space policy three-and-a-half years into his presidency; for George W. Bush, it was five-and-a-half years, following nearly three years of effort by a host of hardworking people across the executive agencies. The illusion of comprehensiveness compels every stakeholder agency to demand a seat at the table for every step of the process, even though they may be interested in only a small subset of the issues. During a significant portion of the gestation of the Bush policy, the staff of the National Security Council and the Office of Science and Technology Policy presided over weekly interagency meetings involving 20 to 30 participants. The attendee list eventually was reduced, but over the three-year period, thousands of staff hours were expended to cover the frequent meetings and support the work within the agencies. Despite this huge effort, the result was a policy that the administration initially sought to keep at a very low profile and eventually portrayed as being not significantly different from the one it replaced. It has long been recognized that certain basic space policy tenets have been with us since the early days of the space age and remain uncontroversial, such as the commitment to explore and use space for peaceful purposes, the rejection of claims of sovereignty in space, the importance of scientific discovery, and the desirability of international cooperation. In both the Clinton and Bush national space policies, the nation’s space principles and goals were stated in less than two pages. If the United States wishes to create an overarching space document, the solution should be a two- or three-page National Space Principles and Goals statement. If the drafters could resist the temptation to insert unnecessary language, this could be completed quickly because it would contain only the fundamentals that have been overwhelmingly agreed upon for the past half-century. It should not require an army of people to develop, and it should not need to be rewritten by each new administration. The rest of the nation’s needs for top-level space guidance should be addressed by targeted space policies. This likely would result in a larger number of space policies than has been the case in recent administrations, but ultimately they could provide better guidance more quickly using fewer staff resources. Agency representatives could stay focused on their areas of expertise, and attend only those interagency meetings that addressed their interests, allowing concurrent development of multiple targeted policies. Another important consideration in this process is whether the existing targeted policies need to be replaced or simply amended. The policies on remote sensing (National Security Presidential Directive 27, or NSPD-27, April 2003) and positioning, navigation and timing (NSPD-39, December 2004) are holding up quite well, and may need no more than updated language to reflect the implications of evolving international capabilities in these areas. In contrast, the policies on space exploration (NSPD-31, January 2004) and transportation (NSPD-40, December 2004) need to be completely rewritten because so much has changed, requiring significant rethinking and revised guidance. New stand-alone documents on national security space, commercial space, orbital debris and space nuclear power may be desirable under this approach, but none of these needs to be more than a couple of pages. An important addition would be a policy that combines space exploration and development, two endeavors that must be considered in parallel if both are to prosper. Exploration provides the science, adventure and inspiration, while development enhances the relevance to society and ultimately will generate wealth and thus provide the means to continue exploration. If moving human activity out into the solar system is among the nation’s goals, then exploration and development must share a long-term strategy that treats them as mutually reinforcing activities. Space as a public policy issue has been around for only a half-century, so we are still developing fresh ideas on how to deal with it. One of our objectives should be that space policy should not present each new administration with a policy-formulation project that encompasses most of its time in office. </span><br />

By contrast, <u>the German satellite will observe what are known as &quot;inner Earth objects,&quot; which are traveling closer to Earth</u>. &quot;<u>Up until now there have been no efforts to try to find this type of asteroid,&quot; Kührt explains.</u> There are a lot of problems to solve, not the least of which is fairly mundane-sounding issue: If you stare into the sun during the day, you will have little serious chance of seeing any stars. So how can one hope to be able to recognize a few comparably small, faint stones? To some degree the AsteroidFinder has good potential to overcome this issue: <u>Its planned orbit takes it around the earth along the border of day and night, also known as the Terminator line or the twilight zone</u>. No matter what, the 25 centimeter telescope will still need to be able to make highly precise scans. In theory the satellite will be carrying a computer chip, similar to the kind that is used in commercial digital cameras. But the chip must be cooled down to temperatures as low as -80 Celsius and be exceptionally good at filtering out any static. Fast shutter speeds should help ensure that the pictures are not as out of focus as some jittery holiday snapshot of a walk on the beach at dawn. <u>Numerous snapshots from the satellite will be used to compose the celestial images</u>. Each day, AsteroidFinder is expected to send around 14 gigabytes of data back to Earth at the DLR station in Neustrelitz. &quot;We have to pick up extremely small signals,&quot; DLR scientist Peter Spietz says. <u>The space agency is then able to calculate the path of the asteroids after collecting several days worth of data</u>. Small Budgets, But Considerable Responsibility Spietz appears tense. He has to coordinate specialists from eight DLR institutes, all of whom are working on the project. The budget is comparatively small, but the responsibility is significant. The scientists also want to use the project to show that satellites can be built more cheaply and still remain reliable. &quot;We want to create price-effective projects, within shorter time frames,&quot; says Hansjörg Dittus, the head of the Institute of Space Systems in Bremen. The scientists hope that <u>if the asteroid scout is successful, that they can use the same technology to build other types of observational satellites. They will be able to use the same substructure</u> -- power, layout and communication systems -- <u>to create other similar instruments</u>. Work on the asteroid project is expected to last three more years. The pressure on the scientists behind the satellite will be huge if it flops. But nobody wants to think about that. Specifications for the satellite's individual components are expected to be completed by the end of the year, but there is still plenty of work to do. Afterwards, AstroidFinder will be built and then tested under the strenuous conditions it would undergo in outer space: It will be shaken, frozen and irradiated.</em><br />

Large near-Earth object impacts, while they are comparatively rare compared to calderia volcanoes as a natural initiator of global catastrophes, are of special interest as <u>sufficient space capability would enable deflection of destruction of the incoming object—thus fully preventing the catastrophe</u>. This has been the subject of considerable recent literature and while many different approaches have been proposed all of them require a considerably greater space infrastructure than currently available. The size of asteroid required to create a global catastrophe is a matter of some debate. Harrison et al. [21] suggest that 1 km size object is just below a threshold where global effects could cause a catastrophe level event. Whereas Rigby et al. [22] argue a 1 km object could have caused the Dark Ages in the 6th Century AD. So a system capable of handling a 1 km object would be the minimum required to deal with potential global catastrophe level events<u>.</u> The size of system that could deflect a NEO sufficiently to avoid collision with the Earth is also uncertain and is strongly dependent upon the assumptions made on size, orbit and timescale. A small asteroid with centuries until the potential impact may be deflected sufficiently by a single nuclear device (e.g. [23]), which is probably just about possible with the current space infrastructure. However, <u>a large comet with only a year or two warning would require systems well beyond current capability. There have been proposals for large orbital systems to deflect asteroids</u> for example that outlined by Campbell et al. [24]. <u>To deflect an</u> iron <u>asteroid using a pulsed laser was estimated to need peak powers</u> of 200 GW, which would correspond to a continuous power supply requirement in the order of 20 GW. <u>This is the output of two reference SPS satellites giving a good indication of the size of system required for this technique.</u> One suggested location was a Sun Earth Lagrange point.<br />

The smallest falling bodies, those with diameters under a few meters, are of “no practical concern,” says Chapman, and in fact they are to be desired, at least by those who keep their eyes on the skies watching for brilliant fireballs whose burning up in the atmosphere provides a show far more spectacular than the most lavish Fourth of July fireworks. Even bodies with diameters of 10–30 meters, of which Chapman estimates six may fall to earth in a century, cause little more than broken windows. They explode too high in the atmosphere to cause serious harm. The next largest potential strikers of Earth are those in the Tunguska range of 30 meters–100 meters. The shock waves from the atmospheric explosion would “topple trees, wooden structures and ignit[e] fires within 10 kilometers,” writes Chapman. Human deaths could result if the explosion took place over a populated area. Though Chapman estimates the likelihood of a Tunguska occurring in any given century at four in ten, it is worth noting that there is no evidence that such an explosion has killed a single human being in all of recorded history. Either we’re overdue or that 40 percent is high. Moreover, given that the location of such an explosion is utterly unpredictable, it would be far more likely to happen over an ocean or a desert than over, say, Tokyo or Manhattan. The after effects would be minimal, and Chapman says that “nothing practical can be done about this modest hazard other than to clean up after the event.” In fact, “It makes no sense to plan ahead for such a modest disaster… other than educating the public about the possibility.” The cost of a telescopic survey capable of picking up bodies of such diminutive size would be prohibitive. It would be the ultimate Astronomers Full Employment Act. A body of 100 meters–300 meters in diameter would either explode at low altitude or upon impact with the ground; it would be “regionally devastating,” but Chapman pegs the chances of such a catastrophe at 1 percent per century. A small nation could be destroyed by the impact of a body of 300 meters—1 km in diameter, or a “flying mountain” of sorts, which would explode with energy yield ten times more than “the largest thermonuclear bomb ever tested.” If striking land, it would carve out a crater deeper than the Grand Canyon. If it hit a populated area, the death toll could be in the hundreds of thousands. The likelihood of such a collision Chapman estimates at 0.2 percent per century. An asteroid or comet of 1–3 kilometers in diameter would cause “major regional destruction,” possibly verging on “civilization-destruction level.” Chapman puts the chances of this at 0.02 percent per century. The impact of a body more than 3 kilometers in diameter might plunge the Earth into a new Dark Age, killing most of its inhabitants, though the chances of this are “extremely remote” — less than one in 50,000 per century. Finally, mass extinction would likely occur should a body greater than 10 kilometers pay us a <u>visit</u>, though the chances of this are less than one in a million every century, or so infinitesimal that even the most worry-wracked hypochondriac will not lose sleep over the possibility. In fact, for any impact with a Chapman-calculated likelihood of less than one in a thousand per century, he concedes that there is “little justification for mounting asteroid-specific mitigation measures.” The chance of a civilization-ender is so remote that he counsels no “advance preparations” — or almost none. For Chapman recommends further study of NEOs, as well as investigation into methods of their diversion. 82 This is exactly what the NEO lobby wants.<br />

<em>By not addressing climate change more aggressively and creatively, the United States is squandering an opportunity to secure its global primacy for the next few generations to come. To do this, though, <span class="Underline">the U.S. must rely on innovation to help the world escape the coming environmental meltdown. Developing the key technologies that will save the planet from global warming will allow the U.S. to outmaneuver potential great power rivals seeking to replace it as the international system's hegemon</span>. But the greening of American strategy must occur soon. The U.S., however, seems to be stuck in time, unable to move beyond oil-centric geo-politics in any meaningful way. Often, the gridlock is portrayed as a partisan difference, with Republicans resisting action and Democrats pleading for action. This, though, is an unfair characterization as there are numerous proactive Republicans and quite a few reticent Democrats. The real divide is instead one between realists and liberals. Students of realpolitik, which still heavily guides American foreign policy, largely discount environmental issues as they are not seen as advancing national interests in a way that generates relative power advantages vis-à-vis the other major powers in the system: Russia, China, Japan, India, and the European Union. Liberals, on the other hand, have recognized that global warming might very well become the greatest challenge ever faced by mankind. As such, their thinking often eschews narrowly defined national interests for the greater global good. This, though, ruffles elected officials whose sworn obligation is, above all, to protect and promote American national interests. What both sides need to understand is that by becoming a lean, mean, green fighting machine, the U.S. can actually bring together liberals and realists to advance a collective interest which benefits every nation, while at the same time, securing America's global primacy well into the future. To do so, the U.S. must re-invent itself as not just your traditional hegemon, but as history's first ever green hegemon. Hegemons are countries that dominate the international system - bailing out other countries in times of global crisis, establishing and maintaining the most important international institutions, and covering the costs that result from free-riding and cheating global obligations. Since 1945, that role has been the purview of the United States. Immediately after World War II, Europe and Asia laid in ruin, the global economy required resuscitation, the countries of the free world needed security guarantees, and the entire system longed for a multilateral forum where global concerns could be addressed. The U.S., emerging the least scathed by the systemic crisis of fascism's rise, stepped up to the challenge and established the postwar (and current) liberal order. But don't let the world &quot;liberal&quot; fool you. While many nations benefited from America's new-found hegemony, the U.S. was driven largely by &quot;realist&quot; selfish national interests. The liberal order first and foremost benefited the U.S. With the U.S. becoming bogged down in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, running a record national debt, and failing to shore up the dollar, the future of American hegemony now seems to be facing a serious contest: potential rivals - acting like sharks smelling blood in the water - wish to challenge the U.S. on a variety of fronts. This has led numerous commentators to forecast the U.S.'s imminent fall from grace. Not all hope is lost however. With the impending systemic crisis of global warming on the horizon, the U.S. again finds itself in a position to address a transnational problem in a way that will benefit both the international community collectively and the U.S. selfishly. The current problem is two-fold. First, the <span class="Underline">competition for oil is fueling animosities between</span> the <span class="Underline">major powers</span>. The geopolitics of <span class="Underline">oil has</span> already <span class="Underline">emboldened Russia</span> in its 'near abroad' <span class="Underline">and China</span> in far-off places like Africa and Latin America. As oil is a limited natural resource, <span class="Underline">a nasty zero-sum contest</span> could be looming on the horizon for the U.S. and its major power rivals - a contest which <span class="Underline">threatens</span> American <span class="Underline">primacy and global stability</span>. Second, converting fossil fuels like oil to run national economies is producing irreversible harm in the form of carbon dioxide emissions. So long as the global economy remains oil-dependent, greenhouse gases will continue to rise. Experts are predicting as much as <span class="Underline">a 60% increase in carbon dioxide emissions</span> in the next twenty-five years. That likely <span class="Underline">means more devastating water shortages, droughts, forest fires, floods, and storms</span>. In other words, <span class="Underline">if global competition for access to energy resources does not undermine international security, global warming will</span>. And in either case, oil will be a culprit for the instability. Oil arguably has been the most precious energy resource of the last half-century. But &quot;black gold&quot; is so 20th century. The key resource for this century will be green gold - clean, environmentally-friendly energy like wind, solar, and hydrogen power. Climate change leaves no alternative. And the sooner we realize this, the better off we will be. What Washington must do in order to avoid the traps of petropolitics is to convert the U.S. into the world's first-ever green hegemon. For starters, the federal government must drastically increase investment in energy and environmental research and development (E&amp;E R&amp;D). This will require a serious sacrifice, committing upwards of $40 billion annually to E&amp;E R&amp;D - a far cry from the few billion dollars currently being spent. By promoting a new national project, the U.S. could develop new technologies that will assure it does not drown in a pool of oil. Some solutions are already well known, such as raising fuel standards for automobiles; improving public transportation networks; and expanding nuclear and wind power sources. Others, however, have not progressed much beyond the drawing board: batteries that can store massive amounts of solar (and possibly even wind) power; efficient and cost-effective photovoltaic cells, crop-fuels, and hydrogen-based fuels; and even fusion. Such innovations will not only provide alternatives to oil, they will also give the U.S. an edge in the global competition for hegemony. <span class="Underline">If the U.S. is able to produce technologies that allow</span> modern, globalized <span class="Underline">societies to escape the oil trap, those nations will</span> eventually have no choice but to <span class="Underline">adopt such technologies</span>. And this will give the U.S. a tremendous economic boom, <span class="Underline">while</span> simultaneously <span class="Underline">providing it with</span> means of <span class="Underline">leverage that can</span> be employed to <span class="Underline">keep potential foes in check</span>.</em><br />

<em>China is another matter. <u>No sane figure</u> in the Pentagon <u>wants a war with China</u>, and all serious US militarists know that China's minuscule nuclear capacity is not offensive but a deterrent against the overwhelming US power arrayed against it (twenty archaic Chinese warheads versus more than 7,000 US warheads). Taiwan, whose status constitutes the still incomplete last act of the Chinese civil war, remains the most dangerous place on earth. Much as the 1914 assassination of the Austrian crown prince in Sarajevo led to a war that no one wanted, <u>a misstep</u> in Taiwan <u>by any side could bring the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>and China into a conflict that neither wants.

In 1945, the ultimate super weapon was the atom bomb. I am interested in the ultimate super-weapon of today, since if there is any chance that the development of it will succeed, <u>this is the weapon the dictatorship of</u> <u>China has been developing to annihilate the free West at a blow</u> (or make it surrender unconditionally). The goal of eliminating the source of subversion is too important for the dictatorship of China to be deterred by financial losses or a possibility of a failure. Recall that <u>100,000 riots or protests occur every year in China, and the dictatorship may be overthrown</u> (recall Tiananmen with its replica of the Statue of Liberty) <u>unless it annihilates or subjugates the free West</u>.<br />
In his e-mail of Aug. 20, my reader Richard Mross says:<br />
Your articles about China and recent history are interesting, and very informative and chilling. I am convinced that <u>China is vigorously pursuing post-nuclear superweapons</u> <u>and I’m sure they are successfully hiding this from the West. But why then are they also spending so much money on conventional weapons like aircraft carriers, missiles, submarines?</u><br />
First of all, my reader may notice that while developing atom bombs, which made Japan surrender unconditionally, the United States continued to produce conventional weapons.<br />
This is human nature: the fear of having all eggs in one basket. But there is probably something else in the case of China. My reader has no doubt seen the Pentagon’s annual reports on the growth of China’s military power. The reports are reassuring. <u>China,</u> a backward country<u>, is trying to modernize itself and thus become more like the most technologically advanced country the Pentagon can imagine: the USA</u>. But imagine that the Pentagon discovers that China spends nothing on visible weapons. Surely even the Pentagon may become suspicious.<br />
Speaking of the United States, <u>let me take molecular nano super weapons as an example of a scientific vision</u>. Eric Drexler wrote his volume on nanotechnology in 1986, and in 2007 I received on the Internet its “20th anniversary edition updated and expanded” (630 pages). <u>If successfully developed, this scientific vision could be the ultimate super weapon of today.

It is now estimated that about twenty–five countries are in a position to make nuclear weapons rather quickly. Most countries that could have acquired nuclear military capability have refrained from doing so. Most countries do not need them. Consider Argentina, Brazil, and South Africa. Argentina and Brazil were in the process of moving toward nuclear military capability, and both decided against it–wisely I believe–because neither country needs nuclear weapons. South Africa had about half a dozen warheads and decided to destroy them.You have to have an adversary against whom you think you might have to threaten retaliation, but most countries are not in this position.

Their equation was I=PAT, which means that environmental impact is equal to population multiplied by affluence multiplied by technology. Protecting the planet seemed to require fewer people, less wealth and simpler technology — the same sort of social transformation and energy revolution that will be advocated at many Earth Day rallies on Wednesday. But among researchers who analyze environmental data, a lot has changed since the 1970s. With the benefit of their hindsight and improved equations, I’ll make a couple of predictions: 1. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">There will be no green revolution in energy or anything else. No leader or law or treaty will radically change the energy sources for people and industries in the United States or other countries. No recession or depression will make a lasting change in consumers’ passions to use energy</span>, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">make money and buy new tech</span>nology — and that, believe it or not, is good news, because... 2. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">The richer everyone gets, the greener the planet will be in the long run</span>. I realize this second prediction seems hard to believe when you consider the carbon being dumped into the atmosphere today by Americans, and the projections for <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">increasing emissions from India and China</span> as they get richer. Those projections <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">make it easy to assume that affluence</span> and technology <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">inflict more harm </span>on the environment. But while pollution can increase when a country starts industrializing, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">as people get wealthier they can afford cleaner water and air</span>. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">They start using sources of energy that are less carbon-intensive</span> — <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">and not just because they’re worried about global warming</span>. The process of “decarbonization” started long before Al Gore was born. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">The old wealth-is-bad IPAT theory may have made intuitive sense, but it didn’t jibe with the data that has been analyzed since that first Earth Day</span>. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">By the 1990s, researchers</span> realized <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">that graphs of environmental impact didn’t produce a simple upward-sloping line as countries got richer. The line more often rose, flattened out and then reversed so that it sloped downward, forming t</span>he shape of a dome or an inverted U — what’s called a <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Kuznets curve</span>. (See nytimes.com/tierneylab for an example.) <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">In dozens of studies, researchers identified Kuznets curves for a variety of environmental problems</span>. There are exceptions to the trend, especially in countries with inept governments and poor systems of property rights, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">but in general, richer is eventually greener</span>. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">As incomes go up, people often focus first on cleaning up their drinking water, and then later on air pollutants like sulfur dioxide</span>. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">As their wealth grows, people consume more energy</span>, but <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">they move to more efficient and cleaner sources</span> — <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">from wood to coal and oil, and then to natural gas and nuclear power</span>, progressively <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">emitting less carbon</span> per unit of energy. This global decarbonization trend has been proceeding at a remarkably steady rate since 1850, according to Jesse Ausubel of Rockefeller University and Paul Waggoner of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. “Once you have lots of high-rises filled with computers operating all the time, the energy delivered has to be very clean and compact,” said Mr. Ausubel, the director of the Program for the Human Environment at Rockefeller. “<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">The long-term trend is toward natural gas and nuclear power, or conceivably solar power. If the energy system is left to its own devices, most of the carbon will be out of it by 2060 or 2070.”</span> But what about all the carbon dioxide being spewed out today by Americans commuting to McMansions? Well, it’s true that American suburbanites do emit more greenhouse gases than most other people in the world (although New Yorkers aren’t much different from other affluent urbanites). But the United States and other Western countries seem to be near the top of a Kuznets curve for carbon emissions and ready to start the happy downward slope. The amount of carbon emitted by the average American has remained fairly flat for the past couple of decades, and per capita carbon emissions have started declining in some countries, like France. Some researchers estimate that the turning point might come when a country’s per capita income reaches $30,000, but it can vary widely, depending on what fuels are available. Meanwhile, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">more carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere by the expanding forests in America and other affluent countries.</span> Deforestation follows a Kuznets curve, too. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">In poor countries, forests are cleared to provide fuel and farmland, but as people gain wealth and better agricultural technology, the farm fields start reverting to forestland</span><br />

<strong><span style="color: black;">1. Jobs Bill Drains Capital</span></strong><br />
<strong>US News 9/12</strong> [“Will Congress Pass Obama's Jobs Bill?

<em>Thursday evening, President Obama spoke to both houses of Congress in the Capitol building, urging them to pass his job creation bill, the American Jobs Act. The bill is a combination of tax cuts, investments in infrastructure and benefit extensions. Obama promised that $447 billion will be completely paid for without adding the U.S. deficit. The president spoke again Monday morning in the Rose Garden about the legislation, which goes to Congress today, and he will travel to Ohio and North Carolina to promote the plan. Obama is putting much of his political capital behind the bill, which he argues includes proposals that have been supported by both sides of the aisle in the past. However it has already been criticized some on the right for being just another faulty attempt by the government to spend its way out of the economic downturn. Doug Heye labeled the bill &quot;Stimulus II&quot; and Peter Roff called for a plan that dismantles federal regulations instead. Many on [and]the left aren't happy either, arguing that package is too small. Said Brad Bannon, &quot;I don't see how you can jump start an economy with $14 trillion GNP with $450 billion in tax cuts and spending. The original stimulus of $700 billion was not nearly enough to do the job and this proposal is even smaller.&quot;</em><br />

The US Chamber of Commerce has expressed optimism that the long-delayed free trade agreement between Korea and the United States will be approved by President Barack Obama and Congress in the next six to eight weeks.<br />
John Murphy, vice president for international affairs at the USCC says the chamber has been laying the groundwork for years on the pending trade pacts with Korea, Colombia and Panama.<br />
Therefore, he said, that he's confident that Obama and Congress will approve the FTAs in the next six to eight weeks as the chamber wants to make sure the deals are approved before an annual meeting of leaders from the Asia-Pacific region in mid-November.<br />

<em>Advocates for SBSP are hoping to secure some support for developing the technology from the Obama administration, given the incoming president's pledge to make developing alternative energy sources a top priority. They have posted a white paper on the topic on the transition website, change.gov. One thing that surely helps their cause is that one of Obama's transition team members for NASA is George Whitesides, who has been a vocal advocate for SBSP.

Kim said that was the power of free trade, stressing that there is no more time to waste in promoting a free trade agreement (FTA) with China before it gets more sophisticated and makes striking a deal with it even more time-consuming. Kim, Korea’s top trade negotiator came off as a minimalist in his promotion of free trade, obviously skipping to mention the likelihood that the record of La Bamba he listened to was pirated with little copyrights enforced. “I want to emphasize that as China keeps growing, so will the degree of difficulty in making a deal with the country,” Kim said, adding that China is also enthusiastic about removing trade barriers.<br />

Through <strong>delegation</strong> Congress shirks responsibility for some of the most fundamental political questions affecting our society - for example, how to balance the risk of toxic agents in the workplace against jobs, n16 or how to compare the gravity of drug offenses to espionage activities. n17 Congress has failed to agree upon which military bases to close, n18 and which organizations merit broadcast licenses. n19 Yet members of Congress can claim credit for attempting to solve the problems of the environment and the economy by authorizing agencies to tackle the problems, and then distance themselves from the ensuing regulation if unfavorable to their constituents. <strong>Delegation</strong> permits legislators to &quot;look good&quot; to their constituents without necessarily providing tangible benefits (pp. 8687). n20 Congress may too readily distribute rights without imposing [*715] commensurate obligations, concealing the tradeoffs that must necessarily follow (p. 9).<br />

Scott blamed Obama for the delay. &quot;Many of those dollars could have gone a long way toward more American jobs if President Obama had sent those agreements to Congress and pushed for immediate ratification,&quot; Scott said in a statement. &quot;Leadership from the president on this is long overdue.&quot; But here's the rub. Scott called for Obama to send the trade agreements to Congress &quot;with no strings attached.&quot; That last phrase is essentially a rejection of the Democratic plan to link the passage of the agreements to a program to assist American workers who might lose their jobs if their employers relocate their services overseas as a result of the new trade deals. Obama made it clear in his speech that he still supports such a worker-assistance effort. &quot;Now it's time to clear the way for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for American companies to sell their products in Panama and Colombia and South Korea — while also helping the workers whose jobs have been affected by global competition,&quot; Obama said. Florida Democrats came to Obama's defense, saying Scott's &quot;no strings&quot; proposal would be a &quot;job killing&quot; move. &quot;Gov. Scott has failed to see the folly of previous trade agreements that have resulted in the loss of American jobs overseas,&quot; said state Rep. Dwight Bullard, D-Miami. &quot;I would caution Gov. Scott to not be so quick to send 700,000 jobs overseas but instead to employ 700,000 Floridians who are out of work today.&quot; As to whether Congress will approve the trade deals <strong>remains in doubt</strong> because Republicans have raised questions about the worker-assistance program, which at one time had a cost approaching $1 billion. Some observers believe the trade deals, like many other issues in Washington, may remain in a stalemate as the Democrats and Republicans <strong>continue to clash heading toward the 2012 elections.</strong><br />

<span style="color: #0d0d0d;">Martin Hoffert, former chair of the Department of Applied Sciences at New York University, told members of the Capitol Hill Club in August that <strong>space solar power</strong> research and development can proceed with existing technologies. But the potential costs remain high, discouraging entrepreneurs and the government from investing in it. The major expense -- transporting equipment and materials into orbit aboard a space shuttle -- is $20,000 per kilogram of payload, or the carrying capacity of a space vehicle. Proponents of <strong>space solar power</strong> believe the project would become viable economically if the payload cost could be reduced to below $200 per kilogram, and the total expense of delivery and robotic assembly on orbit could be brought below $3,500 per kilogram.</span><br />
<span style="color: #0d0d0d;">That is not likely to happen any time soon and a reusable launch vehicle, needed to reduce costs drastically, eventually would require government investment, Mankins said. He said, however, that a small-scale demonstration project of the <strong>space solar power</strong> concept could help convince skeptics and provide a strong political justification for such an investment.</span><br />

<strong>Space weapons inevitable</strong><br />
<strong>a) Rising powers- makes heg try or die</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration: none;">Dolman 10</span> [Everett, PhD and Professor of Comparative Military Studies @ US Air Force School of Advanced Air and Space Studies and Recipient of Central Intelligence’s Outstanding Intelligence Analyst Award, “The Case for Weapons in Space: A Geopolitical Assessment,” September, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1532576" rel="nofollow">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1532576</a> <em>STRONG]</em><br />
<em>This is the context in which the world now exists. The relatively stable global hegemony of US dominance since 1945, punctuated by limited wars and shifting balances of opposition, has relied on technology-dominant global power projection. Today, that technology is wholly integrated and inextricable from space support, and no state relies more on space power for its economic and security well-being than the US. Any effort to deny space capabilities would be a direct challenge to its hegemonic power, and the United States must confront the usurper or abdicate its leadership position. To be sure, China’s increasing space emphasis and its cultural antipathy to military transparency suggests that a serious attempt at seizing control of space is in the works. A lingering fear is the sudden introduction of an unknown capability (call it Technology X) that would allow a hostile state to place multiple weapons into orbit quickly and cheaply. The advantages gained from controlling the high ground of space would accrue to it as surely as to any other state, and the concomitant loss of military power from the denial of space to America’s already-dependent military forces could cause <strong>the immediate demise of the extant international system</strong>. The longer the United States dithers on its military responsibilities, the more likely a potential opponent could seize low-earth orbit before America is able to respond. And in such circumstances, the US certainly would respond. Conversely, if America were to weaponize space, it is not at all sure that any other state or group of states would find it rational to counter in kind. The entry cost to provide the necessary infrastructure is still too high—hundreds of billions of dollars, at minimum. 1. They might oppose American interests with asymmetric balancing, depending on how aggressively it uses its new power, but the likelihood of a hemorrhaging arms race in space should the United States deploy weapons first—at least for the next few years—is remote. This reasoning does not dispute the fact that US deployment of weapons in outer space would represent the addition of a potent new military capacity, one that would assist in extending the current period of American hegemony well into the future. Clearly this would be intimidating, and America must expect severe condemnation and increased competition in peripheral areas. But such an outcome is less threatening than another, particularly non-liberal authoritarian state doing so, as the necessity of a response in kind is compelling. Placement of weapons in space by the United States would be perceived correctly as an attempt at continuing American hegemony. Although there is obvious opposition to the current international balance of power, the majority of states seem to regard it as at least tolerable. A continuation of the status quo is thus minimally acceptable, even to states working toward its demise. As long as the United States does not employ its power arbitrarily, the situation would be bearable initially and grudgingly accepted over time. Mirror-imaging does not apply here. An attempt by China to dominate space would be part of an effort to break the land-sea-air dominance of the United States in preparation for a new international order. Such an action would challenge the status quo, rather than seek to perpetuate it. This would be disconcerting to nations that accept, no matter how grudgingly, the current international order—including the venerable institutions of trade, finance, and law that operate within it—and intolerable to the United States. As leader of the current system, the United States could do no less than engage in a perhaps ruinous space arms race, save graciously decide to step aside and accept a diminished world status. Seizing the initiative and securing low-Earth orbit now, while the United States is dominant in space infrastructure, would do much to stabilize the international system and prevent an arms race in space. The enhanced ability to deny any attempt by another nation to place military assets in space and to readily engage and destroy terrestrial anti-satellite capacity would make the possibility of large-scale space war or military space races less likely, not more. Why would a state expend the effort to compete in space with a superpower that has the extraordinary advantage of holding securely the highest ground at the top of the gravity well? So long as the controlling state demonstrates a capacity and a will to use force to defend its position, in effect expending a small amount of violence as needed to prevent a greater conflagration in the future, the likelihood of a future war in space is remote.</em><br />

It is a rule in strategy, one derived empirically from the evidence of two and a half millennia, that anything of great strategic importance to one belligerent, for that reason has to be worth attacking by others. And the greater the importance, the greater has to be the incentive to damage, disable, capture, or destroy it. In the bluntest of statements: space warfare is a certainty in the future because the use of space in war has become vital. . . . Regardless of public sentimental or environmentally shaped attitudes towards space as the pristine final frontier, space warfare is coming.20 The strategic value of space to states is not in question. Advanced spacefaring states are already reliant—and moving toward dependence—on space-derived services for activities across every sector of their societies. Spacepower is becoming critical to their styles of warfighting. Likewise, the injury that can be caused to such states by menacing their space systems can be considerable. Given these incentives, the beast of war will either break its chains all at once or stretch them slowly over time.21<br />

<em>One type of arms control accord on activities in space would be quite comprehensive, calling for no testing, production, or deployment of ASATs of any kind, based in space or on the ground, at any time; no Earth-attack weapons stationed in space, ever; and formal, permanent treaties codifying these prohibitions. These provisions are in line with those in proposals made by the Chinese and Russian delegations to the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. They also are supported by some traditional arms control proponents who argue that space should be a sanctuary from weaponization and that the Outer Space Treaty already strongly suggests as much.14 These provisions suffer from three main flaws. To begin, it is difficult to be sure that other countries' satellite payloads are not ASATs. This is especially true in regard to microsatellites, which are hard to track. Some have proposed inspections of all payloads going into orbit, but this would not prevent a &quot;breakout,&quot; in which a country on the verge of war would simply refuse to continue to abide by the provisions. Since microsats can be tested for maneuverability without making them look like ASATs and are being so tested, it will be difficult to preclude this scenario. A similar problem arises with the idea of banning specific types of experimentation, such as outdoor experiments or flight testing.15 A laser can be tested for beam strength and pointing accuracy as a ballistic missile defense device without being identified as an ASAT. A microsat can be tested for maneuverability as a scientific probe, even if its real purpose is different, since maneuvering microsats capable of colliding with other satellites may have no visible features clearly revealing their intended purpose. Bans on outdoor testing of declared ASAT devices would do little to impede their development. Second, more broadly, it is not possible to prevent certain types of weapons designed for ballistic missile defense from being used as ASATs. This is in essence a problem of verification. However, the issue is less of verification per se than of knowing the intent of the country building a given system—and ensuring that its intent never changes. The latter goals are unrealistic. Some systems designed for missile defense have inherent ASAT capabilities and will retain them, due to the laws of physics, regardless of what arms control prohibitions are developed, and countries possessing these systems will recognize their latent capabilities.16 For example, the American midcourse missile defense system and the airborne laser would both have inherent capabilities against low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, if given good information on a satellite's location—easy to obtain—and perhaps some software modifications. The United States could declare for the time being that it will not link these missile defense systems to satellite networks or give them the necessary communications and software capabilities to accept such data. But such restraints, while currently worthwhile as informal, nonbinding measures, are difficult to verify and easy to reverse. Thus, no robust, long-term formal treaty regime should be based on them. Indeed, the problem goes beyond missile defense systems. Even the space shuttle, with its ability to maneuver and approach satellites in low Earth orbit, has inherent ASAT potential. So do any country's nuclear weapons deployed atop ballistic missiles. Explicit testing in ASAT modes can be prohibited, but any prohibition could have limited meaning. Third, it is not clear that the United States will benefit militarily from an ASAT ban forever. The scenario of a war in the Taiwan Strait is a good example of how, someday, the United States could be put at serious risk by another country's satellites.17 That day is not near, and there are many other possible ways to deal with the worry in the near term besides developing destructive ASATs. But over time, a possible need for such a weapon cannot be ruled out.</em><br />

<em><strong>3. satellites cant be used for weapons, and the DOD doesn’t want them</strong></em><br />

<em>When first confronted with the idea of gigawatts of coherent energy being beamed from a spacebased solar power (SBSP) satellite, people immediately ask, “wouldn’t that make a powerful weapon?” Depending on their bias that could either be a good thing: developing a disruptive capability to enhance U.S. power, or a bad thing: proliferating weapons to space. But the NSSO is not interested in spacebased solar power as a weapon. 1. The DoD is not looking to SBSP for new armaments capabilities. Its motivation for studying SBSP is to identify sources of energy at a reasonable cost anywhere in the world, to shorten the logistics lines and huge amount of infrastructure needed to support military combat operations, and to prevent conflicts over energy as current sources become increasingly costly. 2. SBSP does not offer any capability as a weapon that does not already exist in much less expensive options. For example, the nation already has working ICBMs with nuclear warheads should it choose to use them to destroy large enemy targets. 3. SBSP is not suitable for attacking ground targets. The peak intensity of the microwave beam that reaches the ground is less than a quarter of noon-sunlight; a worker could safely walk in the center of the beam. The physics of microwave transmission and deliberate safe-design of the transmitting antenna act to prevent beam focusing above a pre-determined maximum intensity level. Additionally, by coupling the transmitting beam to a unique ground-based pilot signal, the beam can be designed to instantly diffuse should pilot signal lock ever be lost or disrupted. 4. SBSP would not be a precision weapon. Today’s militaries are looking for more precise and lower collateral-damage weapons. At several kilometers across, the beam from geostationary Earth orbit is just too wide to shoot individual targets—even if the intensity were sufficient to cause harm. 5. SBSP is an anti-war capability. America can use the existing technical expertise in its military to catalyze an energy transformation that lessens the likelihood of conflict between great powers over energy scarcity, lessens the need to intervene in failed states which cannot afford required energy, helps the world climb from poverty to prevent the spawn of terrorism, and averts the potential costs and disaster responses from climate change. Solving the long-term energy scarcity problem is too vital to the world’s future to have it derailed by a misconception that space solar power might somehow be used as a weapon. That is why it is so important to educate people about this technology and to continue to conduct the research in an open environment</em><br />

As outlined in Air University study Spacecast 2020, the rapid launch and deployment of satellites is required to comply with the United States National Military Strategy concept of reconstitution. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Reconstitution for space is the ability to launch satellites for “unanticipated system failures … [due to hostile actions] and multiple area coverage requirements, [which] … require the immediate placement of satellites into orbit.</span>” 21 <span style="text-decoration: none;">Solar power satellites enable reconstitution with unmanned aerial vehicles performing the same functions as satellites</span>, as mentioned previously, <span style="text-decoration: none;">and through</span> enabling <span style="text-decoration: none;">smaller satellites. One of the difficulties in achieving small satellites is the fact that power generation takes up about 25% of the weight of a satellite</span>. 22 <span style="text-decoration: none;">Satellites launched without onboard power generation would be smaller and receive power on orbit from a solar power satellite. Solar power satellites enable reconstitution with unmanned aerial vehicles with unlimited loiter time</span> for immediate deployment for a warfighter, <span style="text-decoration: none;">and by reducing the size of satellites which facilitates rapid launches</span>. Small Satellites <span style="text-decoration: none;">Small satellites</span> not only fulfill the reconstitution requirement but <span style="text-decoration: none;">also meet other requirements for smaller, faster, and cheaper</span> satellites. Typically weighing less than 250 kg, and designed for one mission, “quick checkout and rapid launch,” <span style="text-decoration: none;">small satellites offer advantages over larger satellite</span>s, which are more expensive, cost more to put in orbit, and take longer to build. 23 <span style="text-decoration: none;">Small satellites are good candidates for imagery, and</span> some types of <span style="text-decoration: none;">communications</span>. 24 Constellations of small satellites serve another purpose. <span style="text-decoration: none;">They have reduced vulnerability and increased survivability</span> compared to single satellites. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Powering small satellites with energy beamed from a solar power satellite further reduces their size, cost, and launch requirements</span>. Maneuver <span style="text-decoration: none;">One of the vulnerabilities of satellites is that they lack maneuverability</span>. Orbit changes are possible but the amount of station keeping fuel limits these maneuvers. Unscheduled orbital maneuvers for, supported warfighters, on-orbit station keeping, or avoiding an anti-satellite weapon, reduce the life expectancy of satellites. The New World Vistas study concluded, “<span style="text-decoration: none;">technologies to substantially enhance survivability are …maneuvering technologies…enabled by</span> the technologies of high generation power in space.” 25 Moreover, the report stated that <span style="text-decoration: none;">electrical propulsion and solar power satellites</span> would enable maneuvering <span style="text-decoration: none;">for survivability, station keeping, and repositioning to meet warfighter requirements</span>.<br />

<strong>5. No arms race – to costly</strong><br />
<strong>Dolman 06 [</strong>Everett C., Professor of Comparative Military Studies at the US Air Force’s School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS) “A Debate About Weapons in Space: For U.S. Military Transformation and Weapons in Space”, SAIS Review, Winter-Spring, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/sais_review/v026/26.1dolman.html" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/sais_review/v026/26.1dolman.html</a> <em>STRONG]</em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">In such circumstances, America certainly would respond eventually. Conversely, if America were to weaponize space today, it is unlikely that any other state or group of states would find it rational to counter in kind. The entry cost to provide the necessary infrastructure is too high—hundreds of billions of dollars, at minimum. The years of investment needed to achieve a minimal counter-force capability—essentially from scratch—would provide more than ample time for the United States to entrench itself in space and readily counter preliminary efforts to displace it. The tremendous effort in time and resources would be worse than wasted. Most states, if not all, would opt not to counter U.S. deployments in kind. They might oppose U.S. interests with asymmetric balancing, depending on how aggressively America uses its new power, but the likelihood of a hemorrhaging arms race in space should the United States deploy weapons there—at least for the next few years—is extremely remote.</span></em><br />

<em><strong>6. Space mil’s key to deterrence</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Morgan 10</strong> [Forrest E, senior political scientist at the RAND corporation, Ph.D. in policy studies, University of Maryland; M.A.A.S. in airpower arts and sciences, Maxwell Air Force; M.A. in computer systems management, Webster University; B.S. in business management, University of Maryland, “Deterrence and First-Strike Stability in Space A Preliminary Assessment” RAND corporation 2010</em> STRONG]<br />
Deterrence entails discouraging an opponent from committing an act of aggression by manipulating the expectation of resultant costs and beneits. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Deterring attacks on U.S. space systems will require the United States to fashion credible threats of punishment against potential opponents, persuade adversaries that they can be denied</span> the bene-Summary xiii its of their aggression, or some combination of both approaches. However, <span style="text-decoration: none;">fashioning a space deterrence regime that is suiciently potent and credible will be dificult given that U.S. warfighting capabilities</span>, much more so than those of any potential adversary, <span style="text-decoration: none;">depend on space support</span>. Threatening to punish aggressors by destroying their satellites might not deter them from attacking U.S. assets—a game of satellite tit-for-tat would likely work to the adversary’s advantage. Conversely, <span style="text-decoration: none;">threats of punishment in the terrestrial domain may lack credibility in crises and at lower levels of limited war and would likely be irrelevant at higher levels of war, when heavy terrestrial attacks are already under way</span>. Denial strategies face other hurdles. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Efforts to deny adversaries the beneits of space aggression are hindered by the inherent vulnerability of some important U.S. space systems and the high degree of U.S. dependence on those assets</span>. As long as those systems are vulnerable, the enemy’s beneit in attacking space assets is proportionate to the United States’ dependence on the capabilities they provide. (See pp. 24–33.) <span style="text-decoration: none;">While these factors suggest that it may be dificult to deter potential enemies from attacking certain U.S. space systems in some circumstances, the task of strengthening first-strike stability in space is by no means impossible.</span> As illustrated earlier, the orbital infrastructures of some U.S. systems are already suiciently robust that they present poor targets for prospective attackers. he challenge will be to ind ways to raise the thresholds of deterrence failure for those systems that are both vulnerable and important for force enhancement. Meeting this challenge will require the United States to develop and employ a coherent national space deterrence strategy. (See p. 35.)<br />

<em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">At a time when defense budgets are being cut, the era of the multi-billion dollar military satellite program might be over. Witness the fate of the massive $12 billion TSAT program, which was shut down in 2009. As a much cheaper alternative, governments are exploring the possibility of using microsatellites to perform many of the functions currently performed by expensive large satellite systems: GPS navigation, communication, surveillance, and earth imagery. At a 10th of the cost of their larger cousins, microsatellites are much easier sell to budget conscious procurement officers. They are much cheaper and faster to build and launch. For key military missions, however, their reliability and longevity are an issue. They might be cheaper, but if the military has to use 10 times as many to do the job of traditional satellites, would that be a cost savings? This DID Spotlight article will focus on the US military’s microsatellite development and launch programs, as well as the Army’s development of nanosatellites for battlefield communication, and take a brief look at the problem of space debris.</span></em><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Microsatellites are cheaper to make and launch. Smaller launch vehicles can be used to launch multiple microsatellites into orbit, or microsatellites can piggyback on rockets blasting larger payloads into space. In addition to being faster and cheaper, microsatellites can be used for missions that larger satellites can’t perform, such as setting up a constellation of communication nodes or conducting in-orbit inspection of larger satellites. They could even be used as anti-satellite weapons to destroy key satellites of opponents. Some observers have judged that the BX-1 microsatellite deployed by China in 2008 was an experimental anti-satellite weapon. The slogan for the small satellite approach is “faster, better, smaller, cheaper” – a slogan that the Pentagon has embraced with gusto.</span><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The future of microsatellites can be summed up by the slogan with which we began this discussion – “faster, better, smaller, cheaper.” The US military will continue to work on improving each aspect: getting microsatellites into space faster, improving their performance and durability, making components even smaller, and, above else, making them cheaper to build and deploy. One area for future research is the miniaturization of propulsion systems. Propulsion systems for early satellites were bulky and expensive. However, with advances in micro-electromechanical system |PDF] (MEMS) and pulsed plasma thruster technology, small satellites should soon be able to perform just like their larger cousins. The future of microsatellites might look more like DARPA’s System F6, in which constellations of microsatellite components form a network that can perform the tasks of a large satellite. Of course, such a future requires the development of open interface standards to enable the emergence of a such a constellation. However, open interface standards are by definition known to the public. So as military microsatellites progress, the issue of information security is likely to become front and center. At the same time, the attractiveness of small satellites produced cheaply and launched quickly cannot be denied. In the area of satellites, small is beautiful.</span></em><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">However, recent advances in microelectronics has generated a new species of modern, highly sophisticated, computationally powerful, rapid-response micro-satellites (and mini-satellites) that have reduced the cost of a single satellite by more than an order of magnitude. These &quot;faster, cheaper, better&quot; micro-satellites now make the implementation of such a disaster network both practicable and affordable. These modern microsatellites and minisatellites are designed and built within a different philosophy to that used for conventional satellites and offer: • low cost • rapid response • tailored mission &amp; sensors • high operational flexibility (re-programmable) • low operational cost (high autonomy) • direct access (low cost terminals &amp; Internet) • long operational lifetime in orbit (&gt;10 years) The use of small satellites for Earth observation has received considerable attention. As the cost of conventional remote sensing missions continues to escalate, smaller and cheaper satellites are becoming increasingly attractive. While many studies have been devoted to implementing small imaging satellites, most of these designs focus on systems with masses of 300 - 600 kg. Relatively little attention has been paid to the possibilities of employing tiny 50 kg microsatellites for remote sensing. Conversely, SSTL's (Surrey satellite Technology Ltd.) activities in Earth imaging are tightly focused towards implementing useful imaging systems within the constraints of very small satellites. Natural and man-made disasters incur enormous costs every year. Effective and timely monitoring from space is an urgent national requirement in order to be able to react quickly to mitigate the effects of different disasters. ₪ stopped here at 21:00 ₪ Networks of Earth observation satellites have been proposed in order to improve upon the coverage and revisit time of existing systems, however the very high cost of conventional remote sensing satellites. Remote sensing microsatellites are very attractive because of their low cost and fast development schedules, in particular because they make independent or dedicated, as opposed to general-purpose, imaging missions affordable. However, these very small spacecraft present many constraints to the design of imaging payloads that are not experienced on conventional large satellites. Microsatellites have a high mobility due to their compactness and small mass which is essential for observing the following category of events: weather phenomena like hurricanes, lightning or polar lights, spectacular fires, volcano eruptions, floods, earth quakes, ship, plane or railway accidents or any other events of this type which e.g. a news agency would like to present in the news. This interesting area is typically only a few square kilometers large and the resolution requirement is of course as high as possible.</span><br />

<em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Although most of the space missions today uses Mini satellites as the lower end of weight (~250-500 kg), it is our belief that more and more missions will eventually carried out by micro satellites. Advanced propulsion solution, such as combination of solar powered HALL engine will allow future micro satellites to adjust their orbit, maintain height in very low earth orbits and maneuver themselves to desired locations. The variety of missions that can be carried out by micro satellites is very wide. To name a few: • Electro optical remote sensing (visible light, IR, Multi spectral &amp; more) • SAR • Commint • Elint • Designated communication All the applications mentioned are suitable for both MILITARY and CIVILIAN purposes. Already the distinction between military and civilian missions, especially in the remote sensing satellite, is vague. Although the small size and weight of micro satellite is a shortcoming, sometimes it can be mitigated with formation flying of several micro satellites cluster. If correctly put in orbit, the mission could be distributed between the elements of the cluster and the artificial &quot;wide span&quot; may become an advatge.</span></em><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">China carried out similar maneuvers with Surrey technology several years ago. Since in the vacuum of space (as was known to Galileo) a feather and lead shot fall at the same speed without significant drag, a microsatellite with little payload necessary to devote to other tasks can be equipped to outmaneuver and outlast a major satellite, the primary job of which is surveillance, highbandwidth communication, and the like. It is difficult to counter space mines once they are in place. It might be done with defensive microsatellites, but the asymmetric nature of the threat (i.e., tiny expenditures for the microsatellite vs. $200 million-plus for a major US LEO satellite, makes it desirable to prevent the emergence of such threats.</span><br />

<em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Microsatellites show great promise for both quick-response ISR and critical space control missions, such as space situation awareness. For example, the Canadian Space Agency launched a scientific satellite in 2003 weighing about 60 kilograms that can produce space surveillance data comparable to the U.S. space-based surveillance sensor on the 3000 kilogram MSX satellite now operated by DOD. Some U.S. agencies have begun developing quick response microsatellite programs. Perhaps the most significant near-term effort is a program jointly sponsored by the DOD Office of Force Transformation and the Air Force Space Command Office of Transformation and Development. To be launched in early 2004 on a new commercial booster costing less than $6 million per launch, a 100kilogram microsatellite will locate and report electronic emitter data directly to deployed field commanders.</span></em><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The growing threats facing the United States and allies demand new approaches. The threats include the rise of new peer competitors, proliferation of WMD, and non-state, global terrorism. A new set of capabilities is needed that would focus on war prevention. Key among these capabilities are responsive space and information tools. Much of the necessary groundwork for a new approach has been laid. The formation of a new U.S. Strategic Command provides an operational focus for war-prevention operations. The partial separation of space efforts from other capabilities within DOD has been accomplished under the Air Force Space Command and Under Secretary of the Air Force. Key technology developments, particularly in low-cost, rapid access to space, long-range strike, and microsatellites has begun, primarily within defense agencies, such as DARPA. There remains much to do. Organizational inertia within existing warfighting-focused organizations remains an impediment. Public angst over new forms of military conflict and activities such as space weaponry, space control, and Internet operations will need to be considered. New CONOPS and new technologies will need to be developed to enable the responsive space sortie capability. Consequently, it may be time to separate these critical functions into a new Space and Information Corps with sole responsibility for training, organizing and equipping the forces necessary to carry out a crucial piece of 21 st century security.</span><br />

<u>SWF believes</u> <u>that the solution to this problem is the creation of an International Civil Space Situational Awareness system</u>. The goal of this system would be to provide all space actors access to the tools needed for safe and sustainable activity in Earth orbit. The two key tools this system would provide are sensor data and analytical capacity to utilize that data in decision-making processes. The concept of space situational awareness (SSA) is not new - it has been an important part of military space activities for several years. But like many other types of information, there is also a need for SSA in the civil world. <u>The fundamental difference between the international civil SSA system SWF is advocating and that used by the military is in the types of information provided</u>. Civil SSA only needs to focus on the location of an object in Earth orbit and a point of contact for that object, along with information about space weather. The additional military requirements of determining function, intent, and capabilities and limitations are not intended to be part of a civil SSA system. Global sensor coverage The Foundation believes that such a system needs to be international in both its creation and operations, Weeded advised the subcommittee. Accurate tracking of all objects in Earth orbit requires a geographically distributed network of both radar and optical telescopes. &quot;Such a network is very expensive to create and maintain, and only the United States has thus far developed one,&quot; Weeden pointed out. &quot;And <u>while the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tate<u>s' space surveillance network does provide the most complete SSA data in the world,</u> <u>it still has significant limitations due to the lack of coverage</u> <u>in areas where the United States does not have a presence</u>.&quot; In addition to global sensor coverage<u>, an international civil SSA system must also include data from commercial satellite owner-operators: these entities have data on the locations of their satellites more accurate than any ground-based sensor could obtain</u>. &quot;The key to making such a system work is in the data sharing model,&quot; Weeden said. Central clearing house <u>One potential model would have each participant in the system choosing what data they provide to a central clearing house</u>. <u>All participants would have access to all of the shared data in the clearing house, enabling them to do their own independent analysis.</u> <u>All participants</u> <u>would</u> also <u>have access to analytical support from the central data clearing house to offset the lack of indigenous capability.</u> &quot;Many States, working together in a voluntary partnership with commercial partners, could provide the necessary data to all actors,&quot; Weeden said. &quot;<u>This</u> information <u>could not only mitigate future collisions but enhance cooperation</u>, transparency and future space governance issues.&quot; SWF is eager to work with organizations around the world to explore the possibility of an international civil space situational awareness system, along with other options and proposals that will enable safe and secure activities in Earth orbit.<br />

<u>Collecting data is only part of the ultimate long-term solution for orbital debris,</u> <u>which involves mitigating the growth of additional debris and, eventually, cleaning up some of the debris.</u> The biggest hazard, McKnight said, is posed by the biggest objects, which can fragment and create thousands of smaller objects. The National Academies study released last fall stated that <u>future growth of the orbital debris population</u> in LEO <u>could be stopped if five large objects were removed from orbit each year</u>, provided most of the objects launched followed existing guidelines to mitigate the creation of additional debris. There’s been plenty of creative thinking in recent years about how to deal with orbital debris cleanup, from concepts like “bounties” for removing objects to innovative technical approaches, like electrodynamic tethers (see “Putting a bounty on orbital debris”, The Space Review, July 27, 2009). DARPA has shown an interest in this area as well with its recent “Catcher’s Mitt” study, although the agency has issued no updates following a symposium it hosted in late 2009. McKnight suggested a more focused effort than simply deorbiting (or moving to other orbits) all large debris. He instead proposed something called “just in time collision avoidance” to deal with only those objects that pose a clear threat to active satellites. <u>This would require improved SSA capabilities to detect a potential collision</u> well in advance, <u>offering enough advanced warning move one of the objects out of the way. “</u>I believe <u>that may potentially end up being more cost effective and analytically more sound,” than mass removal of large objects</u>, he said. “I think that the technology is probably ahead of the non-technical parts, the legal and policy issues,” when it comes to orbital debris removal, Weeden said. For example, <u>an effort by one country to remove a debris object owned by another country could pose legal problems, since the laws of salvage in the ocean don’t apply to space, where ownership of a satellite or other object remains in place even after the object is no longer in service</u> (see “Protecting Apollo artifacts on the Moon”, The Space Review, November 7, 2011). Weeden added that <u>groundbased lasers could be a cost-effective way to deorbit debris, but their use poses <strong>some obvious policy issues.</strong></u><br />

Because a cost-effective method to remove space debris is needed to effectively address the problem, the required international agreement on space debris must create a way for the space-faring nations to fund further scientific research. <u>Some nations may express concern that such a plan is not in their economic interest.</u> Dealing with the problem now, however, would ultimately be less costly and less difficult than waiting until the cascade effect occurs. Moreover, as the amount of space debris increases, the economic barrier to space exploration also increases. Spacecraft will need thicker shielding, “making them heavier and more costly.”326 At some point, it could become too expensive to use and explore space unless the international community effectively deals with the removal of space debris.327 <u>To help pay for a cost-effective method of space debris removal, an international treaty must impose upon all space-faring nations the responsibility, upon ratification or accession, to contribute money to an international fund. An international organization</u>, <strong><u>created in the treaty and directed by COPUOS</u></strong>, <u>would maintain that fund and be solely responsible for the collection and distribution of the revenues</u>. <u>Monies collected would be redistributed into a research and development process</u>, subsequently <strong><u>aiding in actual mitigation and removal activities</u></strong>. <u>The state contribution amount should be based on market-share responsibility for the debris currently in orbit</u>. By forcing Similar proposals have been made before.328 contributions based on each nation’s contribution to the space debris problem, market-share contributions provide the only fair and effective solution to the space debris problem.329 Similarly, <u>for any hostile attack in space</u>,330 <u>the aggressive nation would be required to pay the cost of debris removal. If two objects collide</u>, akin to the February 2009 satellite collision, the <u>parties</u> <u>involved</u> would be jointly and severally liable to <u>pay</u> for the <u>clean up</u> if fault cannot be established. <u>This solution to the problem would place the greatest financial obligation on the nations that have created, and continue to create, the most space debris</u>. Moreover, <strong><u>every future space launch should include an additional fee that will be sent to the space debris removal and mitigation fund</u></strong>. “Although initially this would increase the cost of space access, which no one wants, it would be preferable to having no space access should an orbit become unusable.”331<br />

<em><u>Option 3 is for the US government to allow</u>, <u>and</u> preferably <u>support</u>, <u>the creation of an international civil space situational awareness system. This system would have the goal of providing the basic tools necessary to enable conjunction assessment and collision avoidance by all space actors. These tools include positional data on objects in orbit, space weather data, atmospheric density, and the analytical tools to make decisions based on this data.</u> It would also involve contributions of data on precise positions and possibly future maneuvers by commercial owner-operators. Such a civil system would different from military SSA in that it would not provide characterization information on the satellites nor information on capabilities and intent. It would be focused only on providing the location of objects in space, along with a point of contact for that object, and space weather data. Also, <u>it is not necessary for governments to reveal the locations of their sensitive military and intelligence satellites in such a system.</u> However, hiding the location of these satellites implies that their respective governments have accepted responsibility for keeping those satellites from colliding with others. And <strong><u>there is incentive for governments to do this: allowing your “invisible” satellite to collide with another object defeats the purpose of such a critical asset in the first place</u></strong>. <u>The key to such an international civil SSA system is the data sharing model.</u> While a completely open system where data is available to everyone around the world might be the ideal, failing to give consideration to the sensitivities of such data would probably doom such a system before it even got started. Any data sharing model for this purpose needs to appropriately balance security and privacy with data dissemination and openness. To encourage participation from the essential actors in the beginning, it would probably be necessary to start with a more restrictive data sharing model than what might be possible in the later stages once participants become comfortable with the system and each other. <u>The</u> primary <u>incentives for such a system are twofold</u>. First, <u>since the problem of maintaining space situational awareness fundamentally requires a geographically distributed network of sensors</u>, many <u>states contributing data from a few of their own sensors can provide global coverage for much less cost than one state trying to build an entire network alone</u>. Second, <u>such a system would provide both the data and analytical tools to all space actors, not just those with the resources to build their own tracking networks.</u> This last point is perhaps the most important justification for such a system. The collision on February 10 was between satellites from the two nations with the best tracking networks and satellite catalogs in the world. <u>There are now 40 different nations operating satellites in Earth orbit and many of those have zero indigenous SSA capability. The problem we should be trying to solve is not how to keep a co-orbital anti-satellite weapon from destroying a US military satellite in Earth orbit. Rather, it’s how to prevent an Iranian satellite from colliding from German satellite, which maneuvered to avoid a piece of Chinese debris</u>, thus creating a piece of debris which collides with a US military satellite. The <u>latter is a far more likely scenario, and has much more significant consequences for all actors in space.</u></em><br />

<em><u>The most prominent issue surrounding cleanup of</u> orbital space <u>debris rests with the fact that under international space law, space objects such as nonfunctioning satellites still belong to the country or countries that launched them. Even though a satellite may not be functioning, this does not mean that it has been abandoned,</u> and <u>without consent from the owner</u>, <strong><u>it cannot be disposed of or otherwise interfered with</u></strong>. This is further complicated by the fact that inter<u>national space law deems fragments and components from space objects as individual space objects in and of themselves, which would require identification to determine the owner and either individual or blanket consent to remove it from orbit.</u> Ancillary to ownership are issues dealing with licensing and compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Methodologies to de-orbit intact derelict satellites may include the use of mechanisms that will rendezvous, attach and physically move the derelict from a stable orbit to either a graveyard orbit where it will not interfere with other space objects or into a less stable orbit that would ensure the destruction of the derelict within a short period of time. This methodology of space debris removal requires an intimate knowledge of the spacecraft so that an effort to de-orbit it would not result in fragmentation and the creation of additional space debris. Disclosure of sufficient technical details regarding the derelict spacecraft would implicate intellectual property, including confidential and proprietary technical information as well as patents. Licensing agreements between the owners and former operators of the derelict satellites would have to be negotiated, as would confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to protect the rights of the owners. Furthermore, <u>ITAR issues could arise if a derelict satellite registered to the United States is slated for removal by a methodology operated by a foreign government</u>, especially <u>if exporting of spacecraft-related technical data outside the United States is involved</u>. <u>Before such exporting and subsequent satellite disposal could take place, licenses or other waivers would be required to address issues that might arise from ITAR.</u></em><br />

NASA-funded <u>researchers</u> <u>are proposing</u> to clean up Earth's orbital environment by using a <u>ground-based laser to &quot;nudge the debris off course</u>,&quot; as Nature News reports. <u>The proposal is still very much at the concept stage, but some experts are already expressing concern that such &quot;space broom&quot; systems could double as space weapons</u>. &quot;Scientists at NASA have considered using a ground-based laser to mitigate debris collisions before. However, <u>in their 'laser broom' concept, a</u> powerful, megawatt-class <u>laser would vaporize the surface of a piece of debris</u> that is heading for another, causing the debris to recoil out of harm's way. But critics argued that <u>the laser could be used as a weapon</u>, <u>as it could easily damage an enemy's active satellites</u>. Indeed, <u>both the United States and China have in the past 15 years been accused of testing the ability of ground-based lasers to 'dazzle' satellites and render them inoperable.</u> &quot;Now, James Mason, a NASA contractor at the Universities Space Research Association in Moffett Field, California, and his colleagues have come up with a variation on the laser broom concept that they claim is unlikely to be useful as a weapon. In a paper ... Mason and colleagues suggest using a medium-powered laser of 5–10 kilowatts to illuminate debris with light a few times more intense than sunlight, imparting just enough momentum to nudge the debris off course. 'We think this scheme is potentially one of the least-threatening ways to solve a problem that has to be addressed,' says Mason.&quot; Space debris experts were quick to point out problems with the concept. &quot;All the experts in space debris contacted by Nature said that the new proposal is feasible, but still has problems. 'It'll be ineffective against dense objects that are too heavy to move, ' says William Priedhorsky of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. 'To use a medical analogy, they propose not to cure the disease, but to manage it.' &quot;And some are concerned that <strong><u>the laser could still be used to push enemy satellites out of orbit.</u></strong> Christophe <u>Bonnal</u>, a debris expert at the French space agency CNES, <u>doesn't buy the researchers' claim that the laser's power would be too low for anti-satellite uses</u>. <u>'Let's be logical</u>,' he says. <u>'If the power is low, <strong>you'll have no effect on the debris</strong>.</u>' But Hugh Lewis, an engineer at the Southampton University, U.K., 'cautiously' welcomes the idea. 'Any method that aims to address the growing debris problem should be taken seriously, I think,' he says.<br />

<em>What is NASA's future now that Atlantis has landed and the shuttle program is over? If NASA persists in using nuclear power in space, the agency's future is threatened. Between November 25 and December 15 NASA plans to launch for use on Mars a rover fueled with 10.6 pounds of plutonium, more plutonium than ever used on a rover. The mission has a huge cost: $2.5 billion. But if there is an accident before the rover is well on its way to Mars, and plutonium is released on Earth, its cost stands to be yet more gargantuan. NASA's Final Environmental Impact Statement for what it calls its Mars Science Laboratory Mission says that if plutonium is released on Earth, the cost could be as high as $1.5 billion to decontaminate each square mile of &quot;mixed-use urban areas&quot; impacted. What&quot;s the probability of an accident releasing plutonium? The NASA document says &quot;the probability of an accident with a release of plutonium&quot; is 1-in-220 &quot;overall.&quot; If you knew your chance of not surviving an airplane flight--or just a drive in a car--was 1 in 220, would you take that trip? And is this enormous risk necessary? In two weeks, there'll be a NASA mission demonstrating a clear alternative to atomic energy in space: solar power. On August 5, NASA plans to launch a solar-powered space probe it's named Juno to Jupiter. There's no atomic energy involved, although NASA for decades has insisted that nuclear power is necessary for space devices beyond the orbit of Mars. With Juno, NASA will be showing it had that wrong. &quot;Juno will provide answers to critical science questions about Jupiter, as well as key information that will dramatically enhance present theories about the early formation of our own solar system,&quot; says NASA on its website. &quot;In 2016, the spinning, solar-powered Juno spacecraft will reach Jupiter.&quot; It will be equipped with &quot;instruments that can sense the hidden world beneath Jupiter's colorful clouds&quot; and make 33 passes of Jupiter. As notes Aviation Week and Space Technology: &quot;The unique spacecraft will set a record by running on solar power rather than nuclear radioisotope thermoelectric generators previously used to operate spacecraft that far from the Sun.&quot; The Mars rover to be launched, named Curiosity by NASA, will be equipped with these radioisotope thermoelectric generators using plutonium, the deadliest radioactive substance. Juno, a large craft--66-feet wide--will be powered by solar panels built by a Boeing subsidiary, Spectrolab. The panels can convert 28 percent of the sunlight that them to electricity. They'll also produce heat to keep Juno's instruments warm. This mission's cost is $1.1 billion. In fact, Juno is not a wholly unique spacecraft. In 2004, the European Space Agency launched a space probe called Rosetta that is also solar-powered. Its mission is to orbit and land on a comet--beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Moreover, there have been major developments in &quot;solar sails&quot; to propel spacecraft. Last year, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency launched its Ikaros spacecraft with solar sails taking it to Venus. In January, NASA itself launched its NanoSail-D spacecraft. The Planetary Society has been developing several spacecraft that will take advantage of photons emitted by the Sun to travel through the vacuum of space. At no point will Juno (or the other solar spacecrafts) be a threat to life on Earth. This includes Juno posing no danger when in 2013 it makes a flyby of Earth. Such flybys making use of Earth's gravity to increase a spacecraft's velocity have constituted dangerous maneuvers when in recent years they've involved plutonium-powered space probes such as NASA's Galileo and Cassini probes. Curiosity is a return to nuclear danger. NASA's Final Environmental Impact statement admits that a large swath of Earth could be impacted by plutonium in an accident involving it. The document's section on &quot;Impacts of Radiological Releases&quot; says &quot;the affected environment&quot; could include &quot;the regional area near the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the global area.&quot; &quot;Launch area accidents would initially release material into the regional area, defined&quot;to be within &quot;62 miles of the launch pad,&quot; says the document. This is an area from Cape Canaveral west to Orlando. But &quot;since some of the accidents result in the release of very fine particles less than a micron in diameter, a portion of such releases could be transported beyond&quot;62 miles,&quot; it goes on. These particles could become &quot;well-mixed in the troposphere&quot;--the atmosphere five to nine miles high--&quot;and have been assumed to potentially affect persons living within a latitude band from approximately 23-degrees north to 30-degrees north.&quot; That's a swath through the Caribbean, across North Africa and the Mideast, then India and China Hawaii and other Pacific islands, and Mexico and southern Texas. Then, as the rocket carrying Curiosity up gains altitude, the impacts of an accident in which plutonium is released would be even broader. The plutonium could affect people &quot;anywhere between 28-degrees north and 28-degrees south latitude,&quot; says the NASA document. That's a band around the mid-section of the Earth including much of South America, Africa and Australia. Dr. Helen Caldicott, president emeritus of Physicians for Social Responsibility, has long emphasized that a pound of plutonium if uniformly distributed could hypothetically give a fatal dose of lung cancer to every person on Earth. A pound, even 10.6 pounds, could never be that uniformly distributed, of course. But an accident in which plutonium is released by a space device as tiny particles falling to Earth maximizes its lethality. A millionth of a gram of plutonium can be a fatal dose. The pathway of greatest concern is the breathing in plutonium particle.. As the NASA Environmental Impact Statement puts it: &quot;Particles smaller than about 5 microns would be transported to and remain in the trachea, bronchi, or deep lung regions.&quot; The plutonium particles &quot;would continuously irradiate lung tissue.&quot; &quot;A small fraction would be transported over time directly to the blood or to lymph nodes and then to the blood,&quot; it continues. Once plutonium &quot;has entered the blood via ingestion or inhalation, it would circulate and be deposited primarily in the liver and skeletal system.&quot; Also, says the document, some of the plutonium would migrate to the testes or ovaries. The cost of decontamination of areas affected by the plutonium could be, according to the NASA statement, $267 million for each square mile of farmland, $478 million for each square mile of forests and $1.5 billion for each square mile of &quot;mixed-use urban areas.&quot; The NASA document lists &quot;secondary social costs associated with the decontamination and mitigation activities&quot; as: &quot;Temporary or longer term relocation of residents; temporary or longer term loss of employment; destruction or quarantine of agricultural products including citrus crops; land use restrictions which could affect real estate values, tourism and recreational activities; restriction or bands on commercial fishing; and public health effects and medical care.&quot; As to why the use of a plutonium-powered rover on Mars--considering that NASA has successfully used solar-powered rovers on Mars--the NASA Environmental Impact Statement says that a &quot;solar-powered rover&quot;would not be capable of operating over the full range of scientifically desirable landing site latitudes&quot; on this mission. There's more to it. For many decades there has been a marriage of nuclear power and space at NASA. The use of nuclear power on space missions has been heavily promoted by the U.S. Department of Energy and its predecessor agency, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, and the many DOE (previously AEC) national laboratories including Los Alamos and Oak Ridge. This provides work for these government entities. Also, the manufacturers of nuclear-powered space devices--General Electric was a pioneer in this--have pushed their products. Further, NASA has sought to coordinate its activities with the U.S. military. The military for decades has planned for the deployment of nuclear-powered weapons in space. Personifying the NASA-military connection now is NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, a former NASA astronaut and Marine Corps major general. Appointed by President Barack Obama, he is a booster of radioisotope thermoelectric generators as well as rockets using nuclear power for propulsion. The U.S. has spent billions of dollars through the years on such rockets but none have ever taken off and the programs have all ended up cancelled largely out of concern about a nuclear-powered rocket blowing up on launch or falling back to Earth. Accidents have happened in the U.S. space nuclear program. Of the 26 space missions that have used plutonium which are listed in the NASA Environmental Impact Statement for the Mars Science Laboratory Mission, three underwent accident, admits the document. The worst occurred in 1964 and involved, it notes, the SNAP-9A plutonium system aboard a satellite that failed to achieve orbit and dropped to Earth, disintegrating as it fell. The 2.1 pounds of plutonium fuel dispersed widely over the Earth and Dr. John Gofman, professor of medical physics at the University of California at Berkeley, long linked this accident to an increase in global lung cancer. With the SNAP-9A accident, NASA switched to solar energy on satellites. Now all satellites--and the International Space Station--are solar-powered. There was a near-miss involving a nuclear disaster and a space shuttle. The ill-fated Challenger's next mission in 1986 was to loft a plutonium-powered space probe. The NASA Environmental Impact Statement includes comments from people and organizations some highly critical of a plutonium-powered Mars Science Laboratory Mission. Leah Karpen of Asheville, North Carolina says: &quot;Every expansion of plutonium research, development and transportation of this deadly material increases the risk of nuclear accident or theft. In addition, plutonium production is expensive and diverts resources from the more important social needs of our society today, and in the future.&quot; She urges NASA &quot;to reconsider the use of nuclear&quot; and go with solar instead. Jeremy Maxand, executive director of the Idaho-based Snake River Alliance, calls on NASA and the Department of Energy to &quot;take this opportunity to move space exploration in a sustainable direction with regard to power. Using solar rather than nuclear to power the Mars Science Laboratory Mission would keep the U.S. safe, advance energy technologies that are cleaner and more secure, be more fiscally responsible, and set a responsible example to other countries as they make decisions about their energy future.&quot; Ace Hoffman of Carlsbad, California speaks of &quot;today's nuclear NASA&quot; and a &quot;closed society of dangerous, closed-minded &quot;scientists' who are hoodwinking the American public and who are guilty of premeditated random murder.&quot; He adds: &quot;The media has a duty to learn the truth rather than parrot NASA's blanketly-false assertions.&quot; NASA, in response to the criticisms, repeatedly states in the document: &quot;NASA and the DOE take very seriously the possibility that an action they take could potentially result in harm to humans or the environment. Therefore, both agencies maintain vigorous processes to reduce the potential for such events.&quot; Involved in challenging the mission is the Global Network Against Weapons &amp; Nuclear Power in Space (www.space4peace.org). Bruce Gagnon, coordinator of the Maine-based organization, says that &quot; NASA sadly appears committed to maintaining their dangerous alliance with the nuclear industry. Both entities view space as a new market for the deadly plutonium fuel.&quot; Says Gagnon: &quot;The taxpayers are being asked once again to pay for nuclear missions that could endanger the life of all the people on the planet &quot;Have we not learned anything from Chernobyl and Fukushima? We don't need to be launching nukes into space. It's not a gamble we can afford to take.&quot; With the return of Atlantis and end of the shuttle program, there are concerns about this being the &quot;end&quot; of the U.S. space program. An accident if NASA continues to insist on mixing atomic energy and space--a nuclear disaster overhead--that, indeed, could end the space program.</em><br />

The Space Economy Symposium, an initiative of George Mason University in collaboration with Phillips and Company and hosted by the Space Enterprise Council of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, provided a forum for a robust discussion on the contributions of space to the nation's economic growth and the role of space in enabling greater national competitiveness in a global economy. &quot;Keeping NASA funded at its highest levels is paramount to the success of America, creating jobs for our struggling economy and keeping us on the frontline of space exploration,&quot; said Congressman Parker Griffith (D-AL) in his keynote remarks. &quot;A well-funded space program is one of the many things that can help provide a needed jump start to our struggling economy,&quot; said Griffith, a member of the Science and Technology Committee and the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics in the U.S. House of Representatives. His district includes Huntsville, AL, the home of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Two panels of experts presented recent research and analysis of the space economy and discussed its effect on the broader economy including areas such as the environment, energy, communications, and technology development. They also discussed new space infrastructure development, including communications, earth observations, launch systems and commercial exploration and what these new systems and infrastructure will mean in terms of benefiting Earth and enabling more affordable utilization and exploration of space. Among the research presented was a study introduced at the symposium by the international consulting firm Oxford Analytica. Entitled &quot;Understanding the Space Economy,&quot; the study predicts the space industry will reach more than $1 trillion by 2020. The study finds that space is a critically important contributor to the global economy: &quot;Remove the space dimension and the world would lose much of the growth that it has experienced in the last 50 years.&quot; Barrie Stevens, Deputy Director, International Futures Program at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) discussed the OECD report &quot;The Space Economy at a Glance,&quot; a &quot;first ever statistical overview of the emerging space economy.&quot; The study finds that &quot;over coming decades, space-related applications, such as distance education, telemedicine, precision farming, land-use management, and monitoring of various international treaties, will continue to hold great socioeconomic promise.&quot;<br />

What do these trends mean in the short and medium term? The Great Depression showed how social and global chaos followed hard on economic collapse. The mere fact that parliaments across the globe, from America to Japan, are unable to make responsible, economically sound recovery plans suggests that they do not know what to do and are simply hoping for the least disruption. Equally worrisome is the adoption of more statist economic programs around the globe, and the concurrent decline of trust in free-market systems. The threat of instability is a pressing concern. China, until last year the world's fastest growing economy, just reported that 20 million migrant laborers lost their jobs. Even in the flush times of recent years, China faced upward of 70,000 labor uprisings a year. A sustained downturn poses grave and possibly immediate threats to Chinese internal stability. The regime in Beijing may be faced with a choice of repressing its own people or diverting their energies outward, leading to conflict with China's neighbors. Russia, an oil state completely dependent on energy sales, has had to put down riots in its Far East as well as in downtown Moscow. Vladimir Putin's rule has been predicated on squeezing civil liberties while providing economic largesse. If that devil's bargain falls apart, then wide-scale repression inside Russia, along with a continuing threatening posture toward Russia's neighbors, is likely. Even apparently stable societies face increasing risk and the threat of internal or possibly external conflict. As Japan's exports have plummeted by nearly 50%, one-third of the country's prefectures have passed emergency economic stabilization plans. Hundreds of thousands of temporary employees hired during the first part of this decade are being laid off. Spain's unemployment rate is expected to climb to nearly 20% by the end of 2010; Spanish unions are already protesting the lack of jobs, and the specter of violence, as occurred in the 1980s, is haunting the country. Meanwhile, in Greece, workers have already taken to the streets. Europe as a whole will face dangerously increasing tensions between native citizens and immigrants, largely from poorer Muslim nations, who have increased the labor pool in the past several decades. Spain has absorbed five million immigrants since 1999, while nearly 9% of Germany's residents have foreign citizenship, including almost 2 million Turks. The xenophobic labor strikes in the U.K. do not bode well for the rest of Europe. A prolonged global downturn, let alone a collapse, would dramatically raise tensions inside these countries. Couple that with possible protectionist legislation in the United States, unresolved ethnic and territorial disputes in all regions of the globe and a loss of confidence that world leaders actually know what they are doing. The result may be a series of small explosions that coalesce into a big bang.<br />

<em>After a 30-year shutdown of plans for the nuclear rocket, the Bush administration has resuscitated the technology by giving NASA nearly $1 billion to expand space nuclear and propulsion research and development. “We are still doing exploration of our solar system in covered wagons,” says Ed Weiler, NASA’s Space Science Chief. “The Nuclear Systems Initiative will open up the railroad.” Included in NASA plans are the nuclear rocket to Mars; a new generation of Radioisotope Thermo-electric Generators (RTGs) for interplanetary missions; nuclear-powered robotic Mars rovers to be launched in 2003 and 2009; and the nuclear powered mission called Pluto-Kuiper Belt scheduled for January, 2006. NASA envisions mining colonies on the Moon (for helium 3 and water), Mars (magnesium, cobalt, and uranium) and asteroids (gold) powered by nuclear reactors launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on rockets with a historic 10% failure rate. By exponentially increasing the number of nuclear launches NASA also exponentially increases the chances of accident. During the 1950s and 1960s NASA spent over $10 billion to build the nuclear rocket program canceled in the end because a launch accident would contaminate major portions of Florida and beyond. By exponentially increasing the number of nuclear launches NASA also exponentially increases the chances of accident. NASA’s expanded focus on nuclear power in space “is not only dangerous but politically unwise,” says Dr. Michio Kaku, professor of nuclear physics at the City University of New York. “The only thing that can kill the US space program is a nuclear disaster…a Chernobyl in the sky.” “NASA hasn’t learned its lesson from its history,” says Kaku, “and a hallmark of science is that you learn from previous mistakes. NASA doggedly pursues its fantasy of nuclear power in space.” Since the 1960s there have been eight space nuclear power accidents by the US and the former Soviet Union, several of which released deadly plutonium. In April, 1964 a US military satellite with 2.1 pounds of plutonium-238 on board fell back to Earth and burned up as it hit the atmosphere, spreading the toxic plutonium globally as dust to be ingested by the people of the planet. In 1997 NASA launched the Cassini space probe carrying 72 pounds of plutonium that fortunately did not experience failure. Hundreds of thousands of people could have been contaminated. Last year the Department of Energy (DoE) and NASA announced that present facilities must be expanded. The DoE will spend over $35 million to renovate the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee to help with space plutonium production. Oak Ridge workers would purify the plutonium, which then would be shipped to Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico where it would be formed into pellets used in space power systems. Historically DoE has a bad track record when it comes to protecting workers and local water systems from radioactive contaminants. Serious questions need to be asked: How will workers be protected? Where will they test the nuclear rocket? How much will it cost? What would be the impacts of a launch accident? Critics of NASA have long stated that the NASA space nukes initiative represents the Bush administration’s covert move to develop power systems for space-based weapons. The military has often stated that their planned lasers in space will require enormous power projection capability and nuclear reactors in orbit would provide such power. In April, 1964 a US military satellite with 2.1 pounds of plutonium-238 on board fell back to Earth and burned up as it hit the atmosphere… “You can’t differentiate between…military application and those capabilities which are civil and commercial in nature.” The Global Network Against Weapons &amp; Nuclear Power in Space maintains that missile defense is a Trojan horse for the Pentagon’s control and domination of space, and NASA’s nuclear rocket is a Trojan horse for the militarization of space. NASA’s new chief, former Navy Secretary Sean O’Keefe said, “I think it’s imperative we have a more direct association between the Defense Department and NASA. … You can’t differentiate between…military application and those capabilities which are civil and commercial in nature.” In the end hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars will be wasted on plans for the nuclearization and weaponization of space. In order to fund these missions Bush and Congress will cut programs like social security, education, health care, child care, public transit and environmental protection. The lives of future generations will become more insecure. For the third year in a row the Global Network (GN) will organize two days of protests on February 3–4, 2003 in Albuquerque, N.M. at the 20th Annual Symposium on Space Nuclear Power &amp; Propulsion. This event draws the top players from NASA, DoE, DoD, nuclear academia and nuclear aerospace each year to plan the push of nuclear power into space. Hundreds of middle and high school students are brought to the symposium for indoctrination and the GN has been able to speak to many of these young people at our protests. NASA, DoE, and the Pentagon are not asking the public if we want to suffer the risk and costs of nuclear power in space. Their corporate and military interests make it necessary to push ahead without public debate. Their plans threaten the life of the entire planetary ecosystem. The time has come for vigorous organizing around the space nuclear power issue.</em><br />

The United States is proceeding rapidly with the nuclearization of space, and the threat we face from Galileo is the kind of danger we will be undergoing constantly if we allow the government to continue to send nuclear hardware into space. If we tolerate Chernobyls in the sky, deadly accidents will be inevitable. Yet this risk is unnecessary. The potential catastrophes are avoidable. After Galileo was launched in 1989, I received, under the Freedom of Information Act, NASA-funded studies declaring that nuclear power was not necessary to generate electricity on the Galileo mission; solar energy would do. The plutonium on board Galileo is being used not for propulsion but as fuel in generators providing a mere 560 watts of electricity for the probe's instruments -Ä electricity that could be produced instead by solar energy. A decade ago NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory concluded: &quot;A Galileo Jupiter-orbiting mission could be performed with a concentrated photovoltaic solar array [panels converting sunlight to electricity] power source without changing the mission sequence or impacting science objectives.&quot; Five years ago, another JPL study said that it would take only two to three years to build the alternative solar-power source. Still another JPL report stressed that using the sun for power would cost less than using plutonium. It is humanity's destiny to explore the heavens, but what a folly it will be if in doing this, we needlessly cause the deaths of tens of thousands of people and contaminate the Earth with deadly plutonium. The federal government and its national laboratories, zealous about nuclear power of all sorts, are pushing nuclear technology in space. So are space contractors such as General Electric, which produces nuclear space devices (including those on Galileo) and is having a hard time peddling nuclear power for use on Earth.<br />
And—Launch and orbit failures could easily send waste packages back to Earth.<br />

Extraterrestrial disposal is conceptually straightforward—the waste material is simply given a one-way ride into outer space. Realistically, however, this option is not feasible due to scientific, technical, and economic factors. These include the energy required to boost payloads into space, the failure of launches and their consequences, and the tradeoffs between cost and safety (Rice and Priest, 1981). Extraterrestrial disposal of HLW would require transport via spacecraft, with extreme attention to safety to avoid release of radioactive materials in the event of malfunction. Placing the waste in space near earth would not be sufficient. Orbits either around earth or around the sun in the inner solar system change over time periods that are short compared to the lifetime of waste components, so that a waste package placed in such orbits conceivably could return to earth. Most discussion of extraterrestrial disposal has therefore involved sending the HLW into the sun, which requires considerably more energy per pound than placing a payload into orbit, that is, larger rockets, and consequently, extremely high cost per pound of waste disposed. Although a technological approach has been described (Taylor, 1995), the formidable energy requirements for solar disposal imply that only the most dangerous waste components might warrant such expensive disposal. Accordingly, reprocessing or separation would be required, as in the case for P&amp;T.<br />

Presumably your goal is to reduce risk to earthlings. If you have a fallible space transportation system, and you are trying to launch something into the Sun (or to Solar System escape) your transport may fail at the wrong time. If it does, it may leave your nuclear waste in an elliptical orbit that intersects the Earth. This isn't so bad, as you probably designed your waste container to survive reasonable re-entry velocities (in case of launch failure). But if the orbit intersects another planet, the waste may be perturbed into an orbit that intersects the Earth at high velocity, up to twice the Earth's velocity around the Sun. This becomes a very difficult container design problem. <br />

And then there's the risk involved in space dumping. Putting radioactive waste into a heliocentric orbit would only reduce, not eliminate, the risks of putting it into a geocentric orbit. Even though the waste containers would be farther away, radioactive particles released from collisions with meteors could still make their way back to earth. Worse, a failure of the Orbital Transfer System could result in the entire waste package returning to earth, burning up on re-entry, and releasing its radioactive contents into the atmosphere. A launch failure would bring the waste plummeting back to earth, and, according to the Battelle study, even that 58,800 pounds of packaging might not withstand such a fall if the payload should happen to land on hard rock. It might also land in the ocean, where, if recovery attempts should fail, it would eventually corrode, releasing all its radioactive wastes. The Battelle report also lists several other possible accidents which could result in a release of radioactive waste. And, of course, the more waste disposed in space, the greater the risk of an accident with serious consequences. There are no science-fiction style rescue missions on the way to save the people of earth from their follies and indulgences. On the contrary, the fact that the U.S. government has turned to investigating space disposal schemes indicates how desperate the radioactive waste problem has become.<br />

Space disposal has emerged as an option, but not as a very viable one. Specifically, space disposal centers around putting nuclear waste on a space shuttle and launching the shuttle into space. This becomes a problem from both a practicality and economic standpoint as the amount of nuclear waste that could be shipped on a single shuttle would be extremely small compared to the total amount of waste that would need to be dealt with. Furthermore, the possibility of the shuttle exploding en route to space could only make the matter worse as such an explosion would only cause the nuclear waste to spread out far beyond any reasonable measure of control. The upside would center around the fact that launching the material into space would subvert any of the other issues associated with the other disposal methods as the decay of the material would occur outside of our atmosphere regardless of the half-life.

<em>The record of nuclear power in space is poor. The United States has launched 24 nuclear-fueled space devices, including a navigational satellite with plutonium aboard that disintegrated in the atmosphere as it plunged to Earth in 1964. The U.S. failure rate for nuclear-powered space devices has been about 15 percent. The Soviet Union has the same failure rate. The Soviets have sent up more than 30 nuclear-fueled devices, including the Kosmos 954, which littered a broad swath of Canada with radioactive debris when it crashed in 1978. The United States spent some $2 billion of taxpayer money on developing nuclear-powered rockets from 1955 to 1973, but none ever got off the ground. That effort was finally canceled because of the concern that a rocket might crash to Earth. Now we're turning to nuclear power in space -- with its inevitable mishaps -- again. Last year the United States launched the Ulysses plutonium-fueled probe to survey the sun. A December Associated Press dispatch noted, &quot;The Ulysses spacecraft is wobbling like an off-balance washing machine, threatening to cripple the $760-million mission.&quot; Fortunately, the probe is not coming back for an Earth flyby.</em><br />

What is NASA’s future now that Atlantis has landed and the shuttle program is over? If NASA persists in using nuclear power in space, the agency’s future is threatened. Between November 25 and December 15 NASA plans to launch for use on Mars a rover fueled with 10.6 pounds of plutonium, more plutonium than ever used on a rover. The mission has a huge cost: $2.5 billion. But if there is an accident before the rover is well on its way to Mars, and plutonium is released on Earth, its cost stands to be yet more gargantuan. NASA’s Final Environmental Impact Statement for what it calls its Mars Science Laboratory Mission says that if plutonium is released on Earth, the cost could be as high as $1.5 billion to decontaminate each square mile of “mixed-use urban areas” impacted.<br />

And, Nuclear terrorism and rogue proliferation are inevitable absent International Cooperation. Only the Counterplan can check the acquisition and use of these weapons.<br />
Allison, Professor of Government and Director of the Belfer Center at Kennedy School of Government, 2K4 (Graham, “How to Stop Nuclear Terror”, Foreign Affairs, January/February)<br />
Denying terrorists access to nuclear weapons and weapons-grade material is thus a challenge to nations' willpower and determination, not to their technical capabilities. Keeping these items safe will be a mammoth undertaking. But the strategy for doing so is clear. The solution would be to apply a new doctrine of &quot;Three No's&quot;: no loose nukes, no new nascent nukes, and no new nuclear states. GETTING A GRIP A few numbers starkly illustrate the scale of the problem the United States now faces in trying to control the spread of nuclear weapons materials. Just eight countries -- China, France, India, Israel, Pakistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States -- are known to have nuclear weapons. In addition, the CIA estimates that North Korea has enough plutonium for one or two nuclear weapons. And two dozen additional states possess research reactors with enough highly enriched uranium (heu) to build at least one nuclear bomb on their own. According to best estimates, the global nuclear inventory includes more than 30,000 nuclear weapons, and enough heu and plutonium for 240,000 more. Hundreds of these weapons are currently stored in conditions that leave them vulnerable to theft by determined criminals, who could then sell them to terrorists. Even more &quot;nascent nukes&quot; (the heu and plutonium that are the only critical ingredients for making nuclear bombs) are at risk. Almost every month, someone somewhere is apprehended trying to smuggle or steal nuclear materials or weapons. Last August, for example, Alexander Tyulyakov -- the deputy director of Atomflot (the organization that carries out repair work for Russian nuclear icebreakers and nuclear submarines) -- was arrested in Murmansk for trying to do just that. The situation is so bad that three years ago, Howard Baker, the current U.S. ambassador to Japan and the former Republican leader of the Senate, testified, &quot;It really boggles my mind that there could be 40,000 nuclear weapons, or maybe 80,000 in the former Soviet Union, poorly controlled and poorly stored, and that the world is not in a near-state of hysteria about the danger.&quot; In making his case against Saddam Hussein, President Bush argued, &quot;If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of uranium a little bigger than a softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year.&quot; What the president failed to mention is that with the same quantity of heu, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, or Hamas could do the same. Once built, nuclear weapons could be smuggled across U.S. borders with little difficulty. Of the seven million cargo containers that will arrive at U.S. ports this year, for example, only two percent will be opened for inspection. And once on U.S. soil, those weapons would likely be used. Prior to September 11, 2001, many experts argued that terrorists were unlikely to kill large numbers of people, because they sought not to maximize victims but to win publicity and sympathy for their causes. After the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, however, few would disagree with President Bush's warning that if al Qaeda gets nuclear weapons, it will use them against the United States &quot;in a heartbeat.&quot; Indeed, Osama bin Laden's press spokesman, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, has announced that the group aspires &quot;to kill 4 million Americans, including 1 million children,&quot; in response to casualties supposedly inflicted on Muslims by the United States and Israel. If a terrorist nuclear attack did occur in the United States, the first questions asked would be who did it, and where did they get the bomb? Bin Laden would top the list of probable perpetrators. But the supplier would be less certain; it could be Russia, Pakistan, or North Korea, but it could also be Ukraine or Ghana. Russia would probably top the list not because of hostile intent but because of the enormity of its arsenal of nuclear material, much of it still vulnerable to insider theft. Pakistan would likely rank second due to the ongoing links between its security services and al Qaeda, and the uncertain chain of command over its nuclear weaponry. North Korea, the most promiscuous weapon proliferator on earth, has already sold missiles to Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia and so would merit suspicion. As would Ukraine and Ghana, which operate Soviet-supplied research reactors with enough heu for one or more nuclear weapons. Interestingly, Saddam-era Iraq would not have even made the top ten. To be fair, since September 11, the Bush administration has taken steps to reduce the danger of a nuclear attack by terrorists. It has attacked al Qaeda training bases in Afghanistan and around the globe and enlisted more than 100 nations in a global effort to share intelligence, enforce antiterrorism legislation, and curtail the flow of terrorists' money. Bush has repeatedly declared that the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) would be &quot;intolerable,&quot; prompting similar declarations from key allies. Recently, he also proposed a UN Security Council resolution that would criminalize WMD proliferation and promoted the Proliferation Security Initiative, an 11-nation group that, stretching existing legal frameworks, will search vehicles suspected of transporting WMD cargo on the high seas. After initial skepticism, the administration has also embraced the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to secure and eliminate former Soviet nuclear weapons and has enlisted other members of the g-8 group of leading industrialized countries to match Washington's $1 billion annual commitment to the program over the next decade. And the United States has cooperated with Russia to extract three potential nuclear weapons from Serbia and one from Romania. But the list of actions not taken by the administration remains lengthy and worrisome. Bush has not made nuclear terrorism a personal priority for himself or those who report directly to him. And he has resisted proposals by Senator Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), former Senator Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), and others to assign responsibility for the issue to a single individual, who could then be held accountable. As a result, were the president today to ask his cabinet who is responsible for preventing nuclear terrorism, either a dozen people would raise their hands, or no one would. Bush has also not communicated his sense of urgency about nuclear terrorism to the presidents of Russia or Pakistan. Nor has Bush increased the pace of U.S. cooperation with Russia in securing former Soviet nuclear weapons and materials. As a result, after a decade of effort, half of the Soviet arsenal remains inadequately secured. More generally, the Bush administration has not acted to change the prevailing practice that allows states to decide for themselves how secure weapons and materials on their territories will be. More than 100 potential weapons, such as those extracted from Serbia, still sit in a dozen countries in circumstances that leave them vulnerable to theft. In this context, it is impossible to avoid mentioning Iraq. The Bush administration used the danger that Saddam might supply WMD to terrorists as its decisive argument for war. The subsequent failure to find evidence of these weapons has compromised the administration's credibility on the general subject of WMD, as well as the perceived competence of the U.S. intelligence community. Moreover, during the year and a half in which the United States sought to get other countries to support its Iraq policy, North Korea and Iran were able to accelerate their own programs. Mounting a serious campaign now to prevent nuclear terrorism will thus be more challenging than it would have been before the Iraq war. NO, NO, NO Preventing nuclear terrorism will require a comprehensive strategy: one that denies access to weapons and materials at their source, detects them at borders, defends every route by which a weapon could be delivered, and addresses motives as well as means. Aggressive offense to disrupt and destroy organizations and individuals that could attack the United States must be matched by robust defenses at home. Washington may still sometimes have to act unilaterally. But the United States will not be able to bully other nations into taking all the necessary steps. Successful counterterrorism requires multinational intelligence and local police enforcement. For example, last summer's capture of al Qaeda's Southeast Asia mastermind resulted from a tip from suspicious neighbors, who informed Thai authorities who, in turn, called the CIA. If properly encouraged, foreign nationals and governments can play a huge role in tracking down terrorists. If not, they become a sympathetic sea in which terrorists can swim and hide. The centerpiece of a serious campaign to prevent nuclear terrorism -- a strategy based on the three no's (no loose nukes, no new nascent nukes, and no new nuclear weapons states) -- should be denying terrorists access to weapons and their components. After all, no nuclear weapons or material means no nuclear terrorism; it's that simple. The first part of the strategy -- no loose nukes -- would require rapidly securing all nuclear weapons or weapons-usable material under a new &quot;International Security Standard&quot; that would ensure that terrorists could not acquire weapons or their components. The United States and Russia should develop such a standard together and act quickly to secure their own weapons and materials in a manner sufficiently transparent to give each other assurance that their stockpiles could not be used by terrorists. Moscow and Washington should then go quickly to other nuclear-weapons states and demand that they too meet this new benchmark for nuclear security and be certified by another member of the club as having done so. If necessary, technical assistance in meeting these standards should be offered. But the United States and Russia should also make clear that this is not a negotiable demand. Simultaneously, a &quot;Global Cleanout Campaign&quot; should extract all nascent nukes from all other countries within the next 12 months. Since all research reactors in non-nuclear weapons states contain fissile material that came from either the United States or Russia, each has a sufficient legal claim to demand its return. Compensation and wrangling may be required. But the United States and Russia must not take no for an answer. A &quot;no new nascent nukes&quot; approach will require ensuring that all nuclear aspirants, especially Iran and North Korea, stop producing heu and plutonium. This effort should begin under the auspices of inspections mandated by the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), including the NPT's Additional Protocol that allows more intrusive inspections of suspected nuclear sites. But two other elements must also be added to the current system: a prohibition on the production of fissile material, and actual enforcement mechanisms. Enforcement should begin with political and economic sanctions for recalcitrant states but should also include threats and the use of military force if necessary, whether covert or overt. Enhanced export controls and greatly strengthened intelligence capabilities (especially human agents) should focus on preventing the work of nuclear aspirants and stopping sales from potential suppliers. Ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (which the Bush administration has rejected, despite support from four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Secretary of State Colin Powell) and the negotiation of a cutoff in production of fissile material in current nuclear-weapon states would reinforce this principle. Iran will be a decisive test of this strand of the new strategy. The administration has declared that the United States &quot;will not tolerate the construction of a nuclear weapon&quot; by Iran and has elicited similar threats from its allies. American assertiveness has galvanized the IAEA to demand that Iran prove a full account of past and present nuclear activity. Unless Iran complies, the IAEA will refer the case to the UN Security Council. Note the differences between the administration's current approach and the &quot;no new nascent nukes&quot; approach proposed. The administration has named Iran a member of the &quot;axis of evil&quot; and threatened it with regime change. It has tried to persuade Russia to halt construction of Iran's Bushehr light-water nuclear power plant. And it has accepted verbal declarations of support from Iran's trading partners in Europe. The proposed strategy, in contrast, would focus on one objective only: denying Iran material from which nuclear weapons can be made. This would mean preventing Iranian enrichment of uranium or reprocessing of spent fuel to produce plutonium. With Russian President Vladimir Putin as his partner, Bush would remind Iran that in signing the NPT, it forswore nuclear weapons, and he would demand that Iran verifiably dismantle any emerging capability for enrichment or reprocessing. To win Moscow's support, Washington should accept Russian completion of the Bushehr reactor, confirm Russia's role as fuel supplier to the reactor, initiate joint Russian-American research on new proliferation-resistant nuclear power plants, and agree that Russia become the secure depository for international spent fuel.<br />

And, Creating a Whitehouse post solves proliferation while avoiding turns<br />

There's wide agreement that the fundamental problem with U.S. efforts to secure WMD abroad is a lack of vision, coordination, and leadership at the heart of our government--that is, in the White House itself. According to a May 2002 General Accounting Office report, for instance, existing efforts to combat nuclear smuggling are &quot;not effectively coordinated and $(lack$) an overall governmentwide plan to guide $(them$).&quot; The obvious solution would be the creation of a White House post, with direct access to the president, to oversee the myriad programs run by the Departments of State, Defense, and Energy. Yet despite years of admonitions from foreign policy luminaries of both parties, there is still no one in the executive branch with both the mandate and the authority to create a broader vision for a campaign against nightmare weapons. Bush's proposed Department of Homeland Security, with its domestic focus, doesn't solve this problem. (&quot;$(Tom$) Ridge wonders, 'How do we deal with something?'&quot; says NTI's Laura Holgate. &quot;But that's very different from, 'How do we prevent something in the first place?'&quot;) Until a high-level post is created, coordinating America's nuclear counterproliferation programs will remain the principal task of Susan Cook, a midlevel deputy at the NSC, who does not even report directly to Condi Rice, let alone the president. Until nuclear security is coordinated at the highest levels, the White House will continue to muddle along, giving some programs more money than they can spend, while senselessly chopping the budgets of others. The iaea, for instance, is the only global institution charged with policing nuclear material around the world. It is a fine frontline watchdog. And yet its $100 million budget for monitoring materials in dozens of countries is on par with the police department of a midsize American city. Moreover, that budget has seen zero real growth over the past 15 years, even as the agency's responsibilities have increased enormously. Without more money, for example, the IAEA may no longer be able to operate the security cameras it has installed to monitor the spent fuel pools of several reactors worldwide.<br />

Planetary colonization is only possible on Mars and the Moon – orbital colonies are superior in every way and solve resource access<br />

Because we are planetary creatures, when most people think about space colonization they usually envision homes on Mars or perhaps Earth's moon. Colonization of those bodies is in fact much less desirable than orbital colonization, even though Mars and the Moon are the only practical solid bodies suitable for colonization in the solar system, at least for the next few centuries. Venus is far too hot. Mercury is too hot during the day and too cold at night, as the days and nights are so long. Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus have no solid surface. Pluto is very far away. Comets and asteroids have too little gravity for a surface colony, although some have suggested that an asteroid could be hollowed out. This is actually a variant of an orbital colony. That leaves Mars and the Moon. However, both bodies are greatly inferior to orbital space colonies in every way except for access to materials. This advantage is important but not critical; lunar and asteroid mines can provide orbital colonies with everything they need. Mars has all the materials needed for colonization: oxygen, water, metals, carbon, silicon, and nitrogen. You can even generate rocket propellant from the atmosphere. The Moon has almost everything needed, the exceptions being carbon and nitrogen; water is only available at the poles, if at all. Orbit, by contrast, has literally nothing - a few atoms per cubic centimeter at best. How can you build enormous orbital colonies if there is nothing there? Fortunately, Near Earth Objects (NEOs, which include asteroids and comets with orbits near Earth's) have water, metals, carbon, and silicon -- everything we need except possibly nitrogen. NEOs are very accessible from Earth, some are easier to get to than our moon. NEOs can be mined and the materials transported to early orbital colonies near Earth. The Moon can also supply metals, silicon, and oxygen in large quantities. While developing the transportation will be a challenge, colonies on Mars and the Moon will also face significant transportation problems.<br />

As Robert Zubrin suggests in The Case for Mars (Zubrin and Wagner, 1996), small groups of Martian explorers can carry select supplies (hydrogen, uranium, food, etc.) and make rocket fuel, water, oxygen, and other necessities from the Martian atmosphere. However, to truly colonize Mars will require extensive ground transportation systems to get the right materials to the right place at the right time. These systems will be difficult and expensive to build, particularly considering the long resupply times from Earth. While Mars has an edge in material availability, orbital colonies have many important advantages over the Moon and Mars. These include: Rapid resuppply from Earth Continuous, ample, reliable solar energy Better communication with Earth Great views of Earth (and eventually other planets) Control of (pseudo-)gravity levels Weightless and low-g recreation near the axis of rotation Relatively easy 0g construction of large living structures Greater independence Much greater growth potential Near-Earth orbital colonies can service our planet's tourist, energy, and materials markets more easily than the Moon, and Mars is too far away to easily trade with Earth. None of this means that colonizing the Moon or Mars is impossible, of course. It is simply that this option is less desirable, and is more likely to come along after orbital colonization has been firmly established. This essential point has escaped many space advocates, perhaps because we are accustomed to living on a planetary surface. It's difficult to imagine living inside a giant spacecraft and even harder to take the concept seriously: but we should. It has profound implications for the future course of our National and International space programs.<br />

Oddly, in a seeming contradiction, Mr. Clarke also spoke of punishing China and other nations who purportedly use cyber attacks &quot;to steal high-tech American data.&quot; The problem with that line of reasoning is that you cannot punish someone if you're reluctant to use coercive force against them. The implications of Mr. Clarke's policy prescription of not being able to even threaten action against nations waging cyberwar against us would be devastating. Nations and non-state actors seeking to do us harm in cyberspace would, if we followed his advice, act with impunity against us. The nightmare scenario of our banking, transportation and other infrastructure systems not working would come to pass. A military overly reliant on GPS and other aspects of its cyber infrastructure would be rendered useless. The military, the rest of the government and the private sector need to develop ironclad responses and true &quot;work-arounds&quot; to actual and potential cyber attacks. We must develop a coherent national strategy to make these &quot;work-arounds&quot; possible and to employ them when necessary. While we should not advertise our specific offensive cyber warfare capabilities, we should put potential adversaries on notice that there will be consequences to cyber attacks on our country. The key to our security in all dimensions of warfare (land, sea, air, space and cyber) is to ensure that such adversaries fear our potential reaction. That is why the military must develop redundant capabilities, some of them harkening back to the pre-cyber era, so as to ensure the flexibility of our responses. The more difficult it is for adversaries to predict what our reaction might be, the less willing they will be to put their own critical national infrastructure at risk. These adversaries should know that our offensive cyber capabilities have the potential to wreak at least as much havoc on their IT infrastructure as they may plan to wreak on ours. Such a deterrent would give pause to rational state and non-state actors. but we also have to be prepared to deal with those who are undeterred, whether they are rational or irrational international actors. The development of a robust suite of offensive cyber capabilities is, therefore, a national imperative. It may be instructive to think of cyberspace as being similar to the sea or to space. There is a &quot;commons&quot; to protect; an area shared by all nations that allows each of them freedom of navigation. It also facilitates travel and communication. A &quot;commons&quot; is often protected by a consortium of powers. We see this in the world's reaction to the Somali pirates plying the Indian Ocean. Nations as diverse as the United States and China are working together to stop piracy in this region and to ensure freedom of navigation. That tells me that every effort should be made to establish agreed-upon international norms of behavior in cyber space. Once we achieve those, then the job of securing the cyber domain will become every nation's responsibility. To get there, though, we need to show our resolve to protect our interests in this rapidly evolving domain.<br />

<em>SWF believes that the solution to this problem is the creation of an International Civil Space Situational Awareness system. The goal of this system would be to provide all space actors access to the tools needed for safe and sustainable activity in Earth orbit. The two key tools this system would provide are sensor data and analytical capacity to utilize that data in decision-making processes. The concept of space situational awareness (SSA) is not new - it has been an important part of military space activities for several years. But like many other types of information, there is also a need for SSA in the civil world. The fundamental difference between the international civil SSA system SWF is advocating and that used by the military is in the types of information provided. Civil SSA only needs to focus on the location of an object in Earth orbit and a point of contact for that object, along with information about space weather. The additional military requirements of determining function, intent, and capabilities and limitations are not intended to be part of a civil SSA system. Global sensor coverage The Foundation believes that such a system needs to be international in both its creation and operations, Weeded advised the subcommittee. Accurate tracking of all objects in Earth orbit requires a geographically distributed network of both radar and optical telescopes. &quot;Such a network is very expensive to create and maintain, and only the United States has thus far developed one,&quot; Weeden pointed out. &quot;And while the United States' space surveillance network does provide the most complete SSA data in the world, it still has significant limitations due to the lack of coverage in areas where the United States does not have a presence.&quot; In addition to global sensor coverage, an international civil SSA system must also include data from commercial satellite owner-operators: these entities have data on the locations of their satellites more accurate than any ground-based sensor could obtain. &quot;The key to making such a system work is in the data sharing model,&quot; Weeden said. Central clearing house One potential model would have each participant in the system choosing what data they provide to a central clearing house. All participants would have access to all of the shared data in the clearing house, enabling them to do their own independent analysis. All participants would also have access to analytical support from the central data clearing house to offset the lack of indigenous capability. &quot;Many States, working together in a voluntary partnership with commercial partners, could provide the necessary data to all actors,&quot; Weeden said. &quot;This information could not only mitigate future collisions but enhance cooperation, transparency and future space governance issues.&quot; SWF is eager to work with organizations around the world to explore the possibility of an international civil space situational awareness system, along with other options and proposals that will enable safe and secure activities in Earth orbit.</em><br />

There are also space effects other than C4ISR that fall into the strategic realm. For the most part, these effects are likely better accomplished by traditional space-launched assets. Among these effects are force application and some aspects of space situational awareness (SSA) and counterspace. Force application from space is currently a contentious issue, 115,116 but space has been used as a transit path for weaponry since World War II. 117 The historic instruments of this force application method are, of course, ballistic missiles. There are currently a number of non-nuclear programs under investigation for the transitory use of space for global weapons delivery, including many housed in the common aero vehicle (CAV). 118 UAVs have also demonstrated their ability to effectively deliver ordnance. 119 Near-space assets, with the exception of perhaps the High Altitude Airship, do not appear to offer many force application possibilities due to their relatively small payload-carrying abilities, and even then their use as a force application platform appears to be better suited for tactical or operational levels of war. Other areas where traditional satellite concepts can accomplish much that near-space platforms cannot are related portions of the SSA/counterspace missions. Although the technology is currently experimental, military research labs are actively pursuing microsatellites with the ability to autonomously navigate near other satellites. 120,121 This ability could foreseeably allow these microsatellites to perform close inspection of other orbital assets, both friendly and otherwise, to determine probable missions and status much more accurately than the resolution limits of current ground-based systems could ever do. They could also potentially become potent anti-satellite weapons, taking on many subtle forms that close proximity, velocity-matched flying will enable. 122 Nearspace assets and UAVs will obviously never have such abilities.<br />
It must be noted, however, that there are strategic SSA effects that could be enhanced with near-space assets. Being above 96 to 99 percent of the atmosphere in the 65,000 to 120,000-ft altitude range, large telescopes with membranous, holographically corrected and/or adaptive-optically corrected mirrors could provide much better resolution of space assets than their earth-bound brethren that are limited to looking through the significant distortion of the atmosphere. 123 As solid-state directed energy devices grow simultaneously more powerful and smaller, they could also contribute to strategic activeillumination SSA programs aboard near-space platforms. Downward-looking lasers would also be highly effective, as the beam-distorting effects of the lower atmosphere would occur during the latter stages of beam propagation near the target, where the distance from the energy source would help to minimize distortion-induced pointing errors when compared with perturbations near the source. Several steerable platforms stationed near the North Pole could also act as a third sensor for missile defense, augmenting the DSP satellites and ground-based radars currently in use. Thus, near-space assets can act as another layer in a system of systems working to deliver strategic space effects. Figure 4. The Effect of the Location of a Perturbation between Source and Target. Near-space can also be a deterrent to opponents’ counterspace efforts, a distinctly strategic defensive mission. Potential adversaries are quick to recognize the US dominance in space, and also quick to recognize our associated spacerelated vulnerabilities. 124, 125, 126 One relatively easy way to negate this dominance would be to explode an exoatmospheric nuclear device. In addition to the destructive electromagnetic pulse (EMP) such an explosion would immediately create, it would also supercharge the Van Allen radiation belts for a period of six months to two years. Military satellites are presumably hardened against the EMP, but the extra radiation doses a satellite operating within the belts would receive could reduce the life expectancy of such a satellite to mere months. Additionally, the enhanced orbital radiation environment would remain lethal enough to delay reconstitution launches for one to two years. 127 Near-space can address these nuclear detonation issues by providing an alternative method for delivering space effects that would be unaffected by lingering space radiation. The availability of these assets could be a strategic deterrent to the intentional launch and high-altitude detonation of a nuclear device. For example, one of the primary space effects that threaten potential adversaries is the US dominance in navigation. Additionally, the availability of precision timing is critical to homeland security. All automated teller machine, credit card, and bank-to-bank transactions are synchronized via worldwide timing; should that timing function fail our economy would be turned off for a significant period of time.<br />

The negative consequences of a global space arms race are hard to exaggerate. Space-based weapons, like any other object on orbit, are inherently vulnerable to attack and best exploited as first-strike weapons. And because of the high-value (and high cost) of such weapon systems, commanders are likely to view them as “use them or lose them” assets – piquing itchy trigger fingers that could lead to rapid escalation of any crises. Indeed, any conflict involving ASAT use is likely to lead to rapid escalation of hostilities, in particular amongst nuclear states. The objective of an attacker would be to eliminate the other side’s capabilities to respond either in kind or on the ground by taking out satellites providing warning, surveillance, communications and targeting, leaving the other side blind, deaf and mute. At that point, the response is very likely to be nuclear, as the U.S. Air Force found out in conducting space war games.

Unless guards do body crevice searches of lab employees every day, smuggling out a few grams will be a piece of cake. Basically, THERE CAN BE NO SECURITY. Humanity is at great risk as we speak. All biological weapons must be destroyed immediately. All genetic engineering of new diseases must be halted. All bioweapons labs must be dismantled. Fort Detrick and Dugway labs must be decommissioned and torn down. Those who continue this research are potential war criminals of the highest order. Secret bioweapons research must be outlawed. The US, as the world’s leading creator of doomsday diseases, must lead the way and show the example. The US must not only obey the Convention Against Biological Weapons, which it has been violating, but it must sign the Biological Weapons Inspection Treaty, which it has been opposing. International delegations must be allowed to inspect and oversee the destruction of these labs and inventories. The doctrine of military deterrence must give way to the logic of human survival. Human survival must come before national sovereignty. Microbiologists and geneticists would do well to sign petitions and approve resolutions to the US and UN to take immediate steps to completely dismantle all bioweapons and labs. Albert Einstein opposed the use of atomic bombs. Norbert Wiener, inventor of guidance cybernetics, opposed guided missiles. Many Nobel laureates signed pledges not to work on star wars and nuclear weapons. It is the moral responsibility of those with scientific knowledge and academic prestige to prevent the misuse of their creations. These are the honored custodians of the precious gift of all future life. Congress should be asked to hold open hearings on the extent and legality of the U.S. bioweapons program. Concerned people can start gearing up for a campaign to abolish bioweapons. In Maryland, we can start with a movement to tear down Fort Detrick.<br />

The other political limitation is the international perception of the use of a fluoride fiber laser as an active source for collecting space ISR data. Since collecting this type of data from a MEO system is non-intrusive, fielding a system to collect this data falls in line with the first principle of the U.S. National Space Policy.90 However, each state’s perception will be that state’s reality. Consider the international reaction to the U.S. desire to achieve space superiority through offensive means. In response to the U.S. position, China specifically denounced the use of space weapons in their defense white papers released in 2002 and 2004.91 Accordingly, some states will perceive the laser payload of the conceptual SSA satellites as a weapon. This perception could be a problem if the “Smooth Sailing” scenario materializes. While the other two scenarios have the gradual “weaponization” of space, the strong international bodies in the “Smooth Sailing” scenario could produce a negative international response. For this political reason, the conceptual SSA system may never make a single orbit.<br />

<em>As mentioned in the RAND war-game scenario, China would be far less affected than the United States by the loss of most space assets at this point because its air-breathing ISR assets could cover the immediate theater and short-range ground communications that do not rely upon satellites. (37) Conversely, once US forces have deployed, they would rely heavily upon space assets. In a limited military engagement such as this, it is unlikely that the United States would attempt to facilitate ISR flights by establishing air superiority over all of China. US forces would thus remain highly reliant upon satellites for ISR over mainland China and for communication with the homeland and between deployed units. The RAND study also pointed out that China would likely contract commercial third-party space assets to provide needed capabilities, complicating repercussions from US attacks. All told, counterspace operations would probably prove as discriminate as possible to prevent strategic escalation. Both sides would hesitate to utilize kinetic-kill ASATs against anything but very low-altitude satellites for fear of incurring international condemnation and increasing debris hazards for their own resources. (38) In all likelihood, the United States would not use its kinetic ASAT capability, preferring to utilize its limited number of sea-based Standard Missile 3s for ABM defense of forward-deployed forces. Thus, the number of satellites destroyed or permanently disabled would be very low. As limited as this scenario appears, it bears out realistic actions taken under current policy and doctrine, given the resources available to each side. In this case, it is difficult to see how even one of our most capable space adversaries would have either the capability or the motivation to attempt a surprise attack on US space assets that would rise to the level of a space Pearl Harbor. It is also difficult to understand how the cost of deploying hundreds or even thousands of US weapon satellites to ensure space dominance would greatly affect the outcome of this scenario. Even a deployed space-based missile-defense shield probably would not encourage the United States to intentionally escalate a limited regional conflict with another nuclear power to a full nuclear exchange if there were any risk of nuclear warheads reaching US soil.</em><br />

Even if the military cannot learn many lessons about how to fix its space programs, there are a few lessons here for the rest of us. One lesson is that the military is not a good place to place your space bets. In the past few years people writing for The Space Review and elsewhere have proposed putting the military in charge of new large space weapons programs, or development programs like space solar power or suborbital transport. Given the military’s track record on its alphabet soup of programs—NPOESS, SBIRS, FIA, TSAT, MUOS, AEHF—why would anybody think that they could do a good job with SSP or an RLV tossed into the pot? A better long-term solution is to wait things out and hope that milspace gets its act together. A delayed start is far better than a prolonged and messy development. Another lesson is that whereas NASA and the military and intelligence space programs share the same pathologies, NASA’s are exposed to sunlight, which encourages reform—witness NASA’s housecleaning and reorganization after Columbia. Military space, and particularly the intelligence space program, operate in a more secretive environment where (this is just a theory) problems can fester for a long time before they are addressed. How could the situation at the once-proudly innovative and efficient National Reconnaissance Office get so bad that a high-level review team has recommended not just its reform, but its elimination? We don’t know, but NASA should consider itself lucky.<br />

In general, the Bush administration has been trying to spend as much money as Congress will allow on acquiring new military space capabilities, with annual requests that continue to rise despite congressional pressure for cost reductions and reallocations. So far, however, increased spending has not been matched by comparable advances in capabilities. Growing budget scrutiny and cost constraints have stimulated debate about whether the United States should devote even more of its military space acquisition budget to completing Clinton-era upgrades or whether it should leapfrog over next-generation satellites and invest more heavily in research on transformational systems that are at least a decade from deployment. The more fundamental question is whether a sustained commitment to either the incremental or the revolutionary acquisition route could reasonably be expected to reach the full SPACECOM vision. The experience of the past five years suggests that no matter how hard the Bush administration or subsequent U.S. leaders try, the costs and technical challenges of—not to mention other countries’ probable military reactions to—unilateral space security will keep total dominance out of reach.<br />

<em>Even without the Chinese ASAT test, there are flaws in War in Heaven. The authors claim that American military fears of a “space Pearl Harbor”—a surprise enemy attack on US military satellites—“borders on the absurd” because any nation capable of carrying out such an attack would realize that such an attack “would necessarily involve their own nuclear annihilation.” Do the authors really believe that the US would risk a global nuclear war to retaliate for the loss of some satellites? If so, they are more belligerent than even the most hardened war planners in the Pentagon. The book also would have benefited from a thorough fact-checking: in various places the authors claim that Europe’s Galileo satellite navigation system will be deployed by 2008 (it is unlikely now that the first operational satellite will be launched by the end of 2008), that a military technology program, the Common Aero Vehicle, “will be tested in 2006” (this in a book with a 2007 copyright date), and, bizarrely, that George H.W.

There is, of course, one plausible scenario where China could have incentive to attack US assets in space, despite its military disadvantage: a conflict over Taiwan. Kinetic-energy ASATs or other asymmetric counterspace weapons could very well be used if the United States employed its own space assets in a confrontation over the island. But this would be only in extreme circumstances, an act of desperation or selfpreservation, since China understands such a scenario could very well bring down the full force of US military might on China. The possibility of China making this calculation is far from certain, however, since to avoid escalation (possibly to nuclear exchange) or outright failure, China would need to reduce US military might to a level relative to its own (a formidable task even without space assets). Just diminishing US military dominance will not suffice if America remains powerful enough to prevail in a conflict. China may one day have the counterspace capability to achieve this goal, but one ASAT test does not get it there. For a successful kinetic-energy ASAT capability alone, China would have to conduct more tests, to say nothing of the other capabilities that would need to be developed and deployed to effectively disable US space assets. Furthermore, all this assumes that the United States is indeed highly vulnerable in space, an assumption scarcely borne out by current Chinese ASAT capabilities and inherent redundancy of US bspace assets. 3 This more narrowly defined scope for China’s counterspace capabilities fits within its overall strategic parameters and defined goals. And Tellis’s judgement that the potential conflict in space will ‘likely persist whether or not the Taiwan conflict is resolved’, is entirely possible if the United States and China find new strategic terms to compete over, but that outcome is speculative and is an entirely separate issue from China’s rivaling US space dominance writ large. A note on sources is also in order, since Tellis uses only secondary material to make sweeping assumptions about China’s military and counterspace strategies. The discussion of source material often comes up with the subject of China because of the difficulty in deciphering the vast body of literature, often of questionable reliability and predominantly in Chinese. Tellis remains undaunted, however, and cites secondary Western publications analysing this literature that primarily support his hawkish version of China’s space ambitions while giving scant mention to other more moderate positions. A selection of the provocative statements and ambitions on the American side would present a similarly distorted picture of US policy and intentions. A comprehensive reading of the Chinese literature is highly inconclusive with regard to both China’s policies and intentions as well as its programmes and capabilities.<br />

<em>Even if one assumes that some form of challenge to US hegemony is inevitable, China has a growing kit of tools at its disposal to wield nonmilitary influence. China now has clout in financial, trade and even softpower terms, all of which could bring to bear considerable economic and political pressure on a potential adversary or strategic competitor. This is not to suggest China would forgo its military options in a conflict with the United States. But it should, at the very least, give pause to consider alternative strategic modalities by China. Tellis doesn’t mention any of these, much less figure them into China’s counterspace strategy. Tellis brings that strategy within his broader framework of China’s goals to challenge and rival the United States. China’s best shot at accomplishing these expansive strategic goals, Tellis writes, is to have a ‘riposte against [America’s] Achilles heel’, its space dominance.</em><br />

Ashley Tellis weaves a compelling argument of China’s counterspace strategy and its implications for space arms control. His logic rests on two principle elements. ‘China’s pursuit of counterspace capabilities … is not driven fundamentally by a desire to protest American space policies … but is part of a considered strategy designed to counter the overall military capability of the United States.’ This underpins Tellis’s conclusion that ‘Washington should not invest time, energy and resources in attempting to negotiate space-control arrangements ... Such regimes are destined to be stillborn because the larger strategic logic conspires against them.’ In other words, the pursuit of a space arms-control regime is futile, even harmful to US interests, because China’s strategy to challenge American space dominance is unyielding to anything the United States can do. Both pillars of Tellis’s rationale are problematic. A comprehensive assessment of China’s strategic aims does not confirm such an inflexible posture. Rather, his assumptions about China’s strategy are far-reaching and worstcase scenarios, most of which are speculative and contradict considerable evidence. The United States, as he repeatedly points out, is an important driver of China’s strategic posture. As such, there are a number of measures the United States can indeed explore to positively alter the security dilemma in space. It is important to understand the core assumption underpinning all of Tellis’s analysis, which is related to but goes beyond the issue of space. That is, his overarching judgement that China is seeking to construct a ‘Sinocentric order in Asia and perhaps globally’. And since the ‘United States, and its superior military power, remains the biggest objective constraint on China’s ability to secure its own political interests’, China will not only challenge the United States in immediate concerns over Taiwan, but will rival US hegemony, particularly in military terms. How does Tellis know Beijing is committed to such an expansive military strategy or will challenge US military dominance? The evidence is inconclusive at best. China’s policies do not state such goals, but to avoid the debate over their reliability, let us leave government rhetoric aside. Chinese analysts, on balance, certainly argue against this paradigm and the US scholarly community is divided over the validity of such assumptions. That leaves individual interpretation of China’s strategic calculations; Tellis’s is imbued with a highly realist zero-sum framework. He cites the military component of China’s strategic interests as being ‘preventive’, ‘protective’ and ‘defensive’ in nature. Though these terms are fairly accurate, they only support the claim applied to specifically defined goals, which he concurs are, in the near term, ‘to defeat any US expeditionary force that might be committed in support of [Taiwan]’. From this point, however, he moves to a far more expansive strategy: ‘the capabilities thus obtained are intended to mutate gracefully into servicing other, more ambitious geostrategic aims’. In this way Tellis subtly, though assertively, leaps from ascribing to China a defensive posture to one that seeks to challenge and even rival US military power. The literature is not nearly so definitive. Such theorising of China’s strategic intent is highly speculative. Tellis uses a number of examples of American–Soviet competition to support his thesis that China will inevitably seek to confront US military dominance. Meanwhile, he declines to entertain the notion that China’s incentives and actions vis-à-vis the United States may be shaped by strategic values and interests outside his framework. In fact, China’s strategic considerations toward the United States are influenced and constrained by factors beyond a direct militarily antagonistic relationship. They range from China’s profound domestic development challenges; its precarious geopolitical relations with regional players; and its deep dependence on global commercial and energy markets. China also has a unique set of historical experiences (colonialism, foreign occupation, border wars) as well as the lessons learned from current events, not the least of which is the US quagmire in Iraq. These point to conditions for China and an international environment significantly different than were extant during the Cold War.<br />

<em>If China and the US are going to come into armed conflict with each other in the next several decades, it will almost certainly be over the status of Taiwan. China has, for instance, indicated that it would be willing to use force if Taiwan took steps to formalize its independence from the main land or otherwise prevent its eventual reunification under the rule of the People’s Republic. In such a scenario, it is entirely likely China could consider trying to negate or drastically reduce the US ability to use space at a tactical level. But China could not launch the massive attack required to have anything like a significant effect on US ability to utilize space without months of careful planning and pre-positioning of special, ASAT carrying missiles around the country. It would also have to utilize its satellite launch facilities to attack any US assets in deep space: the GPS navigation satellites and communications satellites in geostationary orbit. Most importantly, it would have to time the attack so as to hit as many US satellites as simultaneously as possible. And, despite all that movement, Beijing would somehow have to keep the whole thing secret. Failure to do so would undoubtedly result in the US attacking the large, fixed facilities China needs to wage this kind of war before the full blow had been struck. Even if the United States failed to do so, China would undoubtedly plan for that contingency. Based on the orbits of US military satellites determined by the worldwide network of amateur observers, there appears to be a large number of low Earth orbit military satellites over China several times each week. To hit them, China would have to preposition its ASAT-tipped missiles and their mobile launchers in remote areas of China, one position for each satellite. (If reports of low reliabilities for these missiles are correct, two or more missiles might be assigned to each satellite.) Furthermore, these positions are really only suitable for a particular day. If China’s political and military planners have any uncertainty at all about which day to launch their space war, they would need to pre-position additional launchers around the country. Thus, attacking nine low Earth orbit satellites could require as many as 36 mobile launchers—enough for two interceptors fired at each satellite with a contingency day if plans change—moved to remote areas of China; areas determined more by the satellite orbits than China’s network of road. (As will be discussed below, nine is about the maximum they could reasonably expect to hit on the first day of the space war.)</em><br />

But does China have enough to wipe out even a single set of American satellites? Let’s examine the possibilities: Attacking Navigation Satellites You need a launch pad to attack a target in deep space, like an American GPS satellite. China has just three of these pads. This really restricts China’s offensive capabilities in space. Assuming that China devotes all its deep-space ASATs on GPS satellites, it could destroy at most 16 satellites. At the current time, with 32 functioning navigation satellites, that would still leave 16 satellites still working. Over a period of years, the debris from those collisions would represent a significant threat to more than those satellites immediately attacked. They would pass, time and time again, through the belts of debris that resulted from the interceptions. However, it would probably take longer than the military conflict China initiated with these attacks before additional satellites were destroyed by subsequent collisions. Usually, there are about nine GPS satellites over China at any given time. If China somehow managed to destroy all of these, it could eliminate America’s use of precision-guided munitions—for a few hours, until the orbits of other GPS satellites take them over the Taiwan Straits. Quite quickly, the constellation’s other 23 satellites would fill in the gap due to their normal orbital movement. Even if it destroyed 16 satellites, China could still only interrupt GPS over the Straits for about eight hours. During the other 16 hours there would be the four or more satellites present over the target area for bombing runs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights, and ship tracking. This pattern of eight hours off followed by 16 hours when GPS could be used would be repeated every day until new satellites are launched. This outage would certainly cause difficulties; GPS not only guides American precision bombs – it helps pilot UAV spy planes, and monitor ships. US casualties might increase , with air crews forced to fly missions during daylight hours – and conduct some of the &quot;dull, dirty, and dangerous&quot; missions now flown by robotic planes. It’s a situation no American commander would want to face. But it would not be a catastrophic one. And it would not eliminate precision weaponry, UAVs, or any other American activity that depends on GPS. Keep in mind, this is the worst of the worst-case scenarios. It is highly unlikely that China could remove all the satellites over the conflict area at the same time. After all, attacking 16 satellites, all in different orbits with ASATs launched on just four different rockets involves some fairly complex orbital maneuvers. A much more likely scenario is that, at best, China could destroy four GPS satellites in the initial wave followed roughly seven hours later by four more, a third wave at roughly 45 minutes after that, and the final wave two hours later. Thus, the GPS attack is spread over ten hours and never eliminates all the satellites visible over the area of conflict at the same time. This Chinese attack on US navigation satellites would not eliminate or even significantly degrade the US’s ability use precision-guided munitions.<br />

Heg now—several warrants<br />
Friedman 9—chief executive, founder of STRATFOR. Former pol sci prof, Dickinson College. PhD in government, Cornell. (George, The Next 100 Years, 13-31)<br />
We are now in an America-centric age. To understand this age, we must understand the United States, not only because it is so powerful but because its culture will permeate the world and deﬁne it. Just as French culture and British culture were deﬁnitive during their times of power, so American culture, as young and barbaric as it is, will deﬁne the way the world thinks and lives. So studying the twenty- ﬁrst century means studying the United States. If there were only one argument I could make about the twenty- ﬁrst century, it would be that the European Age has ended and that the North American Age has begun, and that North America will be dominated by the United States for the next hundred years. The events of the twentyﬁrst century will pivot around the United States. That doesn’t guarantee that the United States is necessarily a just or moral regime. It certainly does not mean that America has yet developed a mature civilization. It does mean that in many ways the history of the United States will be the history of the twenty- ﬁrst century. There is a deep- seated belief in America that the United States is approaching the eve of its destruction. Read letters to the editor, peruse the Web, and listen to public discourse. Disastrous wars, uncontrolled deﬁcits, high gasoline prices, shootings at universities, corruption in business and government, and an endless litany of other shortcomings—all of them quite real—create a sense that the American dream has been shattered and that America is past its prime. If that doesn’t convince you, listen to Europeans. They will assure you that America’s best day is behind it. The odd thing is that all of this foreboding was present during the presidency of Richard Nixon, together with many of the same issues. There is a continual fear that American power and prosperity are illusory, and that disaster is just around the corner. The sense transcends ideology. Environmentalists and Christian conservatives are both delivering the same message. Unless we repent of our ways, we will pay the price—and it may be too late already. It’s interesting to note that the nation that believes in its manifest destiny has not only a sense of impending disaster but a nagging feeling that the country simply isn’t what it used to be. We have a deep sense of nostalgia for the 1950s as a “simpler” time. This is quite a strange belief. With the Korean War and McCarthy at one end, Little Rock in the middle, and Sputnik and Berlin at the other end, and the very real threat of nuclear war throughout, the 1950s was actually a time of intense anxiety and foreboding. A widely read book published in the 1950s was entitled The Age of Anxiety. In the 1950s, they looked back nostalgically at an earlier America, just as we look back nostalgically at the 1950s. American culture is the manic combination of exultant hubris and profound gloom. The net result is a sense of conﬁdence constantly undermined by the fear that we may be drowned by melting ice caps caused by global warming or smitten dead by a wrathful God for gay marriage, both outcomes being our personal responsibility. American mood swings make it hard to develop a real sense of the United States at the beginning of the twentyﬁrst century. But the fact is that the United States is stunningly powerful. It may be that it is heading for a catastrophe, but it is hard to see one when you look at the basic facts. Let’s consider some illuminating ﬁgures. Americans constitute about 4 percent of the world’s population but produce about 26 percent of all goods and services. In 2007 U.S. gross domestic product was about $14 trillion, compared to the world’s GDP of $54 trillion—about 26 percent of the world’s economic activity takes place in the United States. The next largest economy in the world is Japan’s, with a GDP of about $4.4 trillion—about a third the size of ours. The American economy is so huge that it is larger than the economies of the next four countries combined: Japan, Germany, China, and the United Kingdom. Many people point at the declining auto and steel industries, which a generation ago were the mainstays of the American economy, as examples of a current deindustrialization of the United States. Certainly, a lot of industry has moved overseas. That has left the United States with industrial production of only $2.8 trillion (in 2006): the largest in the world, more than twice the size of the next largest industrial power, Japan, and larger than Japan’s and China’s industries combined. There is talk of oil shortages, which certainly seem to exist and will undoubtedly increase. However, it is important to realize that the United States produced 8.3 million barrels of oil every day in 2006. Compare that with 9.7 million for Russia and 10.7 million for Saudi Arabia. U.S. oil production is 85 percent that of Saudi Arabia. The United States produces more oil than Iran, Kuwait, or the United Arab Emirates. Imports of oil into the country are vast, but given its industrial production, that’s understandable. Comparing natural gas production in 2006, Russia was in ﬁrst place with 22.4 trillion cubic feet and the United States was second with 18.7 trillion cubic feet. U.S. natural gas production is greater than that of the next ﬁve producers combined. In other words, although there is great concern that the United States is wholly dependent on foreign energy, it is actually one of the world’s largest energy producers. Given the vast size of the American economy, it is interesting to note that the United States is still underpopulated by global standards. Measured in inhabitants per square kilometer, the world’s average population density is 49. Japan’s is 338, Germany’s is 230, and America’s is only 31. If we exclude Alaska, which is largely uninhabitable, U.S. population density rises to 34. Compared to Japan or Germany, or the rest of Europe, the United States is hugely underpopulated. Even when we simply compare population in proportion to arable land—land that is suitable for agriculture—America has five times as much land per person as Asia, almost twice as much as Europe, and three times as much as the global average. An economy consists of land, labor, and capital. In the case of the United States, these numbers show that the nation can still grow—it has plenty of room to increase all three. There are many answers to the question of why the U.S. economy is so powerful, but the simplest answer is military power. The United States completely dominates a continent that is invulnerable to invasion and occupation and in which its military overwhelms those of its neighbors. Virtually every other industrial power in the world has experienced devastating warfare in the twentieth century. The United States waged war, but America itself never experienced it. Military power and geographical reality created an economic reality. Other countries have lost time recovering from wars. The United States has not. It has actually grown because of them. Consider this simple fact that I’ll be returning to many times. The United States Navy controls all of the oceans of the world. Whether it’s a junk in the South China Sea, a dhow off the African coast, a tanker in the Persian Gulf, or a cabin cruiser in the Caribbean, every ship in the world moves under the eyes of American satellites in space and its movement is guaranteed—or denied—at will by the U.S. Navy. The combined naval force of the rest of the world doesn’t come close to equaling that of the U.S. Navy. This has never happened before in human history, even with Britain. There have been regionally dominant navies, but never one that was globally and overwhelmingly dominant. This has meant that the United States could invade other countries—but never be invaded. It has meant that in the ﬁnal analysis the United States controls international trade. It has become the foundation of American security and American wealth. Control of the seas emerged after World War II, solidiﬁed during the ﬁnal phase of the European Age, and is now the ﬂip side of American economic power, the basis of its military power. Whatever passing problems exist for the United States, the most important factor in world affairs is the tremendous imbalance of economic, military, and political power. Any attempt to forecast the twenty- ﬁrst century that does not begin with the recognition of the extraordinary nature of American power is out of touch with reality. But I am making a broader, more unexpected claim, too: the United States is only at the beginning of its power. The twenty first century will be the American century. <br />

<em>Because current US space policy considers the entire space infrastructure a vital national interest, an attack against it or even preparation for one would likely incur a military response.34 Rationally, then, we would think that other nations would refrain from attacking US space assets unless they are engaging or already engaged militarily with us. In this regard, the deterrent threat of US retaliation would establish a lower limit to space conflict, much as it does with other forms of military confrontation.</em><br />
<em>The scenarios offered here include conflicts between the United States and three of the four nations capable of space attack mentioned above: China, North Korea, and Iran. Each highlights different aspects of US vulnerability and ways of constraining the United States in its responses. Russia is excluded due to its apparent lack of current capability and its similarity to China as another state with nuclear ballistic missiles. Considering the major nuclear powers, any direct conflict would occur over objectives below the level of national survival in order to avoid the risk of a nuclear exchange—the upper limit to realistic space-combat scenarios. With these lower and upper limits set, the scenarios include a limited conflict with China; a direct conflict with the more space-capable of the smaller opponents, North Korea; and a confrontation at the lowest level of space warfare with Iran. The development of these scenarios incorporates information available from war-game results that have included counterspace operations.</em><br />

<em>What 21st-century leader would risk his nation's survival on a risky surprise attack? Any nation that wanted to launch a Pearl Harbor-style attack on U.S. space assets would first have to conduct many tests in space. U.S. observation satellites and ground stations would detect those tests. Does anyone really believe that United States, even if an Adlai Stevenson style president were in the White House, would fail to respond vigorously to such a provocation? The United States does not lack for enemies. But just as tigers do not attack a healthy bull elephant, it is difficult to imagine that any nation would directly challenge the United States in space. Could a hostile country secretly mount a covert program capable of taking out a few U.S. military and surveillance satellites? Possibly. Could such an enemy secretly develop the capability to eliminate enough U.S. satellites to tip the balance of power radically in a surprise attack? Not likely. The question proposes a suicidal scenario as unreal as anything the bolt-from-the-blue crowd dreamed up during the Cold War.</em><br />

Tellis overstates both China’s ability and its incentives to use space in a conflict with the United States. He draws the analogy of Cold War competition between the Soviet Union and the United States: ‘neither side had an incentive to attack the other’s space systems, even though both developed modest instruments for this purpose, because the costs to each individually far outweighed the benefits’. The unstated implication is that China does have the incentive to attack America’s disproportionately vulnerable space assets. He is partly right; the United States is arguably now more vulnerable to asymmetric ASAT weapons that China could employ. But concluding that China has the incentive to act on this advantage removes the ‘battle’ of space out of the context of the larger conflict that such a battle would either be a part of, or would most probably escalate to. It wrongly isolates space from the US capabilities that could be brought to bear on a much inferior China in the dynamic of any military conflict. The United States has overwhelming military superiority over China. Besides vastly outnumbering China’s conventional and nuclear forces, other key elements include the dramatic advantage the United States has accrued in the past decade in precision-strike conventional weapons. These may even be capable of taking out even hardened nuclear silos in certain circumstances, thus comprising a new threat to China’s nuclear deterrence. 1 There is also the developing US multi-layered missile defence system with boost-phase components based in space that threaten China’s missile force. Even considering space alone, US capabilities and programmes far exceed those of China: for example micro- or nanosatellites, such as the XSS-10, XSS-11, DART, MiTex, Orbital Express and the new DARPA TICS and F6 programmes. There are also laser weapons: MIRACL, the ABL and its COIL, various solid-state HEL and FEL programmes, and the Starfire adaptive optics range, all of which have powerful ASAT capabilities. 2 All this means that even if the United States is currently vulnerable in space, China would have little incentive to attack American space assets because the risk of escalation to generalised conflict – a conflict China would have no chance of winning – is far too great, as Tellis admits. Failing to incorporate this into China’s strategic calculus leads to a narrow reading of what China is capable of, to say nothing of what its intentions may be. China’s own investment and interests in commercial and civilian space are also rapidly increasing, serving as a further check on any bellicose use of space.<br />

Another way in which a drastically enlarged investment in space-based assets could weaken American power is through the diminution of its resources. It would mean less money for other functions and missions like intelligence gathering or peacekeeping, let alone attempts to attack the economic and ecological roots of many present and future conflicts. 22 The hostility with which other states could greet American space dominance may also lessen American influence abroad, making it more difficult to jointly tackle with other states problems like the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.<br />

In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possible with the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild West of the late 1800s. With most, if not all, nations wearing nuclear 'six-shooters' on their hips, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations.<br />

Finally, we learn from air power that the application of force from any one medium may not be decisive on its own. Early air power advocates, like Douhet, believed that the airplane would be decisive in military conflict by itself. This invincible airplane would spread a helpless fear in adversaries and destroy their will to resist. This proclamation proved unfounded as Great Britain and others endured bombardment from the air during WWII and continued to resist. True, air power is an enormously important part of our military arsenal -- even more so now that true precision bombing has come of age -- but it cannot win or stop wars alone. The same will likely be true of space power.<br />

The United States depends enormously on its military space assets today. They do not function primarily as the great stabilizers and arms control facilitators of the cold war; in general, they have become the tools of the tactical warfighter. That reduces the strategic and political case for treating them as protected assets or viewing space as a sanctuary from military competition. But any U.S. policy to pursue the actual weaponization of space in the near term would be a mistake. It would probably lead to an arms competition that would put American assets at risk sooner than they otherwise would be. Coming in the face of strong international opposition, it would further exacerbate the image of the United States as a go-it-alone power. That could, in turn, weaken Washington’s ability to hold other countries to their arms control and nonproliferation commitments and to induce multilateral cooperation on other security issues. That said, military space competition will occur regardless of American policy, and other countries will gradually learn to use space more like the United States does today. That calls for a two-tier approach from Washington. It must continue to anticipate, and protect against, attacks on its satellites to the extent possible. Commercial communications satellites and lowaltitude military assets are probably the most apt to be vulnerable fairly soon, if not at present.

In fact it is possible that an extension of space power would diminish America’s ability to deal with these other problems. One way would be through the fostering of a false sense of invulnerability: the perception will be that the United States can neglect very real problems because it has its fortress in the sky. The sense that wars can be won swiftly from the air will enhance this by reducing the tolerance for more protracted operations, especially when they incur casualties: the success of Desert Storm made Somalia’s costs appear all the more unacceptable.<br />

Another approach for dealing with the inherent difficulties of satellite defense is “operationally responsive space” (ORS). Like other space strategic concepts, ORS has taken on several meanings. The one most discussed, however, is the Air Force proposal to launch on short (30-day) notice satellites to replace those destroyed by hostile action. The advent of entrepreneurial companies promising “cheap launch” has given some impetus to this idea. But cheap launch has not been demonstrated, and even if it could be, an ORS program would likely require considerable investment. Moreover, a prudent attacker preempting against U.S. satellites would enhance chances of success by retaining second and third strike capability with far less expenditure of resources than we would require to replace the assets he destroys. Although the U.S. would retain the option of attacking the ground installations supporting this second or third wave, counter measures – viz. launcher mobility – are well within the capability of major space-faring nations. Ground-based laser or pulse weapons could be dispersed and disguised, or based in unwitting third countries. The satellites replacing those destroyed would presumably be lighter, deployed in LEO where they would be less resistant to attack and only available after some delay. That might be a conceivable option in the era of large and protracted conventional war (if the problem of survivability of the satellites could be resolved). But technology has made sudden attacks to gain territory or for tactical advantage more likely, and against this sort of attack, a month-long loss of initiative could well be fatal.<br />

Finally, the notion of operationally responsive space is another example of how nomenclature can bias analysis. What U.S. commanders are interested in is not “operational responsiveness space” but operational responsiveness itself, however achieved. Space may very well not be the most cost effective way of achieving that goal.<br />
The next generation of GPS satellites will begin deploying in 2014. Both GPS and other systems currently in production are expected to have a service life of several decades, which means that U.S. strategic defenses will depend on large, single point of failure systems at least until 2040, and potentially well beyond. These systems cannot be retrofitted in orbit to increase their self-defense capabilities – even if practical measures were available to do so. Moreover, the cost of completing programs already approved as centerpieces of U.S. strategic space are such as to make the simultaneous development of alternative technologies problematic, at least without devoting considerable, additional resources to military space. There are circumstances in which this sort of budget commitment might be made; but that is hardly a desirable alternative from the point of view of the United States. Once the next generation of systems is on line, U.S. ground, sea and air forces will become even more dependent on space assets, and therefore more vulnerable to interruption of the information they provide.<br />

Perhaps the most formidable obstacles, however, are political and cultural. It is difficult to imagine the national leadership adopting a strategy of relying on unproven technology for key strategic capabilities, especially given the sunk costs already devoted to the next generation of satellites. Even if this decision were made by the new administration, the existing (and more vulnerable) satellite infrastructure would continue to provide the foundation of U.S. space capability for many years to come. As well, the advent of mini-satellites will tend to level the playing field, and de-value the U.S. industrial base. That industrial base is built to create large, complex, very capable satellites. No one can match us in that capability. But it is of less comparative value in an era of minisatellites, which – as a consequence – have little attraction for our large, aerospace companies. It is no coincidence that the locus of mini-satellite development has in the universities, or that the trend toward cheap, low technology launchers has been led by startups in the private sector.<br />

Meanwhile, advances in technology may offer an inherently more defensible means of deploying capability in space. Many argue that mini-satellites hold the promise of basing mode which is much more difficult for a possible adversary to target. 24 Constellations of these satellites might provide some or even most of the same functions of the existing satellite constellation. They could be designed to degrade incrementally, in essence reconfiguring to account for losses of some of their element to hostile action. Finally (and again, in theory), mini-satellites would be cheaper to develop than existing, large multi- function satellites. More redundancy would therefore be possible within existing budgets. All these characteristics of mini-satellite constellations would enhance deterrence. Indeed, adoption of this technology by all major space-faring nations might create the defense dominant atmosphere in space which is not only favorable for deterrence but for a stable and predictable space environment. There are, however, reasons for skepticism, not least that no one has so far succeeded in deploying constellations of mini-satellites. To quote a noted strategic analyst, “It’s possible to attribute any qualities you want to a system you have yet to develop.” 25 Thus, constellations of mini-satellites are said to have the potential of replacing not only command and control and electronic surveillance functions, but even reconnaissance missions that now require large structures to accommodate very long focal point cameras. It is also possible to conceive of mini-satellites employed as coorbiting hunter killers. None of these visions has been proven.<br />

In a paper accompanying his presentation, King identified another issue: access to the radio spectrum to allow for communications. Many smallsats have relied on the use of free amateur frequencies for communications, but that approach isn’t viable for commercial ventures. “Small satellite proponents have yet to deal squarely with this issue but, as the goal here is to discuss commercial missions, this issue becomes paramount and expensive,” he wrote. “Commercial users, nowadays, should even be prepared to have to pay for the use of the radio spectrum once a particular commercial application has shown itself to be commercially viable,” a process that can be time consuming and expensive, he adds.<br />

Heightened concern about orbital debris also raises an obstacle for smallsats, many of which have either limited propulsion systems or none at all. Orbital debris guidelines by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) recommend that satellites in low Earth orbits be able to deorbit no more than 25 years after the end of their missions. Many smallsats, though, are in orbits that will last more than 25 years, with no means of lowering orbits on their own, noted Dan Oltrogge of Analytical Graphics, Inc., in a conference presentation. “We’re not using best practices,” he said. “It reflects poorly on CubeSats if we don’t, and it’s something we need to be concerned about.”<br />

Another major challenge for the smallsat field is finding sustainable market niches. To date smallsats have found limited success, at best, in two commercial markets: communications and remote sensing, according to Jan King, who has worked on small satellites for over 40 years. In communications, ORBCOMM found some success with its constellation of satellites providing data services, and is in the midst of developing a replacement system for launch in the next few years. A related market, ship tracking, is also showing potential, he said. Remote sensing has been a bigger success, with a number of small satellites developed for government and commercial customers. “The real success in small satellite technology is in Earth imaging,” he said in his conference presentation. “I would say we had marginal success in telecommunications and pretty darn good success in remote sensing. In the rest of the area, I would say we have not produced to date.”<br />

<em>Most nanoproducts are not designed for the energy sector and will come at a net energy cost. Super strong nano golf clubs, wrinkle disguising nanocosmetics, and color-enhanced television screens take a large quantity of energy to produce, while offering no environmental savings. Such nanoproducts greatly outnumber applications in which nano could deliver net energy savings. The environmental demands of nanomanufacturing are higher than that of conventional materials. Nanomanufacturing is characterized by very high use of water and solvents. Large quantities of hazardous substances are used or generated as byproducts. Only one tenth of one percent of materials used to manufacture nanoproducts found in computers and electronic goods are contained in the final products. That is, 99.9 percent of materials used in manufacturing become waste products. Despite the serious uncer tainties, there is a growing body of research demonstrating that some nanomaterials used in energy generation, storage and efficiency applications can pose healt h and e nvir onme nt al r isk s . Car bon nanotubes are touted for use in electronics, energy applications, and specialty car and plane parts. However, early research shows that some forms of nanotubes can cause mesothelioma, the deadly cancer associated with asbestos exposure. The release of nanomaterials to the environment could also result in accelerated generation of potent greenhouse gas emissions. Antibacterial nano silver is used widely in clothing, textiles, cleaning products, personal care products and surface coatings. Yet preliminary study shows that when nano silver is exposed to sludge, similar to that found in typical waste water treatment plants, four times the typical level of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide is released. Nan o t e c h n o l o g y is n o t an u n q u ali f i e d environmental savior nor will its widespread use in everything from socks to face creams enable us to pursue ‘business as usual’ while substantively reducing our environmental footprint. At best, such claims can be interpreted as the result of wishful thinking on the part of proponents; at worst they can be seen as misleading greenwash. Nanotechnology is a powerful technology that has the potential to deliver novel approaches to the methods by which we harness, use, and store energy. Nevertheless, Friends of the Earth warns that overall, this technology will come at a huge energy and broader environmental cost. Nanotechnology may ultimately facilitate the next wave of expansion of the global economy, deepening our reliance on fossil fuels and existing hazardous chemicals, while introducing a new generation of hazards. Further, it may transform and integrate ever-more parts of nature into our systems of production and consumption.</em><br />

In the view of Friends of the Earth, the illusion of green nanotechnology is just that – an illusion that is promoted by a range of nanotechnology proponents keen to practice self-deception. Green nano does not currently exist in any meaningful sense – as an area of research, as industry practice, or as a viable alternative to the status quo. Yes, the environmental burden of nanomaterials manufacture could certainly be reduced, but neither researchers nor industr y will know enough in the near future to design environmentally benign nanomaterials or methods for their manufacture. In the meantime, the inconvenient truth is that nanomaterials manufacturing is a dirty, energy and water intensive process that both uses and produces many toxic chemicals, while nanomaterials themselves pose serious and poorly understood health and environmental risks. The need to adopt the precautionary principle to manage the serious but uncertain risks associated with nanotechnology has been recognized explicitly by governments from five continents. At the 2008 International Forum on Chemical Safety in Dakar, 71 governments, 12 international organizations and 39 NGOs recommended “applying the precautionary principle as one of the general principles of [nanotechnology] risk management” (IFCS 2008). Swiss Re, one of the world’s largest reinsurance agents, has also called explicitly for application of the precautionary principle in management of nanotechnology risks. In its detailed report into nanotechnology, the reinsurance agent warns: “In view of the dangers to society that could arise out of the development of nanotechnology, and given the uncertainty currently prevailing in scientific circles, the precautionary principle should be applied whatever the difficulties” (Swiss Re 2004, 47). The United Kingdom’s Royal Society, the world’s oldest scientific institution, recommended in 2004 that given the evidence of serious nanotoxicity risks, nanoparticles should be treated as new chemicals and subject to new safety assessments before being allowed in consumer products. It also recommended that nano-ingredients in products should be labeled, to give people the chance to make an informed choice. Further, the Royal Society recommended that factories and research laboratories should treat nanomaterials as if they were hazardous, and that releases of nanomaterials to the environment should be avoided as far as possible until it could be demonstrated that the benefits outweighed the risks (UK RS/RAE 2004). The European Union’s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks also recognized the many systemic failures of existing regulatory systems to manage the risks associated with nanotoxicity (EU SCENIHR 2006).<br />

<em>Some researchers have predicted that because such large sums of money are being spent by governments on nanotechnology research and development, funding priorities will be targeted to deliver societal benefit (Lloyd and Lave 2003). Unfortunately such predictions are not reflected in the funding figures to date. The Woodrow Wilson Center’s Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies conducted a detailed analysis of the 2006 US National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) budget request and found that only 1 percent of US$1.06 billion - $11 million - was allocated to research that was highly relevant to addressing nanotechnology risks (Maynard 2006). Maynard noted that this was in contrast to the $38.5 million figure cited by the NNI, “rais[ing] doubts about the validity and the basis of the NNI figures” (Maynard 2006, 18). In 2009, from a total of US $1.7 billion, the NNI states that $76 million was spent on environment, health and safety research (NSTC 2010). This figure is still only 4.47 percent of the total budget, and it is not clear how much of this work is highly relevant to risk research. For comparison, in the same year 26.78 percent ($459 million) was spent on nanotechnology r esear ch by t he Depar t ment of Defense. Beyond risk research, despite the public relations focus on socially and environmentally responsible green nano, the field attracted a mere 0.02 percent of the United States National Nanotechnology Initiative research funding from 2000 -2004 (Dunphy Guzman, Taylor and Banfield 2006); as of 2007 it continued to attract a very small proportion of US government research funding (Eckelman, Zimmerman and Anastas 2008). As Allenby and Rejeski (2008, p268) observe: “Despite early calls for a life cycle approach to nanotechnology deve lopme nt , pr oac t ive manage me nt of emerging risks, and the greening of production infrastructure, little has happened as the normal wheels of technological progress grind forward.” In addition to the very low research funding, and commercial and political priority attached to the field of green nano, the huge uncertainties surrounding nanomaterials’ behavior in environmental systems are a major obstacle to scientists’ capacity to achieve the much-touted “safety by design.” Nora Savage of the United States EPA cautions that no one knows yet what nanomaterials will do in the presence of other chemicals, or if they might heighten other chemicals’ risks: “I know people are trying to design environmentally benign nanomaterials… but all toxicity tests to date show that behaviors change with agglomeration, as coatings degrade, [and so on]. As they end up in the water, it’s going to be much more complex” (Lubick 2009, 1249). The uncertainty about potentially substantially increased toxicity of nanomaterials such as cadmium core quantum dots should coatings degrade has been emphasized by researchers (Bouldin, et al. 2008; Chen, et al. 2008b; King-Heiden, et al. 2009).</em><br />

In an article that explores the industrial ecology of emerging technologies, Allenby and Rejeski quote Princeton historian Ed Tenner’s observation of the “tendency of advanced technologies to promote self-deception.” They note that “the chance of such self-deception increases exponentially in the case of so-called ‘national prestige technologies’, such as nanotech” (Allenby and Rejeski 2008, 268). They warn that: “In our view, it is all too likely that industrial ecology may have missed the off-ramp to a green nanotech future about 5 years ago”. They caution that the United States and other governments keen to cash in on nanotechnology’s economic promise are largely avoiding attempts to steer nanotechnology development into greener channels. In a study commissioned by the European Parliament, Fiedeler questioned the common assumption that nanotechnology holds the potential to provide a substantial contribution to the solution of various ecological problems, including high consumption of energy and materials and the generation of waste (Fiedeler 2008). In a review of current examples and concepts of nanoproducts and applications, Fiedeler concluded that because nanomaterials themselves may introduce new toxicity risks, and because the nanomaterials production process may itself involve the production and use of hazardous materials, “it is unclear whether the current use of NT [nanotechnology] really provides new opportunities for the avoidance of hazardous substances” (Fiedeler 2008, 314). Arguably, given the concer ns about both nanomaterials and nanomaterial production processes, a first step in the green nano hierarchy would be to avoid or eliminate use of nano until its environmental implications are better understood and its safety is demonstrated. In his review, Fiedeler cautioned that each nano-application should be assessed in detail on a case by case basis. “Because such an assessment is complex and time consuming, proposals for substitution [of hazardous substances with nanomaterials] should only be analyzed if the benefit would be outstanding or if no existing solution is already available” (Fiedeler 2008, 313). In short, Fiedeler proposed that before we even ask of a nanoproduct “will it achieve what it is claimed to achieve,” that we first ask: “do we need this nanoproduct” and “do alternatives to this nanoproduct exist?” Similarly, other researchers have suggested that at the product design stage, the question should be asked whether there are any alternatives to use instead of manufactured nanomaterials that achieve the same functionality (Som, et al. 2010). Unfortunately, in the rush to market new cosmetics, electronic goods, sports equipment and clothing, this is not a question many companies are prepared to ask.<br />

<u>Boost phase interception does in theory offer great benefits in eliminating the effects of MIRVing. However, locating defensive weapons close enough to Soviet ICBM fields was problematic. The earth’s curvature meant that the early stage of a missile launch – the boost phase – would be out of the ‘line-of-sight’ of any surface based weapon. Guaranteed boost phase interception of Soviet ICBMs thus seemed to require space-basing, but even if the technology was available to achieve interception from space, there remained practical concerns. The logistics of putting sufficient defensive systems into orbit was (and still is) daunting. There is only one orbit, known as the geostationary orbit, where satellites move at the same speed as the earth rotates, and so stay above the same location. However, the geostationary orbit is 35800 kilometers above the equator and thus too far from boost phase targets for any realistic weapon to be effective.55 Satellites in orbits closer to the earth move across the face of the earth, and so maintaining a capability above a particular area, such as Soviet ICBM fields, would require a large number of satellites. In the early 1980s it was possible to be optimistic that the Space Shuttle might provide cheap transportation into orbit, but such optimism proved unfounded.56 Thus, apart from the availability or not of suitable weapons technologies, the cost of putting a constellation of battle stations into orbit led many to doubt the feasibility of the space-based approach. A further concern was that battle stations based in space would themselves be vulnerable to attack.</u><br />

<u><em>A space-based boost-phase defense is intended to intercept attacking missiles during the first few minutes of their flight, while the missiles’ engines are still burning. To reach attacking missiles during this very short time, SBIs must be stationed in low-altitude orbits. However, in these orbits SBIs move rapidly with respect to the ground and cannot stay over any one location on Earth. To keep at least one interceptor within reach of a given missile launch site at all times therefore requires many SBIs in orbit. A 2003 American Physical Society study showed that many hundreds or thousands of SBIs would be required to provide limited coverage against ballistic missiles launched from areas of concern. This estimate is consistent with the size of the space layer in the Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) missile defense system, which was proposed (but not built) by the George H.W. Bush administration in the early 1990s. GPALS called for 1,000 to 5,000 SBIs. Doubling the number of missiles that such a defense could engage would require doubling the size of the entire constellation of SBIs. Moreover, given the technology expected for the next decade, each SBI would weigh up to a ton or more. As a result, deploying such a system would be enormously expensive and actually would exceed U.S. launch capabilities. Additionally, such a system would raise significant issues for crowding and traffic management in space. Yet even if such a large system were built and the technology worked perfectly, it would not provide a reliable defense, for two reasons. First, even if the constellation of hundreds to thousands of interceptors described above were in place, only one or two SBIs would be in position to reach any given launching missile in time to destroy it. Consequently, the defense could be overwhelmed by simultaneously launching multiple missiles from one location. Second, the system could not protect itself from attacks intended to remove interceptors. Because SBIs would be in low-altitude orbits they could easily be detected and tracked from the ground; an adversary would know their current and future locations. As a result, any SBI would be vulnerable to attack by inexpensive short- or medium-range missiles. These missiles would burn out at too low an altitude to be intercepted by the SBI, but they could loft homing ASAT weapons at it. By destroying relatively few SBIs in this way, an attacker could create a gap in the defense through which it subsequently could launch its long-range missiles. In short, a defense based on deploying hundreds or thousands of SBIs at enormous cost could be defeated by a handful of enemy missiles.</em></u><br />

<u>The US Missile Defence Agency has suffered another embarrassing failure in a live test conducted last week over the Pacific. The trial saw a medium-range ballistic missile target lift off from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall islands, simulating an attack on the United States. The missile was was detected and tracked by the famous (and famously buggy) Sea Based X-band Radar, a large scanner mounted on a mobile oil-rig: this part of the exercise went without problems. A Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) triple-stage rocket was launched from Vandenberg Airforce Base in California, the US military's main space base. Apparently the triple-stage GBI itself worked properly, depositing an Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV, pictured) in the path of the oncoming missile warhead. What should have happened then is that the EKV should have used its small manoeuvring thrusters to get itself directly in the warhead's way. The combined many-thousands-of-mph velocities imparted by the rocket stacks of the missile and the GBI would then do the rest. However, a Missile Defence Agency statement says that the MDA &quot;was unable to achieve a planned intercept of a ballistic missile target&quot;, despite the deployment of the EKV being carried out &quot;successfully&quot;. &quot;Program officials will conduct an extensive investigation to determine the cause of the failure to intercept the target,&quot; adds the MDA. The expensive GBIs are supposed to be the most capable tool in the MDA's armoury, and are the only ones rated to knock out enemy warheads during the highest middle section of their ballistic flight. Under President Bush, the USA planned to site some of them, plus an X-band tracking radar, in Eastern Europe. But the GBIs have a spotty test record – the naval Standard SM-3, which is launched from a destroyer or cruiser at sea and can also deploy an EKV into space, is considered more reliable. The SM-3 successfully destroyed a crippled US spy satellite in low orbit above the Pacific in 2008, and since the Obama administration decided against the European GBI deployment there have been suggestions that a land-based version of the SM-3 could perform similar tasks.</u><br />

<u><em>The second fallacy lies in the assumption that a missile defense shield will prevent “bad guys” from being able to threaten the United States. That is decidedly incorrect. The oldest military truism is that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, because the enemy is not a static entity devoid of intelligence or desire for self-preservation. Exactly the opposite is true: any adversary is just as intelligent and driven as any attacker, and will react appropriately to whatever force is applied. If states such as Iran and North Korea truly want to terrorize and cause harm, as missile defense advocates argue, having “perfect” missile defense will only cause them to seek other methods of doing so, and thus in the long run provide no guarantee of safety at all to the free peoples of the world.</em></u><br />

<u>Even more troubling is the fact that the study's more realistic scenarios include assumptions that are forgiving in the extreme. For example, these scenarios include only 30 seconds of time for a decision to fire - the best-case analysis assumed an automatic shot once a potential target was detected. This is highly problematic, in that it is impossible to tell during the early boost-phase whether what just went up was an ICBM or a space-launch vehicle carrying a satellite (or, in the case of China, possibly astronauts). To put it mildly, it seems unlikely that any U.S. commander in chief would be comfortable with automating such a momentous decision. Furthermore, as noted above, these scenarios all are based on essentially a one-shot (in some cases, two-shots), one-kill architecture. This means there is no margin for error; no redundancy in the system. If North Korea decided to launch two ICBMs (once they get them) at Alaska from nearby launch sites, the U.S. networks postulated by the study would most likely be useless. To be able to target multiple interceptors at each incoming ICBM, however, not only involves even more astronomical costs, but also raises the technical problem of ensuring that the interceptors don't become confused and mistake another of their fellow interceptors for the target. The APS study, in its generosity, called space-based missile defense &quot;impractical.&quot; A more realistic look at the data shows that it is wildly so.</u><br />

<u><em>Space-based interceptors also have a lower limit on the altitude at which they can intercept a missile. This is due to blinding of their onboard infrared sensors, required for terminal tracking and guidance, caused by the intense atmospheric heating that results when the interceptor enters the atmosphere at high speed. Typically, space-based interceptors cannot intercept targets below 100 kilometers due to this effect. The numbers in Table 1 indicate that space-based interceptors could not engage liquid fueled missiles with ranges less than approximately 3,000 kilometers. Moreover, if countries develop solid-fuel missiles, which have shorter burn times and burn out at lower altitudes than liquid-fueled missiles, and fly their missiles on slightly depressed trajectories, even longer range missiles can underfly space-based interceptors.</em></u><br />

<em>The practicality of space-based systems, on the other hand, hinges on the cost of putting them into orbit, but cost estimates depend on the weight of the interceptors and number required, and this calculation in turn is based on assumptions about the duration of enemy missiles’ boost phase and the speed of the interceptors. This calculus is further complicated by the potential countermeasures that could be used by enemies seeking to overcome a boost phase defence. Thus, the claim that boost phase interception eliminates the problem of midcourse discrimination can be countered by the argument that opponents could deploy missiles with such short boost phases as to make interception practically impossible. Even with a boost phase lasting four minutes (typical for liquid-fueled ICBMs compared to three minutes for solid-fueled ones), the time left for interception is very short once detection, tracking and decision-making are taken into account.129 In addition, the APS study noted other countermeasures that could defeat boost-phase defences -- whether terrestrially or space based – ‘such as maneuvering and deployment of thrusted decoys during upper stage boost, and even multiple upper stages (all of which were employed in one form or another as early as 40 years ago.)’130</em><br />

<em>For missiles armed with a nuclear warhead, an attacker could deploy decoys to overwhelm U.S. NMD. Decoys take advantage of the fact that all objects with the same initial velocity travel along identical paths in the vacuum of space, regardless of their mass. With the proposed NMD system, the kill vehicle would attempt to distinguish between simple balloon decoys and warheads on the basis of their infrared signatures. Tests done so far leave serious doubts about whether the system will be able to reliably distinguish warheads from balloons.35</em><br />

Both the United States and Russia rely on space-based systems to provide early warning of a nuclear attack. If deployed, however, U.S. space-based missile defense interceptors could eliminate the Russian early warning satellites quickly and without warning. So, just the existence of U.S. space weapons could make Russia’s strategic trigger fingers itchy. The potential protection space-based defenses might offer the United States is swamped therefore by their potential cost: a failure of or false signal from a component of the Russian early warning system could lead to a disastrous reaction and accidental nuclear war. There is no conceivable missile defense, space-based or not, that would offer protection in the event that the Russian nuclear arsenal was launched at the United States. Nor are the Russians or other countries likely to stand still and watch the United States construct space-based defenses. These states are likely to respond by developing advanced anti-satellite weapon systems. 1 These weapons, in turn, would endanger U.S. early warning systems, impair valuable U.S. weapons intelligence efforts, and increase the jitteriness of U.S. officials. The Dangers of Failed Early Warning Systems The Russian early warning system is in serious disrepair. This system consists of older radar systems nearing the end of their operational life and just three functioning satellites, although the Russian military has plans to deploy more. The United States has 15 such satellites. Ten years ago, on January 25, 1995, this aging early warning network picked up a rocket launch from Norway. The Russian military could not determine the nature of the missile or its destination. Fearing that it might be a submarine launched missile aimed at Moscow with the purpose of decapitating the Russian command and control structure, the Russian military alerted President Boris Yeltsin, his defense minister, and the chief of the general staff. They immediately opened an emergency teleconference to determine whether they needed to order Russia’s strategic forces to launch a counterattack.<br />

<em>Nearly 20 years after the Cold War ended, humankind still faces the distinct possibility of instant extinction without representation. If nuclear war occurs between Russia and the United States, there will be no parliamentary or congressional debates nor declarations of war. In a time of crisis or perceived attack, the Russian and U.S. presidents each have only a few minutes to make a decision to order an attack against each other. The time frame for those decisions could be as short as seven minutes, depending on the nature of the perceived attack and the efficiency of communications within the respective early-warning chains of command. Launch-to-landing time for submarine-launched nuclear missiles can occur in as few as four minutes. Launch-to-landing time for hundreds of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles is about 25 minutes. An attack with just two 1-megaton nuclear warheads would unleash explosive power equivalent to that caused by all the bombs used during World War II. For the duration of the Cold War, leaders of the United States and USSR were concerned about the devastation both countries would experience if a nuclear war were triggered by a false alarm attributable to human or technological error. The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack on New York killed nearly 3,000 people, causing massive destruction, chaos and grief. In comparison, a purposeful or accidental nuclear strike between the United States and Russia would kill hundreds of millions in the short term and many more over time caused by worldwide, wind-driven nuclear fallout. Thus, the threat of nuclear war is the most serious potential health, environmental, agricultural, educational and moral problem facing humanity. Steven Starr, senior scientist with Physicians for Social Responsibility, said research makes clear the environmental consequences of a U.S.-Russian nuclear war: “If these weapons are detonated in the large cities of either of their nations, they will cause such catastrophic damage to the global environment that the Earth will become virtually uninhabitable for most humans and many other complex forms of life.” (See www.nucleardarkness.org.)</em><br />

Nuclear war by accident, miscalculation or madness is a greater risk than a deliberate use of nuclear weapons. It has been suggested that the President and a small group of successors have sole control of the &quot;black-box&quot;, a device which puts an electronic lock on all strategic nuclear weapons. But what if a potential enemy detonated a suitcase-nuclear-bomb in Washington, D.C. on Inauguration day killing every one who had authority to unlock the weapons? There would be no early detection from the suitcase-bomb, which would precede an all out nuclear attack without fear of retaliation. Black-box or not, is it credible that under those circumstances a nuclear submarine commander, who learned of what had happened, would be physically unable to launch his missiles? If he could not, then you would have a very safe system to prevent the &quot;mad commander&quot; scenarios, but one which would be inviting to sneak attack. On the other hand, if the sub-commander could launch his missiles, then this would suggest that even in a time of peace the &quot;mad commander&quot; could still work out his own version of the Strangelove scenario to overcome the safeguards. In a nuclear crisis, tens of millions of lives would depend on communications. We've been given some information about the &quot;hot-line&quot; but the nuclear powers should be much more open about the details. Like so many other things that are secret and never used, sloppiness, complacency and lack of imagination tend to take over.<br />

<em>Accidental nuclear war is not so far-fetched. In 1995, Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian scientific rocket as the onset of a U.S. nuclear attack. Then-President Boris Yeltsin activated his &quot;nuclear briefcase&quot; in the first stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the mistake was discovered. The United States and Russia have acknowledged the possibility that Russia's equipment might mistakenly conclude the United States was attacking with nuclear missiles. In 1998, the two countries agreed to set up a joint radar center in Moscow operated by U.S. and Russian forces to supplement Russia's aging equipment and reduce the threat of accidental war. But the center has yet to open. A major technical problem exacerbates the risk of using the D5 as a conventional weapon: the decaying state of Russia's nuclear forces. Russia's nuclear missiles are tethered to early warning radars that have been in decline since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. And Russia, unlike the United States, lacks sufficient satellites to supplement the radars and confirm whether missile launches are truly under way or are false alarms. The scenario that worries Postol, Podvig and other weapons experts is what might happen if the United States and North Korea come to blows and a conventional D5 is launched against a target there from a submerged Trident submarine. Depending on the sub's location, the flying time to Russia could be under 15 minutes so the Russians would have little time to confirm the trajectory -- using decaying equipment -- before deciding to launch a nuclear strike on the United States. The D5 missile project involves the removal of nuclear warheads from as many as two dozen D5 ICBMs that are carried aboard the U.S. fleet of 12 Ohio-class Trident submarines. The Pentagon has the project on an accelerated schedule, with the goal of fielding the weapons alongside their nuclear variants in two years. Each Trident submarine carries 24 D5 missiles, and the plan calls for using two of those as conventional weapons in each sub. The rocket fired by a submerged submarine would barrel up through the ocean powered by its three-stage engine and rapidly ascend through the atmosphere at speeds up to 20,000 feet per second into outer space. The warhead compartment of the missile would then plummet back to earth, guided to its target within about 50 feet by sophisticated sensors. Defense officials believe it would gain enough speed and force to penetrate underground command bunkers.</em><br />

A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization.[4] Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately. There is also a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan for instance, is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently. Such a war might however be a local terminal risk for the cities most likely to be targeted. Unfortunately, we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century.<br />

<em>In the end, a space war can be “won” only in a purely tactical sense. At a strategic and global level these tactical gains are hugely offset by the long term degradation of the space environment, perhaps even leading to the complete denial of the use of space by any party. The consequences of conflict in space can also be illustrated through another military scenario – nuclear warfare. Parallels can be drawn between the thousands of nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles poised on a hair trigger alert and the deployment of fully developed counterspace capabilities by paranoid nations. The most serious of these parallels is the potential for escalation and heightened tension leading to undesired actions. And while it can be argued that nuclear weapons actually prevented large-scale conventional war, they did so at an enormous economic cost and they created many side effects that will continue to cause problems long into the future. This Cold War analogy only goes so far since the current international relations environment is fundamentally different than anything seen since World War II. There is no longer a simple zero-sum situation with two great powers espousing two opposite philosophies backed by massive conventional and nuclear armies. The modern world is a highly dynamic one where nations are interlinked through complex economic ties and where the main prize is international soft power and influence rather than physical territory. Thus, this system inherently already has a form of economic deterrence damping major military action among major powers. There is no need to develop a “space deterrence” similar to nuclear deterrence that was used in the Cold War. Hopefully, we can learn from our history and avoid making the same mistakes in the emerging domain of space. As stated at the end of the movie “War Games,”“the only winning move is not to play the game.” Space wafare and weaponization is a game that no nation can afford to play.</em><br />

<em>China is another matter. No sane figure in the Pentagon wants a war with China, and all serious US militarists know that China's minuscule nuclear capacity is not offensive but a deterrent against the overwhelming US power arrayed against it (twenty archaic Chinese warheads versus more than 7,000 US warheads). Taiwan, whose status constitutes the still incomplete last act of the Chinese civil war, remains the most dangerous place on earth. Much as the 1914 assassination of the Austrian crown prince in Sarajevo led to a war that no one wanted, a misstep in Taiwan by any side could bring the United States and China into a conflict that neither wants. Such a war would bankrupt the United States, deeply divide Japan and probably end in a Chinese victory, given that China is the world's most populous country and would be defending itself against a foreign aggressor. More seriously, it could easily escalate into a nuclear holocaust. However, given the nationalistic challenge to China's sovereignty of any Taiwanese attempt to declare its independence formally, forward-deployed US forces on China's borders have virtually no deterrent effect.</em><br />

<em>To prevent adversaries from shooting back, the United States would need to know exactly where all threatening space objects are located, to neutralize them without producing debris that can damage U.S. or allied space objects, and to target and defeat all ground-based military activities that could join the fight in space. In other words, successful space warfare mandates pre-emptive strikes and a preventive war in space as well as on the ground. War plans and execution often go awry here on Earth. It takes enormous hubris to believe that space warfare would be any different. If ASAT and space-based, ground-attack weapons are flight-tested and deployed, space warriors will have succeeded in the dubious achievement of replicating the hair-trigger nuclear postures that plagued humankind during the Cold War. Armageddon nuclear postures continue to this day, with thousands of U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons ready to be launched in minutes to incinerate opposing forces, command and control nodes, and other targets, some of which happen to be located within large metropolitan areas. If the heavens were weaponized, these nuclear postures would be reinforced and elevated into space. U.S. space warriors now have a doctrine and plans for counterspace operations, but they do not have a credible plan to stop inadvertent or uncontrolled escalation once the shooting starts. Like U.S. war-fighting scenarios, there is a huge chasm between plans and consequences, in which requirements for escalation dominance make uncontrolled escalation far more likely. A pre-emptive strike in space on a nation that possesses nuclear weapons would invite the gravest possible consequences. Attacks on satellites that provide early warning and other critical military support functions would most likely be viewed either as a surrogate or as a prelude to attacks on nuclear forces.</em><br />

Space Weaponization The United States has been quietly working on implementing this vision. Space weaponization is a relatively long-term project that is expected to culminate by 2030. But the pace seems to be quickening. The Pentagon has produced a series of doctrinal documents that clarify what is meant by war in space and how it is to be properly waged. Hitherto, the program has emphasized improving situational awareness in space. It’s impossible to wage war in space without knowing precisely who has what where. However, in the 2008 budget, Congress appropriated $7 million dollars for “offensive counterspace” operations out of a $53 million dollar budget for “counterpace operations” which actually amounts to an increase in the level of funding sort by the White House. That suggests that the United States is moving up a gear on space weaponization and that this has both congressional and White House support which is critical for long-term strategic planning. In fact we have just learnt that the Air Force is working on plans to develop a “counter-ASAT” space weapon system by 2011. Reports suggest that most aspects of these plans are secret but some information has emerged in the public domain that sheds some interesting light on US space weapons planning. The system is known as the Rapid Attack Identification Detection Reporting System (Raidrs) Block 20. The rationale for this program is to develop information in a timely fashion to enable the Pentagon to intercept a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon, which are launched from the Earth, before it strikes its target in low earth orbit. But if the asset used to achieve this objective is space based then this may well enable BMD hawks to also obtain a space based BMD interception capability and there is no reason to suppose that a “counter-ASAT” weapon could not also function as an offensive space weapon. Nascent Asian Space Race As noted, China has tested an anti satellite weapon and Russia has stated that it would not allow other states to control space and threaten its own space assets. In Asia a nascent space race seems to be developing between China, Japan and India. In the far future the large deposits of Helium-3 on the moon's surface could lead to a militarized race to colonize the moon to secure Helium-3 for nuclear fusion energy technologies based on anuetronic fusion reactions in the context of depleting hydro-carbons. Washington argues that it has too much commercially riding on space to allow others to have the potential capability of disrupting U.S. space assets. In 1998 the failure of one satellite, the Galaxy IV, made some 80% of pagers in the U.S. malfunction. Though the latest Russian and Chinese space arms control proposal is flawed, because of the clumsy definition of what constitutes a “space weapon,” this doesn’t mean that space arms control is not possible in principle. A global space arms control regime would protect U.S., Russian, Chinese, and even Australian space assets. An arms race in space will eventually lead other states to catch up with the United States and thereby placing Washington's commercial satellites at risk. Space weaponization may well have cataclysmic consequences given the link between space weapons and nuclear weapons strategy. This is because Russia, and the United States, to a certain extent rely on satellites for early warning of nuclear attack. As other space nations with nuclear weapons develop their space capacity it is expected that they will follow suit. The deployment of space weapons means that the first shot in a nuclear war would be fired against these early warning satellites. Currently strategic planners in Moscow have about 10 minutes between warning of an attack and the decision to launch nuclear weapons in response before they impact. Weapons in space would lower this in certain scenarios down to seconds. This would also apply for weapons placed in space that would be considered to be defensive such as say a space based BMD interceptor or a “counter-ASAT” weapon. On occasion, ground warning radars falsely show that a nuclear attack has been launched. In the 1990s a false alarm went all the way up to President Boris Yeltsin and was terminated after approximately eight minutes. We are still here, noted analysts believe, because warning satellites would have given Moscow real time information showing the alarm to be false. Should such a false alarm coincide with an accident involving an early warning satellite when space weapons are known to exist, an accidental nuclear exchange could result. The risk would increase if the false alarm occurred during a crisis. Space weapons could lead to itchy fingers on nuclear triggers. They would therefore significantly increase the importance nuclear weapon states place upon nuclear deterrence.<br />

The prospect that space weapons might render the United States invulnerable to any kind of attack will remain tempting. And, for the foreseeable future, it will remain out of reach, for myriad reasons. Many warn that space weapons will be technologically daunting and cost-prohibitive, while alienating nations allied to the United States and antagonizing others. These ﬁve scenarios attempt to explain a different, complicated idea: In a world with space weapons, the United States may be better armed, but we may well be less secure. • Scenario 1 argues that U.S. anti-satellite (ASAT) programs are likely to inspire and aid the ASAT programs of others. In a world where many states have ASATs, the United States, which is heavily dependent on space systems, has the most to lose. • Scenario 2 argues that the tremendous value provided by space-based military systems is also very vulnerable to attack, creating perverse incentives for a U.S. president to rapidly escalate conﬂict in a crisis situation. • Scenario 3 argues that Russia and China are likely to change their nuclear postures in response to expanding U.S. military capabilities in outer space, increasing the readiness of their forces at the expense of operational control, and undermining years of efforts at risk reduction. • Scenario 4 argues that the space-enabled war-ﬁghting strategies tangle nuclear and space forces together in a way that creates unnecessary risks of accident – such as a piece of space debris striking a Russian early-warning satellite that could be interpreted as an attack. • Scenario 5 considers the possibility of conﬂicts that escalate into space, threatening American space assets through collateral damage, even if the United States is a third party.<br />

This is the second of two scenarios that consider how U.S. space weapons might create incentives for America’s opponents to behave in dangerous ways. The previous scenario looked at the systemic risk of accidents that could arise from keeping nuclear weapons on high alert to guard against a space weapons attack. This section focuses on the risk that a single accident in space, such as a piece of space debris striking a Russian early-warning satellite, might be the catalyst for an accidental nuclear war. As we have noted in an earlier section, the United States canceled its own ASAT program in the 1980s over concerns that the deployment of these weapons might be deeply destabilizing. For all the talk about a “new relationship” between the United States and Russia, both sides retain thousands of nuclear forces on alert and conﬁgured to ﬁght a nuclear war. When briefed about the size and status of U.S. nuclear forces, President George W. Bush reportedly asked “What do we need all these weapons for?” 43 The answer, as it was during the Cold War, is that the forces remain on alert to conduct a number of possible contingencies, including a nuclear strike against Russia. This fact, of course, is not lost on the Russian leadership, which has been increasing its reliance on nuclear weapons to compensate for the country’s declining military might. In the mid-1990s, Russia dropped its pledge to refrain from the “ﬁrst use” of nuclear weapons and conducted a series of exercises in which Russian nuclear forces prepared to use nuclear weapons to repel a NATO invasion. In October 2003, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov reiterated that Moscow might use nuclear weapons “preemptively” in any number of contingencies, including a NATO attack. 44<br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">As Kevin Narizny points out in his study of grand strategy, political turnover in the executive office often leads to dramatic shifts in state behavior. In particular, changes in control of government from one party to another can lead states to redefine their strategic goals and the means of promoting them.40 The profound and ongoing strategic adjustment by the Obama administration has indeed borne out this argument. The much-maligned grand strategy of primacy and unilateralism has given way to a new stance that emphasizes strategic restraint and multilateral diplomacy. Smart power, rather than military preponderance, is now seen by many as the best way to pursue U.S. interests in the world. The current strategic adjustment by the U.S. has significantly lowered China’s traditional concern about the threat posed by a hegemonic America. China’s foreign policy analysts have reached a consensus that the U.S. has suffered a significant relative decline and is in the process of strategic retreat. 41 As a result, the old hegemonic system is believed to have disintegrated. This new perception of the U.S. position in the world has also led the PLA to reassess the likelihood of war between the two countries. Some Chinese military strategists now believe that the relative decline of the U.S. has critically affected the ability and will of the American military to engage in major foreign wars. Lei Sihai, a strategist with a PLA background, claims that “the military capability of the U.S. has declined significantly and it is no longer capable of launching major wars.”42 Major General Jin Yinan, a strategist at the PLA National Defense University, has suggested that the rise of China and the relative decline of the U.S. have made a war scenario between them very unlikely.43 Thus, the strategic landscape between China and the U.S., as seen by Chinese experts from both civilian and military backgrounds, has shifted because of changes in American grand strategy and military strategy. This change in perception has relaxed Chinese concerns about national security. It marks a significant turnaround from China’s view of the American threat from the mid-1990s to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, when the American pursuit of hegemony was seen as the greatest threat in China’s strategic environment.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">For fortress America, embracing space collaboration with China would also incur domestic political risks. In the current political climate, military unilateralism and superiority, however questionable or counter-productive, is the politically safer approach to national security. For China, the prevailing worldview sees a superpower striving for absolute security, a quest driven by fear or hegemonic ambitions that are impervious to reason. U.S. space policy might be the best illustration of America’s drive for security at the expense of others’ security. China’s fear of becoming contained and ‘encircled’ by a hegemonic state and its allies is constant. Through the eyes of the Chinese military, space is the heart of an ongoing revolution in military affairs and has demonstrably served this ‘containment’ stratagem of the United States. The United States has enforced an unprecedented ban on exporting any space-related technology and commodities to China since 1999, but has steadfastly refused to have any meaningful dialogue with China either through an international forum or bilateral channels. This comprehensive isolation of China’s space program confirms the belief and fear of many Chinese military strategists that the United States seeks to arrest China’s progress in space in order to thwart its ability to revolutionize its warfighting technologies and win on the high-tech battlefields of the future. A zero-sum mindset toward space is hardening in China as a result of this apprehension, as amply illustrated in the public media. Space is eyed in China as an area of resources and possibilities to be acquired before it’s too late. Shu Xing, whose book is reviewed later in this journal, likens the grabbing of satellite orbits to the “Enclosure Movement” in late 18 th Century England in which the more capability one has, the more resources one can seize. Another reviewed author argued that countries scramble into space to fight for the tremendous resources found there and “once this fight for resources causes irreconcilable conflicts, it may lead to radical space confrontations.” A space war seems to many Chinese to be another form of resource war. Such urgency in seeking control over resources is not unique to space, but also applies to energy and other areas. Given China’s population and rapid economic growth, controlling resources is understandably a paramount concern. Regarding space, however, a zero-sum (‘win-lose’) attitude is narrow-minded and misguided. If feverish competition for resources in space causes Sino-American relations to deteriorate or leads to the outbreak of war between them, then both parties lose.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the US and China has now ended with the establishment of a felicitous new atmosphere between the two countries. But how can this “love-in” be made concrete? The most logical and potentially fruitful area of collaboration is climate change. Here, the two US government officials best equipped to lead are Secretary of Energy Steven Chu () and Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke. Chu is a former Berkeley and Stanford professor of physics and head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, while Locke is a former Washington State governor and a long-time supporter of US-China commercial exchanges. Each packs the kind of soft, utilitarian powers of persuasion that Chinese leaders are most willing to embrace: academic degrees from prestigious universities, advanced scientific and technological knowledge, high office and a Nobel Prize. (Chu is one of five ethnic Chinese to have won a Nobel, although no winner has yet come from the People’s Republic of China, a fact that gnaws at Chinese pride.) China’s press was abuzz over Chu and Locke, the first ethnic Chinese men to become US Cabinet secretaries. Most major Chinese papers ran Chu’s photo on the front page, with Beijing Business Today running a cautionary headline: “Don’t Mistake the Visiting American Ministers as Relatives!” The paper went on to warn that, “In their own hearts, we are afraid that Chu and Locke put their priorities in exactly the opposite order.” When Chu gave speeches on energy and climate change at Tsinghua University, China’s most elite institution for science and engineering (where his parents had been students), and then at Tianjin University (where his grandfather was once president), he was received with enormous enthusiasm, overflow crowds and standing ovations. So, the Chinese ended up embracing Chu and Locke in contradictory ways: as high-ranking representatives of the US government and as compatriots with whom they share the common bond of Chinese-ness. Both Chu and Locke are aware that the US and China are now the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, and that, if there is any hope of remedying global climate change, the two countries must quickly find a way to collaborate. Chu emphasized this point in his Tsinghua speech, calling the global climate situation “very disturbing,” and stressing that we were “all in it together.” “The developed world did make the problem … I admit that,” he acknowledged to his rapt audience. “But the developing world can make it much worse.” In announcing a new Sino-US joint research effort, Chu described clean energy as “one of the great opportunities of our time” for Sino-US cooperation, saying that by “working together, we can accomplish more than [by] acting alone.” Still, one is left to wonder if this new collaborative bonhomie and ethnic bonding will prove strong enough to cut through not only the long history of distrustful interactions between the US and China, but also the destabilizing effects of China’s sudden economic rise? For, although the US has drawn strength from the ideal of a “melting pot” — and US President Barack Obama’s Cabinet does represent a new high-water mark for diversity — Americans have often shown a xenophobic distrust of immigrants who have drawn too close to power. Especially in the case of Chinese, fears of divided national loyalties and “fifth columns” have been strong. One need only recall the recent case of Lee Wen-ho (), the Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist who was unjustly accused of spying, to be reminded of how yin and yang are the US’ feelings about minority members in sensitive positions. There is a second obstruction as well: the US Congress refuses to face up realistically to the climate challenge, because China, as a developing country, is not obliged to accept compulsory carbon limits. Then, because the US refuses to take responsibility for its cumulative and per capita greenhouse-gas emissions — which are, respectively, roughly four and three times greater than China’s — the Chinese leadership refuses to make concessions. A standoff ensues, which is where we are now. China recently demanded that the US reduce its emissions by 40 percent from its 1990 baseline levels and subsidize emission reduction efforts in China and other developing countries to the tune of 0.05 percent to 1 percent of the US’ GDP. But the recently House-passed Waxman-Markey bill proposes that the US only cut emissions by 3.6 percent of 1990 baseline levels. So it is still far from clear what will actually work to bring about an understanding between the US and China that produces real results. Moreover, with India poking Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in the eye over her climate-change entreaties, the world could easily see an even more unified and unyielding bloc emerge among developing countries. The next moment to watch is Obama’s trip to China in November. Here, if all the expressions of good feeling cannot be made concrete, an incomparable opportunity to recast Sino-US relations around the issue of climate change will have been lost.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The hour is late. Leading climate scientists such as James Hansen are literally shouting at the top of their lungs that the world needs to reduce emissions by 20-40% as soon as possible, and 80-90% by the year 2050, if we are to avoid climate chaos, crop failures, endless wars, melting of the polar icecaps, and a disastrous rise in ocean levels. Either we radically reduce CO2 and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e, which includes all GHGs, not just CO2) pollutants (currently at 390 parts per million and rising 2 ppm per year) to 350 ppm, including agriculture-derived methane and nitrous oxide pollution, or else survival for the present and future generations is in jeopardy. As scientists warned at Copenhagen, business as usual and a corresponding 7-8.6 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures means that the carrying capacity of the Earth in 2100 will be reduced to one billion people. Under this hellish scenario, billions will die of thirst, cold, heat, disease, war, and starvation. If the U.S. significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, other countries will follow. One hopeful sign is the recent EPA announcement that it intends to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Unfortunately we are going to have to put tremendous pressure on elected public officials to force the EPA to crack down on GHG polluters (including industrial farms and food processors). Public pressure is especially critical since &quot;just say no&quot; Congressmen-both Democrats and Republicans-along with agribusiness, real estate developers, the construction industry, and the fossil fuel lobby appear determined to maintain &quot;business as usual.&quot;</span><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said Monday talks on passing free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama are focused on the Senate, where the administration hopes to renew funding for a job-retraining program. The timing of any votes on the three trade pacts will depend on how soon a deal can be reached to pass the retraining program, known as Trade Adjustment Assistance, he said. &quot;We're continuing to work so we can get TAA done and move forward with the FTAs,&quot; Mr. Kirk told reporters on the sidelines of a conference. When asked whether a failure to pass the trade pacts by the time President Barack Obama hosts Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders in November, Mr. Kirk said the administration is &quot;more optimistic than that.&quot; However, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), the top Republican on the Finance Committee, called for Mr. Obama to send up the pacts immediately. &quot;I simply cannot understand the president's continued delay,&quot; Mr. Hatch said in opening remarks for a hearing to consider several trade nominees. &quot;I am confident that, once the president submits these agreements, they will pass Congress with broad bipartisan support.&quot; Committee Chairman Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.) said Trade Adjustment Assistance must be passed with the trade deals to ensure that opening markets overseas is done in a way that &quot;puts American jobs first&quot; Congress finally began making progress toward passing the Bush-era trade deals last week, when the House passed a tariff bill that is expected to serve as the vehicle to renew TAA. The Obama administration has insisted that a scaled-back version of the retraining program—at about half the level of funding—be passed alongside the three pacts. Under a bipartisan deal being worked out to ensure that both the trade agreements and job-retraining program move together, the Senate is now expected to attach TAA to the House-passed bill to renew the Generalized System of Preferences program, which gives duty-free access for imports from developing countries. The Senate isn't expected to take up the bill until next week at the earliest, and then send it back to the House. Once the administration submits the free-trade agreements for an up-or-down vote, the House would hold separate votes on the three trade pacts and the bill combining the duty-free and job-retraining programs, according to congressional aides, who cautioned that some details of the sequencing of votes still need to be ironed out.</span></em><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">What's more, the fate of the pact has national security implications, says Brian Pomper, a partner at the Akin Gump law firm in Washington, D.C. and a former trade counsel for Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee. With a nuclear-armed North Korea once more threatening military conflict, &quot;some may wonder how can the United States give South Korea a stiff arm&quot; by rejecting the deal? South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak has been widely criticized at home for his weak and indecisive response to a recent artillery attack by North Korea. If Congress rejects the deal, it will be a slap in Lee's face. So beyond economic considerations, Pomper says, &quot;this [deal] is the sort of symbol of U.S. leadership in Asia that many other countries -- who are looking at China with a nervous eye -- have been [seeking]. It is reasserting American interests in Asia. The President has put his reputation on the line.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">But is there, in fact, sufficient political support for such a pact in the United States? Will Democrats, independents and Tea Party followers suspicious of globalization oppose the pact because of their ideological objections, or fears that their constituents will hold it against them in the 2012 elections? Although the new text of the Korea pact won quick approval from the United Auto Workers union -- because it eliminates tariff and non-tariff barriers to U.S. auto exports to South Korea -- it was quickly rejected by Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. Trumka argues that the agreement's provisions for investment and government procurement &quot;will encourage off-shoring&quot; by multinationals rather than maximize opportunities for U.S. job growth. Even under the revised treaty, both U.S. and South Korean workers would &quot;continue to face repeated challenges to their exercise of fundamental human rights on the job -- especially freedom of association and the right to organize and bargain collectively,&quot; he adds. Pomper says many Americans tell pollsters they support stronger exports, but they don't necessarily link such a desire to bilateral or multilateral agreements that improve access to foreign markets. In other words, exports are not automatically linked with job growth in the U.S. mindset. Lately, the tide of public opinion has been turning even further against free-trade pacts among many independents and conservatives who traditionally back other kinds of initiatives -- such as lower corporate and individual tax rates -- that expand opportunities for businesses. Free traders have reportedly done a poor job of explaining how these pacts can promote U.S. jobs by opening up markets. That's the key connection that supporters are promising to make this time around. One such supporter is Frank Vargo, vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), who notes that manufacturing exports to South Korea supported 230,000 American jobs in 2008, the last year for which statistics are available. And that's, of course, before the new pact adds to the export flow. Vargo and other supporters have a lot of work to do. For one thing, not everyone believes in such numbers. In a recent Pew Research Center poll, &quot;two-thirds of Tea Party people say that free-trade agreements lead to job losses, and this belief is starting to affect the Republican Party,&quot; says Pomper. &quot;The Tea Party is a form of populism, and I am nervous that this view will start to filter up.&quot; More broadly, most Americans tell pollsters that trade is fine when it is with countries that are widely viewed as friendly, but not necessarily with others. In the Pew poll, 76% of the respondents said they favored trade with Canada and rated that country highest as a trading partner. More than 50% of respondents were also positive about the benefits of trading with Brazil, the European Union and Japan. But fewer than half of the respondents -- only 45% -- had a positive view of trade with China and South Korea. Why were so few Americans positive about South Korea, a longtime military ally of the United States? Pomper says pollsters believe the explanation is that &quot;many Americans are geographically challenged,&quot; confusing South Korea with North Korea, which attracts a lot more attention in the mainstream media. Overall, only 33% of the respondents said that trade agreements have been &quot;good for the U.S.&quot; Some 44% were opposed to them, and 46% said that they had been hurt personally by the agreements. In the October Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll, 53% of respondents said that free-trade agreements have hurt the country, up from 46% in 2007 and only 32% in 1999. Even very-well-educated, upper-income people are now more likely to oppose free trade, according to the poll. Among those earning $75,000 or more, 50% said that free-trade pacts have hurt the United States, up from 24% in 1999. The Tea Party Factor During the fall election season, some Democratic and Republican candidates sought to leverage widespread xenophobia and fear of globalization by suggesting that their opponents had supported free-trade measures that wound up &quot;exporting jobs&quot; to China. David Spooner, a former U.S. trade negotiator who is now an attorney at Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey in Washington, D.C., believes, however, that both parties had only limited success with such appeals. Spooner, a Republican, notes that Republican Rob Portman, the U.S. Trade Representative under President Bush, won his race for an Ohio Senate seat by a wide margin despite the fact that his opponent hammered away that Portman, during his tenure as Trade Representative, had supposedly sold out U.S. manufacturing jobs to China. With Portman now in the Senate and other pro-trade Republicans in key positions -- such as new Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Majority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia -- it is tempting to believe that both the House and the Senate will quickly push through the Korea agreement and then move on to Colombia, Panama and other trade pacts. But everything hinges on the ability of the President to assert his leadership on the Korea deal. &quot;The President has demonstrated leadership,&quot; says Dittrich, &quot;and we have no reason to think that he won't continue to do so.&quot; The battle over the Korea agreement seems likely to pit Obama on one side -- along with pro-trade Republicans. On the other side will be anti-trade Democrats and Tea Party Republicans.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">At worst, there is the possibility of nuclear attack1, whether by intention, miscalculation, or merely accident, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions. But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger…To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4 These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. The direct impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis pale by comparison. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community.</span><br />

<em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Alternatively, the United States can declare a space race, unilaterally announcing a long-awaited manned program to return to the Moon and/or a manned Mars mission. However, the International Space Station (ISS) partners, especially Russia and Europe, are unlikely to support a program developed without their input or one that excludes the Chinese. Further, the continuing financial and technical problems with the still-incomplete ISS make it unlikely that they would be anxious to commit, even if invited, to an expanded manned program. So if the US were to start another space race, it would likely be going it alone. Domestically, a competitive approach would accrue benefits to the US like those enjoyed during the Apollo program, including prestige, technology development, and jobs. Strategically, at the risk of otherwise losing face and allowing the technology gap to grow, China would be pushed toward increased spending on its manned program and at a faster pace than they would otherwise choose. That would divert funds from Chinese military programs and potentially cause China substantial economic hardship, similar to what happened when the Soviet Union felt compelled to spend money countering Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) technology. But there are three critical uncertainties that would make initiating a space race an unwise move - whether the US can afford an independent program and maintain the requisite political will to fund it through completion; whether it is really the best long-term strategy for long-term US-China relations; and whether the US can afford to reinforce further the view that it prefers unilateralism to multilateralism - in any realm of international relations.</span></em><br />

That would send Singapore and Malaysia- once occupied by Japan- into nervous breakdowns. Meanwhile, India might make a grab for Tibet, and Pakistan for Kashmir.

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The third alternative focuses on cooperation. The US has a long and successful tradition of international cooperation in space. Especially in the areas of space science and environmental monitoring, the US has historically viewed space as an opportunity to build bridges with countries while simultaneously co-opting them into working on areas of our choice, rather than areas not to our liking. Cooperation is clearly the better option with China, too. The US could start slowly, rewarding Beijing for reciprocity and transparency by granting China an increasingly larger role in a joint program of manned exploration and development. Specifically, a US proposal to multilaterally review and expand the future of manned space exploration - from the ISS to another lunar voyage or even a Mars mission - on an incremental, inclusive basis would allow Washington to revitalize American space leadership. Crucially, it would also give the US a means to influence the future direction of the Chinese space program. This option would counter the prevailing view of the US as a unilateralist hegemon and allow for a focus on infrastructure development that does not require unrealistic budget burdens. While there is the risk of international politics intruding into the process over time, that is counterbalanced by the vested interest such a program would give participants in system stability. To be sure, there would be resistance to working with China. Washington is replete with individuals adamantly objecting to cooperation with China on grounds from human rights to its status as the largest remaining communist country. Isolating China, however, is increasingly a stance counterproductive to US interests, as a world without China is simply not possible. US and Chinese interests frequently overlap, on North Korea and the Global War on Terror, for example, not to mention economics. The United States has a window of opportunity to step in and use space cooperation to its advantage. Because space is considered so critical to the futures of both the US and China, any activity by one has been considered zero-sum by the other, triggering an action-reaction cycle and threatening escalation into an arms race of technology and countermeasure development. That direction can be changed. A inclusive vision will give the US an opportunity to assume the mantle of leadership on a mission that could inspire the world and shift Chinese activities into areas more compatible with US interests. On the geostrategic Wei Qi board, cooperation is the best &quot;next move&quot; for the US.</span><br />

<em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The U.S. Coast Guard is funded by a mix of direct tax support and fees collected for services, such as boat registration. The Space Guard could be funded similarly. A fee could be charged to the launching nation for each satellite placed in an orbit serviced by the Space Guard. It could also charge fees (if approved in advance by treaty) to nations whose spacecraft are helped in time of distress. The Teal Group forecast assumed 1,447 satellites over 8 years, an annual rate of about 180. A $25M budget divided by 180 would give a fee of $138,888. This seems unpalatable, especially since GEO satellites would receive little direct benefit (although all satellites benefit indirectly by the enforcement of space treaties), so some level of funding by participating governments would be needed to keep this down. Since the Space Guard would also serve the higher purposes of treaty enforcement and protect the gigantic international investment in the ISS, such funding seems appropriate. Funding the Space Guard may turn out to be the cheapest way for satellite owners to meet future requirements preventing orbital debris. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee is discussing guidelines requiring satellite owners to remove satellites (either by orbit-raising or de-orbiting) from heavily used orbits. An official with the French space agency, CNES, has objected this is a very expensive proposition, requiring perhaps 150kg of fuel.17 Leaving aside the cost of designing and installing larger fuel tanks (or using existing tanks and accepting a shorter useful lifespan, which is even less appealing), just placing an extra 150kg into orbit, using a common rule of $10K per kilogram, adds up to $1.5M per satellite. There is no mandatory rule so far requiring this capability, but it's an issue to keep in mind. Paying fees to support the Space Guard or paying the Guard directly each time a satellite is removed would be attractive options compared to building such capability into every satellite launched.</span></em><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">a. Budget stress. The manner in which Congress and Administrations allocate budget resources reflects the larger political preferences of the parties and factions controlling both bodies. In times when factions favoring defense expenditure over social expenditure control one or both branches, budget supplicants seek to find defense rationales for projects; thus both the Interstate Highway System and the national student loan program initially had the word &quot;Defense&quot; in their titles. Later, these terms were dropped to stress the civil aspect of their applications more strongly. The word &quot;Defense&quot; has appeared and disappeared from the title of the (Defense) Advanced Research Projects Agency with the change of administrations. The current Administration and Congress tend to favor civil over defense expenditure. A Space Guard in (for purposes of discussion) the Department of Transportation would move a substantial bloc of funding from DOD to a civil agency, which would allow DOD to represent it as a &quot;defense cut&quot; while still enjoying access to the functionalities it would provide. As McKinley pointed out, space support currently represents a substantial portion of inflexible, &quot;must fund&quot; resource commitments of the USAF that do not contribute directly to warfighting operations. The Navy has been comfortable with the Coast Guard and its predecessors from the beginning. It has found it useful to be able to draw on Coast Guard capabilities whenever they were needed, and having the luxury of ignoring it when they weren't. If the Air Force could be convinced that a similar relationship would be equally useful, they might switch from reflexive opposition to support</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">This “fair share” argument is at least more sober than phony “cut defense or kill the economy” sensationalism, and it has the appearance of reasonableness. But it is still based on a fallacy. Distributing cuts equally is not an intrinsically good thing. If you wanted to reduce the gas consumption of your gas-guzzling car by 10 percent, you wouldn’t remove 10 percent of your front and rear bumpers so that all parts of the car shared the pain. The same goes for the federal budget. Not all cuts have equal effect on the national well-being. Few would propose cutting spending on airport security, for instance. At a time of elevated risk of terrorist attack, we don’t need to show the American people that airport security is contributing its “fair share” to budget reduction. Today the international situation is also one of high risk. • The terrorists who would like to kill Americans on U.S. soil constantly search for safe havens from which to plan and carry out their attacks. American military actions in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen, and elsewhere make it harder for them to strike and are a large part of the reason why for almost a decade there has been no repetition of September 11. To the degree that we limit our ability to deny them safe haven, we increase the chances they will succeed. • American forces deployed in East Asia and the Western Pacific have for decades prevented the outbreak of major war, provided stability, and kept open international trading routes, making possible an unprecedented era of growth and prosperity for Asians and Americans alike. Now the United States faces a new challenge and potential threat from a rising China which seeks eventually to push the U.S. military’s area of operations back to Hawaii and exercise hegemony over the world’s most rapidly growing economies. Meanwhile, a nuclear-armed North Korea threatens war with South Korea and fires ballistic missiles over Japan that will someday be capable of reaching the west coast of the United States. Democratic nations in the region, worried that the United States may be losing influence, turn to Washington for reassurance that the U.S. security guarantee remains firm. If the United States cannot provide that assurance because it is cutting back its military capabilities, they will have to choose between accepting Chinese dominance and striking out on their own, possibly by building nuclear weapons. • In the Middle East, Iran seeks to build its own nuclear arsenal, supports armed radical Islamic groups in Lebanon and Palestine, and has linked up with anti-American dictatorships in the Western Hemisphere. The prospects of new instability in the region grow every day as a decrepit regime in Egypt clings to power, crushes all moderate opposition, and drives the Muslim Brotherhood into the streets. A nuclear-armed Pakistan seems to be ever on the brink of collapse into anarchy and radicalism. Turkey, once an ally, now seems bent on an increasingly anti-American Islamist course. The prospect of war between Hezbollah and Israel grows, and with it the possibility of war between Israel and Syria and possibly Iran. There, too, nations in the region increasingly look to Washington for reassurance, and if they decide the United States cannot be relied upon they will have to decide whether to succumb to Iranian influence or build their own nuclear weapons to resist it. In the 1990s, after the Soviet Union had collapsed and the biggest problem in the world seemed to be ethnic conflict in the Balkans, it was at least plausible to talk about cutting back on American military capabilities. In the present, increasingly dangerous international environment, in which terrorism and great power rivalry vie as the greatest threat to American security and interests, cutting military capacities is simply reckless. Would we increase the risk of strategic failure in an already risky world, despite the near irrelevance of the defense budget to American fiscal health, just so we could tell American voters that their military had suffered its “fair share” of the pain? The nature of the risk becomes plain when one considers the nature of the cuts that would have to be made to have even a marginal effect on the U.S. fiscal crisis. Many are under the illusion, for instance, that if the United States simply withdrew from Iraq and Afghanistan and didn’t intervene anywhere else for a while, this would have a significant impact on future deficits. But, in fact, projections of future massive deficits already assume the winding down of these interventions.Withdrawal from the two wars would scarcely make a dent in the fiscal crisis. Nor can meaningful reductions be achieved by cutting back on waste at the Pentagon—which Secretary of Defense Gates has already begun to do and which has also been factored into deficit projections. If the United States withdrew from Iran and Afghanistan tomorrow, cut all the waste Gates can find, and even eliminated a few weapons programs—all this together would still not produce a 10 percent decrease in overall defense spending. In fact, the only way to get significant savings from the defense budget—and by “significant,” we are still talking about a tiny fraction of the cuts needed to bring down future deficits—is to cut force structure: fewer troops on the ground; fewer airplanes in the skies; fewer ships in the water; fewer soldiers, pilots, and sailors to feed and clothe and provide benefits for. To cut the size of the force, however, requires reducing or eliminating the missions those forces have been performing. Of course, there are any number of think tank experts who insist U.S. forces can be cut by a quarter or third or even by half and still perform those missions. But this is snake oil. Over the past two decades, the force has already been cut by a third. Yet no administration has reduced the missions that the larger force structures of the past were designed to meet. To fulfill existing security commitments, to remain the “world’s power balancer of choice,” as Leslie Gelb puts it, to act as “the only regional balancer against China in Asia, Russia in eastern Europe, and Iran in the Middle East” requires at least the current force structure, and almost certainly more than current force levels. Those who recommend doing the same with less are only proposing a policy of insufficiency, where the United States makes commitments it cannot meet except at high risk of failure. The only way to find substantial savings in the defense budget, therefore, is to change American strategy fundamentally. The Simpson-Bowles commission suggests as much, by calling for a reexamination of America’s “21st century role,” although it doesn’t begin to define what that new role might be. Others have. For decades “realist” analysts have called for a strategy of “offshore balancing.” Instead of the United States providing security in East Asia and the Persian Gulf, it would withdraw its forces from Japan, South Korea, and the Middle East and let the nations in those regions balance one another. If the balance broke down and war erupted, the United States would then intervene militarily until balance was restored. In the Middle East and Persian Gulf, for instance, Christopher Layne has long proposed “passing the mantle of regional stabilizer” to a consortium of “Russia, China, Iran, and India.” In East Asia offshore balancing would mean letting China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and others manage their own problems, without U.S. involvement—again, until the balance broke down and war erupted, at which point the United States would provide assistance to restore the balance and then, if necessary, intervene with its own forces to restore peace and stability. Before examining whether this would be a wise strategy, it is important to understand that this really is the only genuine alternative to the one the United States has pursued for the past 65 years. To their credit, Layne and others who support the concept of offshore balancing have eschewed halfway measures and airy assurances that we can do more with less, which are likely recipes for disaster. They recognize that either the United States is actively involved in providing security and stability in regions beyond the Western Hemisphere, which means maintaining a robust presence in those regions, or it is not. Layne and others are frank in calling for an end to the global security strategy developed in the aftermath of World War II, perpetuated through the Cold War, and continued by four successive post-Cold War administrations.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The central aim of this paper is to show how a dominant US discourse of technological, military and commercial superiority configures and prescribes success and successful behaviour in the politics of outer space in particularly gendered forms. US space discourse is predicated on a heteronormative discourse that (re)produces the dominance of heterosexual masculinity(ies), and which hierarchically orders the construction of other (subordinate) gender identities. As a particularly dominant discursive arrangement of outer space politics, US space discourse (re)produces meaning through the gendered assumptions of exploration, colonisation, economic endeavour and military conquest that are deeply gendered whilst presented as universal and neutral. Outer space is both a conceptual, political and material space, a place for collisions and collusions (literally and metaphorically) between objects, ideas, identities and discourses. Outer space, like international relations, is a global space always socially and locally embedded. There is nothing ‘out there’ about outer space. It exists because of us, not in spite of us, and it is this that means that it only makes sense in social terms, that is, in relation to our own constructions of identity and social location. In this paper, outer space is the problematic to which I apply a gender analysis, an arena wherein past, current and future policy making is embedded in relation to certain performances of power and reconfigurations of identity that are always, and not incidentally, gendered. Effective and appropriate behaviour in the politics of outer space is configured and prescribed in particularly gendered, neoliberalized forms. It is gender that brings to outer space’s hierarchies of technologically superior, conquesting performance their everyday power, and it is through gender that US techno-strategic and astro-political discourse has been able to (re)produce outer space as a heterosexualized, masculinized realm.This paper is about sex, but not the sex that people already ‘have clarity about’. To talk about ‘sex in public’ is not purely to limit discussion to sex acts, or sexual identities in the usual sense; it is to talk about ‘sex as it is mediated by publics’, some of whose obvious relation to sex may be obscure (Berlant and Warner, 1998: 547). Outer space as a human, public domain is organized around sex, but this is ‘sex’ that is tacitly located, and rarely spoken, in official US discourse. The politics of space, as conceived of and practised in the US, embody a distinction between public and private (and appropriate behaviours, meanings and identities therein) that is highly dependent upon heteronormative hierarchies of property and propriety. A dominant, US-led discourse of Outer Space is thus formed from and upon institutions, structures of understanding, and practical orientations that privilege and normalize heterosexuality as universal. As Bedford argues, using sexuality as an analytical concept extends beyond discussion of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues to consider the ways in which heterosexuality as ‘unmarked’ (that is, thoroughly normalized) is (re)produced in changing forms by political actors (2005: 296). As such, the dominant discursive rationalisations of outer space exploration and conquest both constitute space as heterosexual, and (re)produce the heterosexual imperatives that constitute suitable space-able people, practices and behaviours. The central aim of this paper is to show how a dominant US discourse of technological, military and commercial superiority configures and prescribes success and successful behaviour in the politics of outer space in particularly gendered forms. US space discourse is predicated on a heteronormative discourse that (re)produces the dominance of heterosexual masculinity(ies), and which hierarchically orders the construction of other (subordinate) gender identities. As a particularly dominant discursive arrangement of outer space politics, US space discourse (re)produces meaning through the gendered assumptions of exploration, colonisation, economic endeavour and military conquest that are deeply gendered whilst presented as universal and neutral. It is worth considering how, and according to what political ideology, US political discourse constitutes space. Thus, while it is true that a particularly insidious neoliberal globalisation thesis does indeed drive much of US space discourse (dependent on the expansion of the free market into all areas of social life), space is rarely only conceived of in commercial terms in the US. As such, neoliberal, commercial imperatives, together with various narratives of scientific ‘progress’ and ‘discovery’, also interact in US political culture with a highly militaristic and imperial discourse of weaponization, territorial conquest and securitization. Herein, important performances of gendered identity construct specific, tacitly gendered, rationalisations of outer space exploration and colonisation in particular ways. Specifically, this involves highly masculinized performances of so-called techno-wizardry, speed, proliferation and investment that construct space as a frontier to be conquered, controlled and colonized through scientific, commercial and/or military prowess. Through gendered, discursive constructions of technologically superior, conquesting performance, the dominant (US) discourse of outer space thus (re)produces space as the arena of the ultimate conquest of heterosexual man over nature, an arena dependent on. This paper examines outer space as a discursive realm, articulating identities, behaviours and meanings in particular, gendered, ways. Discourses are, as Derrida suggests, historically dependent systems of signification and are intrinsically (re)productive (Derrida 2001, 3). Discourses, as (re)productive systems of meaningful practices, form the identities of subjects and objects, and are composed of a multitude of practices, institutions, identities, norms, rules and disciplinary procedures. These systems are material and heterogeneous in nature (Best and Kellner 1991, 26), and carry their meanings and modes of representation through discursive practices. This paper offers an analysis of US outer space discourse as a constructed, and thus potentially unstable, arrangements of identity. US space discourse constitutes an exceptionally powerful, but not unchallenged, arrangement of identities, practices, norms and processes, embodying tacit, but crucial, gendered and sexualized assumptions. Space, as a discursive realm, cannot be considered ‘extraterrestrial’ in any traditional sense. Outer space may, physically, exist somewhere beyond the Earth’s terrestrial atmosphere, but the politics of outer space are invariably Earth-bound. Global outer space politics, although involving a multitude of actors, organisations, state and non-state-based articulations, is currently dominated by a US-led ‘liberal’ discourse of military, commercial and scientific conquest that draws heavily from essentialist and foundational ideologies of nature, civilization, science, progress and consumption. Crawford, in proposing a case for the ‘scientific and social’ importance of human space exploration, suggests that, [T]here are reasons for believing that as a species Homo sapiens is genetically predisposed towards exploration and the colonisation of an open frontier. Access to such a frontier, at least vicariously, may be in some sense psychologically necessary for the long-term wellbeing of human societies. (Crawford, 2005: 260)Similarly, NASA’s website claims that ‘[f]rom the time of our birth, humans have felt a primordial urge to explore,’ to ‘blaze new trails, map new lands, and answer profound questions about ourselves and our universe’ (www.nasa.gov). This remark, along with others such as Crawford’s, presents a vision of the human colonisation of Outer Space as both natural and essential to humanity, a ‘psychological and cultural requirement’ that is not merely a ‘Western predisposition’, but ‘a human one’ (Crawford, 2005: 260). By their very nature, such statements are founded on a definition of ‘universal’ human society entirely Western in origin, dependent on the kind of ‘modern, knowledge-based economy’ that the US has sought to establish through technological, military and commercial expansion. Although the ‘we’ in much US space discourse is meant as universal, in reality it is a highly singular and culturally specific construction of identity, one deeply embedded in the liberal belief that humanity needs ‘a sense of freedom’ and ‘choice’ (Seguin, 2005: 981); that it was ‘our’ grandparents who thought exploring Africa was an adventure (Mendell, 2005: 10), and not Africans themselves; that the ‘scientific revolution’ sprang from the ‘unusual pragmatic and classless entrepreneurship of US society’ that ‘promoted commercialisation and innovative marketing of new technology’ (ibid.).</span><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The first principle of the proposed feminist viewpoint concerning international relations is a comprehensive, rather than privileged, view of the factors to be taken into account when making international relations policy. The policy-making lens utilized by current decision-makers fails to utilize the peripheral vision necessary to see many of the world’s important political complexities. Rebecca Grant describes the picture that international relations theorists have concerning the international situation as incomplete. She explains that the world that the international relations theory community deals with is “a fragmentary and distorted version of the world.”3 This fragmentation stems from international preoccupation with issues of security and trade. The issues of security and trade are areas where values traditionally associated with masculinity pervade.4 J. Ann Tickner supports Grant’s interpretation of the scope of international relations theories’ evaluations as she calls the discipline “based on assumptions about human nature that privilege the masculine.”5 She relates international relations to masculinity as she recognizes the prevalent utilization of force in the international arena. Tickner’s idea of masculinity is not necessarily tied to the state of being a man. She discusses a concept of masculinity, where masculinity is another word for dominance, called masculine in opposition to femininity, which has been symbolic of weakness and subordination at many points in history. By masculine values, I mean that these are the values that are acted upon by the power establishment in the world of politics and political theory. The combination of the dominative connotation of the term ‘masculine’ and the fact that most politicians and many political theories do come to the table with the experience, vocabulary, and ideas of male-ness, insofar as social construction and social norms in this world differentiate the experience of male-ness and womynhood. Tickner goes on to present more evidence for the thesis of the masculinity of international relations practice by pointing out that the ways in which nations relate is often “described in the appropriate locker-room or football language.”6 This language includes ‘invading’ other nations, ‘raping’ natural resources, ‘dominating’ our enemies, ‘feminizing’ other cultures, heroism discourse, and ‘forcing’ behavioral choices. In the international community, words like ‘coercion’ and ‘leverage’ are thrown around more frequently than peace words, and normally have at least the threat of bite behind their bark. Grant and Newland describe the discourse and action of international relations as “narrow,” justifying their argument by recognizing that “excluded from that conception, quite comprehensively, is the experience of most women(sic).”7 The argument that wymyn’s experience is excluded from international relations dialogue is not the same as the argument that all men’s opinions and experiences are enfranchised. Instead, feminist international relations theory recognizes that it is not just the power inequality of gender, but the existence of power inequality, that creates subordination. Considering classism, racism, and sexism as a combination of subordinations of the ‘rest of society’ by the ‘elite,’ Jill Steans describes the world of international policy-making as a “partial reality filtered through the standpoints of some men.”8 Here she recognizes that international relations is privileging of the masculine, but qualifies that all men aren’t the ultimate beneficiaries of this male privilege. She also recognizes that there exists a white privilege, and a class privilege that influence male dominance to make it the dominance of ‘some men’ rather than of ‘all men.’ The elitism of the discourse of international relations makes J. Ann Tickner’s claim that “it is a discourse so far removed from politics and people” a logical conclusion.9 Postmodernist feminist scholarship has begun to construct a positive framework to address these difficulties through the rejection of totalizing discourses. Robert Keohane explains that “its [postmodern feminism’s] essence appears to be a resistance to the concept of one true story and to a ‘falsely universalizing perspective’ such as that of white men.”10 Esteva and Prakash outline their project as “abandoning projects to help or develop peoples at the grassroots, we invite others to learn from them the knowledge and sills required to survive and flourish beyond modernity.”11 While I will leave the issue of the relationship between postmodernism and feminism to a different composition, I believe that an ethic against patronization of the “womyn,” -Western,” guides a perspective concerning international relations informed by feminist theory. Current international relations theory has a limited scope, feminist international relations pays attention to that subject matter that tradition has limited out of the spectrum. The traditional framework, feminist authors argue, is not a set of ideas for feminists to work under and alter its effects, but one to be completely reworked due to its inadequacy. V. Spike Peterson and Anne Sisson Runyan argue that the feminist quest to reform international relations theory and praxis is “not about vanquishing and transcending according to the rules of the game, but about changing the game.”12 Changing the game, from a feminist standpoint, would entail a critical redefinition that broadened the scope of criterion for policy evaluation in international relations. While the experiences of some men are the current basis for the formulation of international relations policy, the experience of all people would be involved in making decisions, regardless of race, class, gender, or sexuality. A feminist epistemology of international relations would also undertake the task of reinterpreting the concept of power between nations. Feminist scholarship of gender relations has made progress in the area of redefining power between the genders, and feminist scholarship of international relations would take the same viewpoint towards power between nations. The current conception of power is that of ‘power-over;’ power is used for the purposes of manipulating the less powerful into compliance with the desires and/or interests of the more powerful. The United States having ‘the power to prevent the government of Serbia from invading Kosovo’ means that the United States will be able to pressure, persuade, leverage, or force the government of Serbia in order to get that government to comply with its demands. Power is thus a conflict-based concept, in that power is what an individual or state actor will use in order to either prevent a conflict or be victorious in a conflict. This view of power then prioritizes victory over compromise, and conquering over agreeing. This interpretation of power also necessitates that the power-seeker to choose her individual or state interests over the protection of others. In this way, power-over creates a self-other dichotomy that devalues the ‘other.’ The alternative to a conception of power that emphasizes dominance is a conception of power that emphasizes concert. Seeing power as the ability to act in concert privileges agreement, coalition-building, and egalitarian negotiation. Tickner explains “thinking about power in this multidimensional sense may help us to think constructively about the potential for cooperation as well as conflict, an aspect of international relations generally played down by realism.”13 If Tickner is right that the status quo downplays the concept of cooperation, then the political world could progress more towards ‘peace’ simply by inserting cooperation into the mix of political possibilities.</span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">In the order of reason which has governed Western thought since the rise of Ancient Greek philosophy, feminine otherness is denied and reconstituted as a male-defined otherness. This results in the denial of subjectivity to potentially non-male-defined women. A maternal feminine subjectivity, were it to be realized, would enable women to step outside of patriarchal definitions of the feminine and become subjects in their own right. Whereas the unconscious in Freud and Lacan lays claim to fixed universal status, for Irigaray its actual form and content is a product of history. Thus, however patriarchal the symbolic order may be in Lacan, it is open to change. The question is how this change might be brought about. For Irigaray, the key to change is the development of a female imaginary. This can only be achieved under patriarchy in a fragmented way, as what she terms the excess that is realized in margins of the dominant culture. The move towards a female imaginary would also entail the transformation of the symbolic, since the relationship between the two is one of mutual shaping. This would enable women to assume subjectivity in their own right. Although, for Irigaray, the imaginary and the symbolic are both historical and changeable, this does not mean that, after thousands of years of repression and exclusion, change is easy. In a move not unlike that of ecofeminists, Irigaray suggests that the symbolic order, men and masculinity are shaped by patriarchy in ways which are immensely problematic not just for women but also for the future of the planet. The apparently objective, gender-neutral discourses of science and philosophy — the discourses of a male subject — have led to the threat of global nuclear destruction. In An Ethics of Sexual Difference (1993; original 1984), Irigaray suggests that the patriarchal male subject is himself shaped by the loss of the maternal feminine which motivates a desire for mastery: Man's self-affect depends on the woman who has given him being and birth, who has born/e him, enveloped him, warmed him, fed him. Love of self would seemingly take the form of a long return to and through the other. A unique female other, who is forever lost and must be sought in many others, an infinite number of others. The distance for this return can be conquered by the transcendence of God. The (female) other who is sought and cherished may be assimilated to the unique god. The (female) other is mingled or confused with God or the gods. (Irigaray 1993: 60-1; original 1984) Irigaray takes this theme further in Thinking the Difference: For a Peaceful Revolution (1994; original 1989) when she suggests that the desire for godlike mastery and transcendence has dire consequences for the world: Huge amounts of capital are allocated to the development of death machines in order to ensure peace, we are told. This warlike method of organising society is not self-evident. It has its m origin in patriarchy. It has a sex. But the age of technology has given weapons of war a power that exceeds the conflicts and risks taken among patriarchs. Women, children, all living things, including elemental matter, are drawn into the maelstrom. And death and destruction cannot be associated solely with war. They are part of the physical and mental aggression to which we are constantly subjected. What we need is an overall cultural transformation. Mankind [le peuple des homines] wages war everywhere all the time with a perfectly clear conscience. Mankind is traditionally carnivorous, sometimes cannibalistic. So men must eat to kill, must increase their domination of nature in order to live or to survive, must seek on the most distant stars what no longer exists here, must defend by any means the small patch of land they are exploiting here or over there. Men always go further, exploit further, seize more, without really knowing where they are going. Men seek what they think they need without considering who they are and how their identity is defined by what they do. To overcome this ignorance, I think that mankind needs those who are persons in their own right to help them understand and find their limits. Only women can play this role. Women are not genuinely responsible subjects in the patriarchal community. That is why it may be possible for them to interpret this culture in which they have less involvement and fewer interests than do men, and of which they are not themselves products to the point where they have been blinded by it. Given their relative exclusion from society, women may, from their outside perspective, reflect back a more objective image of society than can men. (Irigaray 1994: 4—5; original 1989) The destructive force of the patriarchal symbolic order makes all the more pressing Irigaray's project of creating a female imaginary and symbolic, specific to women, which might in its turn transform the male-defined symbolic order in the West, in which women figure only as lesser men. In this process, separatism becomes a strategy in the struggle for a nonpatriarchal society in which sexual difference is both voiced and valued: Let women tacitly go on strike, avoid men long enough to learn to defend their desire notably by their speech, let them discover the love of other women protected from that imperious choice of men which puts them in a position of rival goods, let them forge a social status which demands recognition, let them earn their living in order to leave behind their condition of prostitute — these are certainly indispensable steps in their effort to escape their proletarianization on the trade market. But if their goal is to reverse the existing order - even if that were possible - history would simply repeat itself and return to phallocratism, where neither women's sex, their imaginary, nor their language can exist.

<em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Operationalized, the evidence of patriarchy as a dysfunctional system is found in the behaviors to which it gives rise, (c) the unmanageability, (d) which results. For example, in the United States, current estimates are that one out of every three or four women will be raped by someone she knows; globally, rape, sexual harassment, spouse-beating, and sado-massochistic pornography are examples of behaviors practiced, sanctioned, or tolerated within patriarchy. In the realm of environmentally destructive behaviors, strip-mining, factory farming, and pollution of the air, water, and soil are instances of behaviors maintained and sanctioned within patriarchy. They, too, rest on the faulty beliefs that it is okay to “rape the earth,” that it is “man’s God-given right” to have dominion (that is domination) over the earth, that nature has only instrumental value that environmental destruction is the acceptable price we pay for “progress.” And the presumption of warism, that war is a natural, righteous, and ordinary way to impose dominion on a people or nation, goes hand in hand with patriarchy and leads to dysfunctional behaviors of nations and ultimately to international unmanageability. Much of the current “unmanageability” of contemporary life in patriarchal societies, (d) is then viewed as a consequence of a patriarchal preoccupation with activities, events, and experiences that reflect historically male-gender-identified beliefs, values, attitudes, and assumptions. Included among these real-life consequences are precisely those concerns with nuclear proliferation, war, and environmental destruction, and violence towards women, which many feminists see as the logical outgrowth of patriarchal thinking. In fact, it is often only through observing these dysfunctional behaviors—the symptoms of dysfunctionality—that one can truly see that and how patriarchy serves to maintain and perpetuate them. When patriarchy is understood as a dysfunctional system, this “unmanageability” can be seen for what it is—as a predictable and thus logical consequence of patriarchy. The theme that global environmental crises, war, and violence generally are predictable and logical consequences of sexism and patriarchal culture is pervasive in ecofeminist literature. Ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak, for instance, argues that “a militarism and warfare are continual features of a patriarchal society because they reflect and instill patriarchal values and fulfill needs of such a system. Acknowledging the context of patriarchal conceptualizations that feed militarism is a first step toward reducing their impact and preserving life on Earth.” Stated in terms of the foregoing model of patriarchy as a dysfunctional social system, the claims by Spretnak and other feminists take on a clearer meaning: Patriarchal conceptual frameworks legitimate impaired thinking (about women, national and regional conflict, the environment) which is manifested in behaviors which, if continued, will make life on earth difficult, if not impossible. It is a stark message, but it is plausible. Its plausibility lies in understanding the conceptual roots of various woman-nature-peace connections in regional, national, and global contexts.</span></em><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">As the foregoing elaboration attests, the pressures and dynamics, the organizational processes which allowed Challenger to happen reflect the tragic triumph of a decidedly masculinist (and unfortunately pervasive) managerial mindset. We have seen how the processes and actions which contributed to what the Presidential Commission referred to as “the flawed decision” are strikingly linked to the four cornerstones of masculinity identified by David and Brannon (1976) and other elements of corporate masculinity (Tables II and III). As hierarchical systems, NASA and MTI empowered superiors and denied voice to subordinates. Views which challenged managerial prerogatives or which violated NASA’s “can-do; operational shuttle” ideology were suppressed or submerged. In effect, the managers in this chain of events were “men,’ the engineers “women” (metaphorically speaking). NASA management’s invocation of “logic” to invalidate the “qualitative, gut feelings” and “hand-wringing emotion” of the Thiokol engineers, allowed NASA to insist that “no data showed conclusively that cold temperature increased the risk.” (Mulloy, 1991) Following the rule of reason, NASA managers felt insulated from blame for having made “a logical decision that had a disastrous result.” Those who were opposed to the launch essentially were branded as “sissies,” and pressured to change their stance (“Real men take risks. Real men are always ready to fly.”) In acting out adult equivalents of “King of the Mountain” and “Chicken,” NASA and Morton Thiokol were, by the time the telecon took place on the evening of January 27th, already at the edge of the precipice. The “Russian Roulette” which allowed top NASA officials to keep the shuttles flying (at an ever accelerating pace, no less) all but guaranteed the tragic outcome which resulted on January 28th, 1986. The willingness to take ever greater (institutional) risks, while denying one’s weaknesses and neglecting to even consider the consequences of being wrong (“Give ‘Em Hell”), the bind devotion to and projection of the image of an “operational shuttle” that never was (“The Sturdy Oak”) were fueled in part by these men’s fears that ferreting out and speaking the truth might have threatened their personal livelihood or the viability of their organizations (“The Big Wheel”). I find it impossible to reflect back to Challenger without experiencing deep regret and pain, feelings which are probably shared by many readers recalling the event, exacerbated by the knowledge that it was entirely preventable. My research into the disaster, as explored herein, has convinced me that we would not have experienced that loss or pain if the key decisionmakers and the organizations themselves had been guided by a different set of managerial principles and organizational priorities than the masculine ones which so indelibly shaped their actions. This analysis does not assume that men are inherently “bad,” but that the norms by which they are expected to pattern their lives – in organizations and out – can be dysfunctional to the point of disaster. Masculinity, as currently conceived, is both inherent to organizations as well as problematic. By making these implicit and unquestioned norms of organizational life (i.e., corporate masculinity) both visible and problematic, it is hoped that organizations and the people (i.e., men) who run them will consider and explore alternatives. Exposing this factor as one of the root causes, if not the ultimate source, of the Challenger disaster may inspire managers and organizations to re-examine their basic assumptions about what it means to “be a man” in this society. If men can question the presumed efficacy of living up to that masculine standard, they can be encouraged to identify, acknowledge, appreciate and express their (so-called) feminine competencies – in their professional as well as personal lives. The paradox is that, by so doing, they can actively reshape the definition of “masculinity,” for it is instructive to remember that the masculine practices at issue here (e.g., an emphasis on ranking, status and respect for authority and the concomitant exclusion of subordinates from decision-making, the reckless bravado, and the excessive involvement with work) are only considered “masculine” because they have traditionally been more typical of the patterns men engage in than women. Similarly, when “feminine” practices are suggested as complements or alternatives (e.g., empowerment vs. dominance; participation and linking vs. authority and ranking; connection vs. confrontation; intimacy vs. intimidation; egalitarianism and inclusion vs. stratification and exclusion; consensus vs. top-down decision making, as shown in Tables II and III), it is important to recognize that these are labeled “feminine” only because they are (currently) more common of women (see Gilligan, 1982; Eisler, 1987; Tannen, 1990; Smith and Smits, 1994).</span></em><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">In addition to taking this feminist constructivist approach to gender analysis, I also want to apply a discourse lens to the issue to uncover the role of gender in shaping ‘the dialogue between power and knowledge found in the social construction of climate change’ (Pettenger 2007:1) .Here I draw on a constructivist approach within the politics and international relations fields as way to challenge both the positivist assumptions found in dominant discourse and to identify the complex interconnections of material and ideational factors (cf. Pettenger [ed.] 2007). Climate change may be ‘real’ and have material manifestations, but it is also being shaped by social and cultural norms and discourses. Explaining the use of a discourse lens in environmental politics, Epstein (2008:8) writes that ‘a discourse is a cohesive ensemble of ideas, concepts and categorisations about a specific object that frame that object in a certain way, and therefore delimit the possibilities for acting in relation to it’ (see also Dryzek 2005). Taking a critical look at discourses allows us to understand how people ‘make sense of themselves, of their interests and their ways of behaving, and of the world around them’ (Epstein 2008:7). Environmental politics scholars have noted that in the affluent world (namely in the USA and UK) climate change has been shaped by the three recognisable and hegemonic discourses of ecological modernisation, environmental security and green consumerism (Schlosberg and Rinfret 2008). I would add neo-Malthusian population control discourse to this list, but space does not permit discussion here (see MacGregor 2009b). A feminist interrogation of how these dominant discourses frame and construct the politics of climate change are gendered seems to be an important addition to -- and perhaps as a corrective to -- the existing ‘gender impacts’ research. I provide a brief overview of each below. The rise of climate change to the top of the green agenda has brought about an apparent masculinisation of environmental politics. There are several reasons for this assessment. At the most obvious level, it is clear that men are the dominant decision makers and the prominent spokespeople on climate change. One could say they have simply retained a position of dominance throughout the development of environmental policy and politics (see Seager 1993), but this would unfairly paper over the times during the history of the modern environmental movement when the balance of influence seemed to have shifted. During the 80s and 90s, when the focus of the environmental movement was on the issues of health, antimilitarism, right livelihood, biodiversity and resistance to ‘maldevelopment’ (Mies and Shiva 1993), women were prominent activists. Key iconic figures included the women activists of Greenham Common (protesting cruise missiles in the UK), Clayoquout Sound (protesting the clear cutting of old growth forests on the west coast of Canada) and Chipko (saving trees to from the axe in India), along with individual environmental leaders such as Lois Gibbs, Petra Kelly, Vandana Shiva, Medha Patkar and Wangari Maathai. Since the late 90s or so, the shift of the dominant environmental focus to climate change has been accompanied by a relocating of the centre environmental debate and action to within (rather than outside) the scientific and policy-making institutions. This has brought a shift in the key protagonists and has brought men to the fore as policy experts, scientists, political advocates, entrepreneurs, commentators and celebrities. Men far outnumber women in scientific and decision-making organisations that have responsibility for addressing the ‘climate crisis’. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is mostly made up of male scientists (only 16 % are women). International environmental delegations are mostly made up of and lead by men (Dankelman 2002). For example of the 146 national delegations participating at the recent UN Climate Summit in New York in September 2009, seven were headed by women. The new UN climate financing group announced in March 2010 (co-chaired by Gordon Brown and Meles Zenawi) is made up of an equal number of representatives from Annex I and Annex II countries, yet all 19 members are men. The most prominent political and celebrity climate change spokespeople are male (think Stern, Gore, Pachauri Milliband, Monbiot, Porritt, etc.) (see Nielson Company 2007). In affluent minority world countries like the UK women are a small minority in fields that have influence over climate change policy making, ‘representing only 18% of MPs, 24% of MEPs and 19% of scientists and engineers’ (WEN &amp; NFWI 2007:11). So why is it that women are so absent from climate politics and policy making? One possible answer is that the climate change debate has been shaped by stereotypically masculinist discourses that work to ‘invisibilise’ and alienate women and their concerns. This exclusionary process can operate in scientific institutions, policy circles, in the media and in society at large. Two stereotypically masculinist discourses I have in mind are ecological modernisation and environmental security. Climate change is widely represented as a techno-scientific problem requiring technical solutions. Ecological modernisation (EM) discourse has become dominant in the past decade in the UK and Europe and is catching hold in the USA (Schlosberg and Rinfret 2008). Simply put, EM advocates the use of ‘technological advancement to bring about [both] better environmental performance’ and economic efficiency in a win-win situation (Schlosberg and Rinfret 2008: 256). Moving beyond the tired and overly politicised notion of ‘sustainable development’, EM has a supply side focus and depends on cooperation between (male dominated) government and (male dominated) business to solve environmental problems (cf. Hajer 1995). Climate change represents a welcome opportunity for this worldview; it provides a serious global problem to solve through the wise partnering of techno-innovators and brave capitalists. Thus the crisis has brought about the development of all sorts of technical fixes that are economically lucrative and thus apparently win-win, such as carbon trading and offsetting, carbon capture and storage, carbon sequestration, renewable energy (wind, solar, wave and geothermal power, biofuels), patented genetically modified crops, and the list could go on. Much of the responses to climate change come in the form of innovations and gadgets: ‘lots of neat green stuff’ (Schlosberg and Rinfret 2008:268). While many of these innovations will be necessary for a sustainable future, EM advocates more technology and more development; a continuation of ‘doing what we do’ with more omnipotence rather than humility about both the benefits and the costs of human ingenuity to date. The other (and related) dominant masculinist discourse that appears in the climate change debate is that of environmental security (ES). It is underpinned by Hobbesian predictions that climate change will inevitably lead to conflict over scarce resources between and within states (cf. Homer-Dixon 1998). Since the early 1990s, defence ministries (traditionally the domain of men) have been interpreting environmental ‘insecurities’ in ways that call for armed and militaristic readiness, alliances and responses (Elliott 2004). Some scholars have warned against this ‘securitizing’ move, arguing that it is contrary to the cooperation that is necessary on this shared planet and forgets the lessons of past wars and the environmental devastation caused by militarism. Some have said that environmentalism should stick with its core concerns for health, nature, and future generations rather than don the ‘blood soaked garments of war’ (Deudney 1990 in Schlosberg and Rinfret 2008:262). But such warnings have not been heeded, and there has been growing interest in recent years in presenting climate change as a serious threat to national and global security. In 2004 the UK’s Chief Scientist Sir David King made the connection clear, saying that climate change is a worse threat than terrorism (Connor 2004). Ironically, the environment was once considered a ‘soft politics’ issue in the field of international relations, far removed from the ‘hard’ political issues of security and military affairs (Peterson and Runyan 1999:59-60). Now environment has become ‘hardened’ by the threats to national and international order that climate change is predicted to bring its wake (e.g., climate refugees). By securitising and militarising it, the environmental crisis becomes a problem that requires technical, diplomatic and military solutions, entirely consistent with hegemonic (hyper)masculinity. Climate change is the dominant issue for environmental politics today and, as I have suggested, it has been framed by two masculinist discourses and taken up by the institutions that are dominated by elite men. The worrying results of this are that women are excluded from decision-making and leadership roles and that the kinds of environmental issues that women traditionally have felt most passionate about have been pushed off the agenda, even though they have not gone away. Could women have become alienated from the climate change debate because they are less inclined than men to engage with science and technology? It is widely known that hegemonic femininity does not encourage women’s aptitude for maths and science, and the underrepresentation of women in these fields provides convincing evidence. When it comes to a highly scientised and compartmentalised debate like climate change, it is quite possible that many women simply ‘switch off’. According to survey data collected in the UK ‘…men are better informed about climate change science than women (Hargreaves et al. 2003 quoted in Shackley, McLachlan and Gough 2004:33). Reflecting on her experience of high-level climate meetings,’ Ulrike Rohr, director of the German gender and environment project Genanet, attributes the low participation of women to the exclusively scientific and technical approach to global warming. “Women feel like they can’t enter the discussions,”‘she says (quoted in Stoparic 2006). Another important consequence of climate change becoming the dominant issue is that most other environmental issues – those about which women care most -- have been sidelined. Studies have found that women tend to be interested in the health and future prospects of children and about the environment- related issues that affect quality of life (cf. MacGregor 2006). For example, women have spearheaded campaigns on pesticide use, electromagnet fields, toxic contamination, hormones in cow’s milk, multiple chemical sensitivity, biodiversity and seed saving. Few of these now get much attention by climate change campaigners. As Bretherton (2003:108) observes ‘environmental organisations such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have witnessed the marginalisation of women, and of the issues most frequently raised by women around health, wildlife and local environment’. Where once women had some expertise and authority on environmental protection they have now been alienated from the dominant issues and solutions. In fact, climate change is now being used to ‘trump’ some of the issues about which women express concern. For example nuclear energy has been put back on the agenda. Fears of the health risks of radiation from nuclear power and nuclear waste (significantly higher among women than men; cf. Solomon, Tomaskovic-Devey and Risman, 1989; Kiljunen 2007; Freudenberg and Davidson 2007) have been put aside because it is allegedly a low-CO2 emitting form of energy production. The potential health risks and the ethical uncertainties associated with genetically-modified organisms (expressed more by women than men; see, for example, GM Nation Report 2003; Moon and Balasubramanian 2004) have been put to one side in the face of climate-related crop failures and the need for biofuels. Rather than look to technical fixes for environmental problems, women have tended to focus on the social dimension: sustainable lifestyles, ethical consumption and the precautionary principle (Johnsson-Latham 2007:6). WEDO embraces the concept of ‘human security’, as distinct from environmental security discourse and as more appropriate to women’s concerns. They define it as the protection of ‘the vital core of all human lives in ways that enhance human freedoms and fulfilment’ (Ogata and Sen 2003); the security of individuals, their livelihoods, and human rights including economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security and political security (Dankelman et al 2008:2). Although the academic literature on human security does not necessarily make this connection (for an exception see Goldworthy 2010), WEDO believes that it reflects a stereotypically feminine set of concerns – and that these are more ethically and socially relevant concerns than those that seem to capture the attention of people in power. This is the position taken by the contributors to the climate change issues of Gender and Development. Masika (2002:3) writes: ‘Predominant approaches and policy responses have focused on scientific and technological measures to tackle climate change problems. They have displayed scant regard for the social implications of climate change outcomes and the threats these pose for poor men and women, or for the ways in which people’s political and economic environments influence their ability to respond to the challenges of climate change.’ From this perspective, the twin discourses of ecological modernisation and environmental security represent more of the same gender politics and threaten to intensify the underlying causes of climate change. It is a paradox of the climate change debate that women are absent and alienated from it at the same time as being increasingly implicated in its solution. While the masculinist EM discourse focuses on supply side, technical soluti</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">militaristic ‘muscle-flexing’ (Denton 2002:18), there is a parallel feminising discourse of green consumerism that places the onus on individual consumers to take responsibility for reducing the environmentally harmful impacts of contemporary life. Governments and environmentalists place emphasis on the role of individuals as consumers to tackle climate change by conserving energy, taking public transit, recycling waste, growing food and foregoing flights. One example is the UK Government’s Act on CO2 campaign which gives helpful hints for reducing individuals’ ‘carbon footprint’ when ‘in the home’, ‘on the move’ and ‘out shopping’ (</span><span style="color: blue; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://campaigns.direct.gov.uk/actonco2/home/" rel="nofollow">http://campaigns.direct.gov.uk/actonco2/home/</a></span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">). The cheerful website offers helpful tips on being green when planning meals, doing laundry, putting out the rubbish, and buying clothes. Such policies and campaigns that focus on the duty of individual consumers are not new: environmentalism has been played out in the domestic sphere for decades. Climate change has helped to usher in a new agenda that adopts the same discourse with added urgency, not to mention added centralisation of the message in the hands of government.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The temporal aporias seem to abound in contemporary debates around ballistic missile defence. While we seemingly have displaced our collective memories in and around the ‘birth’ of missile defence, at the same time we have displaced contemporary renditions of missile defence back (in)to the future. The debates have this odd temporal dimension to them as though we are simply talking about something in the future, something that has yet to occur, whether in the near or distant future really does not matter. I say this because when we talk about whether we should or should not do something, what gets occluded, and indeed obfuscated is how in asking the questions, in naming the thing, in some ways, it already is. The ‘should we or should we not debate,’ never asks the question: how is ballistic missile defence and the desire for a protective shield already working? In saying this, I obviously do not mean in the technical or technological sense, but in the sense of how it is already working in our political imaginary, how it is already working to construct how we understand our reality, ourselves, and others in the world. Saying that ballistic missile defence is already working in our political imaginary, is suggesting that the operation of a ‘missile defence shield’ is not simply about the realisation of its material self, but significantly how it is already operating through the metaphors and images evoked in the naming (Orford 1999). Understanding the “metaphoric effect with the production of meaning itself, that is…the very life of language or thought in general”(Stellardi 2000:21). Metaphors and imagery are not merely inert devices which aid description and explanation, rather they are doing discursive work through their significations and circulations. Analysis of the metaphorical basis of security policy can thus serve to reveal the constructed nature of international security. It is a construction of the imagination. It therefore matters a great deal who is doing the imagining, and what the implications are of the resultant image…Ultimately, the analysis of metaphor is a route to the opening up of alternatives in international security, alternatives that are rooted in the commitments of those making the choice of metaphors (Mutimer 1997:216).</span><br />
