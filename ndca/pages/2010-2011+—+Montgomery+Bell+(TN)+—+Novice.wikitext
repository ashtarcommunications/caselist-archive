==**Plan: The United States federal government should implement a phased withdrawal of its ground troops in the Republic of Korea.**== 
== == 
==**Advantage 1 is Korean War**== 
**The sinking of the South Korea’s ship makes conflict inevitable – retaliation will spark an escalatory war and failure to respond will only cause more North Korean provocations.**
**Bandow, 10**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former special assistant to Reagan (4/18/10, Doug, “Let the Koreans Take Care of the Koreas,” [[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/doug-bandow/let-the-koreans-take-care_b_542141.html]], JMP)</span>

**The status quo is __fundamentally different__ than the past – the chance of a major miscalculation and global escalation is possible now in __five different ways__**
**Sanger, 10**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (5/28/10, David E. Sanger, NY Times, “In the Koreas, Five Possible Ways to War,”</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/weekinreview/30sanger.html]], JMP)</span>

**U.S. presence makes provocations inevitable and guarantees our draw in**
**Bandow, 10**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute and former Special Assistant to Reagan (5/3/10, Doug, “Taming Pyongyang,” [[http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=23336]], JMP)</span>

**The U.S. response to bolster deterrence will just increase provocations and make miscalculation more likely**
**Armstrong, 10 –** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Professor of history and director of the Center for Korean Research at Columbia University.. (Charles, 5/26/10, CNN, “The Korean War never ended” [[http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/05/24/armstrong.north.korea/index.html]])</span>

**North Korea might decide that it has nothing to lose in the status quo – making more miscalculations likely**
**Righter, 10**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Worked for the Far Eastern Economic Review and Newsweek in Asia, as development and diplomatic correspondent of The Sunday Times. (Rosemary, 5/25/10, Times Online, “It’s risky, but this time North Korea must pay” [[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/rosemary_righter/article7136464.ece]])</span>

**Also, North Korean aggression and nuclearization will cause intentional, miscalculated, or accidental nuclear conflict – even a limited nuclear war causes rapid cooling and ozone disruption, collapses the economy, and spills over to other hot spots**
**Hayes & Hamel-Green, 10**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – *Executive Director of the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainable Development, AND **Executive Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Education and Human Development act Victoria University (1/5/10, Executive Dean at Victoria, “The Path Not Taken, the Way Still Open: Denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/10001HayesHamalGreen.pdf]]</span>)**</span>

Withdrawing __ground troops__ solves – stops North Korea from probing U.S. weakness to draw our forces into a wider conflict. Air and naval installations will maintain power projection capabilities.
Stanton, 10**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – U.S. Army Judge Advocate in Korea from 98-02 and practicing attorney in Washington, D.C. (4/12/10, Joshua, The New Ledger, “It's Time for the U.S. Army to Leave Korea,” [[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/11/opinion/main6386737.shtml]], JMP)</span>**
[[#_Toc265749471]]
U.S. presence is useless to deter North Korea – withdrawal will motivate South Korea and China to stabilize and de-nuclearize the peninsula
Erickson, 10**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Executive Director of CenterMovement.org (5/6/10, Stephen, “End the Cold War in Korea: Bring American Troops Home Before it’s Too Late,” [[http://www.centermovement.org/topics-issues/end-the-cold-war-in-korea-bring-american-troops-home-before-its-too-late/]], JMP)</span>**
[[#_Toc265749472]]
A phased withdrawal prevents U.S. draw in – regional security efforts can effectively resolve Korea crises

==**Advantage Two is is Military Overstretch.**==

**Korea is the lynchpin of US overstretch – withdrawal provides needed resources**
**CUMMINGS 2004** (Colonel John Cummings, US Army War College, “Should the U.S. Continue to Maintain Forces in South Korea?” May 3, [[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA423298&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf|**http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA423298&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf**]]) 

**Overstretch cripples American military power**
