**Spokesman Review 12** March 23, 2012 EPA RULING STRIKES BLOW FOR PEOPLE'S DUE PROCESS, lexis
As the Supreme Court noted in a 2006 case, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers haveadopted a very broad interpretation of the word "navigable," extending their jurisdiction over virtually anything wet that flows into or is adjacent to a truly navigable waterway like Priest Lake. The rationale, which the court has accepted, is the protection wetlands provide by absorbing and cleaning runoff.

which is defined by Bouvier as meaning “to establish by law”.

**The USFG is the government in Washington D.C.**
**Encarta 2k** (http://encarta.msn.com)

“The federal government of the United States is centered in Washington DC”

**B. Violation: The aff doesn’t defend a policy action**

**C. Standards**
**1. Topic Specific Education**

**Policy discussions in the context of transportation infrastructure is uniquely key for high school students - this is important to overcome communication gaps and encourage future career opportunities**
**Regenold 5** (Michele – Center for Transportation Research and Education, Workforce Recruitment Dilemma: Defining Transportation and Transportation Careers, Mid-Continent Transportation Research Symposium, August, http://www.ctre.iastate.edu/pubs/midcon2005/RegenoldWorkforce.pdf, Accessed 7/10/12, p. 2)

When high school and college students hear the term “transportation,” what comes to mind? Moving goods and people?
AND
. Because of this communication gap, recruiting young people into professional and non-professional careers in transportation can be particularly challenging.

**2. Ground- there is no way to generate offense on the negative, they don’t take a position on the resolution which is the only predictable way for negative teams to research and prepare for equitable debate**
**Shively 00** (Ruth Lessi, Associate Professor of Political Science at Texas A&M, 2000, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p. 182-3)

The point may seem trite, as surely the ambiguists would agree that basic terms must be shared before they can be resisted and problematized.
AND
Such agreements are simply implicit in the act of argumentation.

**3. Plan focused knowledge is key to public participation which is the only way to affect structural issues**
**Wilson et al 3** (Richard, interim Dean at the College of Environmental Design at California State Polytechnic University, Marianne Payne, directs strategic planning at the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, and Ellen Smith, manages BART’s planning in Contra Costa County, Does Discussion Enhance Rationality? APA Journal, 69(4), Autumn 2003, pg. 355)

In the last decade, transportation agencies have addressed new and controversial issues such as travel behavior modification, pricing, and environmental justice.
AND
. Our argument is that the process of transportation planning must change substantially to respond to its changing context and to address contested policy choices.

**4. Judge evaluation – their framework provides no coherent criteria for how the judge should assess competing claims or weigh impacts. We give criteria by which one can make decisions, whereas their arguments amount to empty speculation at best.**
**Ignatieff 4** (Michael, Carr Professor of Human Rights Practice, Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the JFK School of Government, Harvard University, 2004, The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror, p. 20-1)

There are two problems with a perfectionist stance, leaving aside the question of whether it is realistic. AND
Drawing these lines means keeping in clear sight the question of whether these means reinforce or betray the democratic identity they are supposed to defend.

**5. You can negate the resolution when you’re negative: debating both sides of an issue is key to critical education and producing social change**
**English et al 7** (Eric, Stephen Llano, Assistant Professor; Director of Debate Department of Rhetoric, Communication and Theater, Gordon R.

Given the switch-side norm of academic debate and the highly controversial nature of the resolution, ‘‘
AND
This may explain why those invested in the stability of such polar categories find debate so threatening.

**7.State Focus Good- Failure to engage in the political process will result in the takeover by the extreme right, leading to discrimination and war worldwide.**
**Rorty 98** (prof of philosophy at Stanford, Richard, 1998, “achieving our country” pg. 89-94)JFS

Many writers on socioeconomic policy have warned that the old industrialized democracies are heading into a Weimar-like period, one in which populist movements are likely to overturn constitutional governments.

This is the name of what Edmund­son calls Foucault's "haunting agency, which is everywhere and nowhere, as evanescent and insistent as a resourceful spook."10

**Boggs, Professor of Political Science, ‘97**
(Carl, National University, Theory & Society 26, December, p. 773-4)

The decline of the public sphere in late twentieth-century America poses a series of great dilemmas and challenges.
AND
. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collective interests that had vanished from civil society.75

**<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Framework is a precondition for debate</span>**
**Shively 00** (Ruth Lessi, Associate Professor of Political Science at Texas A&M, 2000, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p. 182-3)

The requirements given thus far are primarily negative.
AND
In short, the contesting of an idea presumes some agreement about what that idea is and how one might go about intelligibly contesting it. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.
