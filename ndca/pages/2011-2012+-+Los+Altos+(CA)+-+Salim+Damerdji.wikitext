===Contractarianism AC:=== 
I affirm. Interpetations:

1. Aff advocacy. I specify victims that do deliberately kill their batterers. Creates realistic ground for the aff. Also gives the aff key self-d ground. Coughlin. <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 4pt;">Anne M. Coughlin (Assistant Professor of Law, Vanderbilt Law School. B.A. 1978, Tufts University; M.A. 1979, Columbia University; J.D. 1984, New York University), “Excusing Women,” California Law Review, January, 1994 (82 Calif. L. Rev. 1) "Rather they asserted that...use deadly force"</span>

2. Hanser defines moral permissibility. <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 4pt;">Hanser, Matthew. “Permissibility and Practical Inference”. //Ethics//. Vol. 115, No. 3 (April 2005), pp. 443-470. University of Chicago Press.</span>"An agent who has... about moral considerations"

3. Cx checks. I'll concede the violation or kick the interp depending on what you want. Just pwease dont run theowy.

4. Reasonability and RVI's are good. They're also compatible since reasonability protects sub-par aff interps, not bad neg ones

V=morality.

Morality is based on normative reasons. Wallace1<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 6pt;">R. Jay Wallace. "Internalism about Responsibility" http://philosophy.berkeley.edu/file/652/Internalism_about_Responsibility.pdf</span>"But there is a deeper... the actions to which they apply"

Finlay clarifies internal vs. external reasons. <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 6pt;">Stephen Finlay, Mark Schroeder. “Reasons for Action: Internal vs. External” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Sept. 4, 2008. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-internal-external// </span>"It is some sign... externalism about reasons"

Only internal reasons are true. Three warrants:

1. External reasons don't justify action. So their purported conclusion that "you must do x" is flawed. Hence, they're illogical

2. Can't weigh external reasons. Broome. <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 6pt;">Broome, John. “Reasons” for </span>__<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 6pt;">Reasons and Value: Essays on the Moral Philosophy of Joseph Raz</span>__<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 6pt;">, edited by R. Jay Wallace, Michael Smith, Samuel Scheffler, and Philip Pettit. Oxford University Press. 2003 </span>"an explanation strictly analogous... total of their weights"

3. External reasons can't deny our internal reasons. Prichard. from his article "does all of ethics rest on a mistake?" "Now it is easy to show...this latter is impossible"

Wallace2. This means motivation is a requisite to ethics.

Gauthier1 [this is the card everyone has]

plus other theories are circular.

So standard is contractarianism

<span style="font-family: Helvetica;">I contend Contractarianism can’t prohibit the use of deadly force in the specified circumstances.</span>

A. People won't forego interest if their life is on the line

B. Ewing/ no alternatives means this is their only interest.<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 4pt;">Psychological Self-Defense: A Proposed Justification for Battered Women Who Kill Author(s): Charles Patrick Ewing Reviewed work(s): Source: Law and Human Behavior, Vol. 14, No. 6 (Dec., 1990), pp. 579-594 Published by: Springer Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/1394137 .

C. No enforcement. Police failed in the past. No reason to trust batterer

D. Ewing2/Domestic violence continues due to lies of batterer. "In addition to describing... violence escalates"

===Utilitarianism AC===
