The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its military presence by withdrawing the Futenma Base from the island of Okinawa. We reserve the right to clarify.


[[#_Toc283446200]]
Futenma lives-even if Gates made concessions, the base will not be removed because the US still insists on the same site and Okinawan government is against and can veto new base.
Snider 1-14(Daniel, aniel Sneider is associate director of the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University and a former foreign correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor, “Getting real on Japan.” [[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/14/getting_real_on_japan?page=0,0]])
Two learning curves intersected in Tokyo this week when U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates came to town, part of a Northeast Asian swing that started in Beijing and will finish in Seoul.One curve is under way in Japan, where the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) is learning the difference between campaigning and governing. Ending a half-century of nearly uninterrupted conservative rule, the DPJ came to power in September 2009 vowing to forge a more "equal" relationship with its patron ally and put more emphasis on Japan's ties with Asian neighbors, particularly China and South Korea.The DPJ also pledged to reduce the burden of hosting U.S. bases placed on the people of Okinawa, where the bases occupy nearly a fifth of the island. The new government hoped to revisit the unimplemented 1996 agreement to move the helicopters and planes stationed at Futenma Marine air base, dangerously crowded in among apartment buildings and schools on the southern part of the island, to a new base built in its less densely populated northern half.Since taking power, the DPJ has struggled to reconcile its electoral pledges with the reality of a serially provocative North Korea and an increasingly aggressive China. Yukio Hatoyama's inability to manage the base issue with the United States became emblematic of his weak leadership, costing him the premiership after only nine months and contributing to the party's loss of the upper house of parliament last summer.Americans somewhat smugly congratulate Tokyo for its belated realism. Less acknowledged is Washington's own learning curve about both the realities of politics in Japan and the enduring value of the alliance. The early days of the DPJ administration were marked by barely disguised U.S. disdain for its political ineptitude and domestic troubles, and even, among some U.S. officials, expectations that a strategic condominium with China could eventually supplant the Cold War alliance with Japan.Gates's successful role as alliance manager this week stands in stark contrast to his visit more than a year ago, in October 2009. Back then, he came to bluntly tell the Japanese to drop any talk of reopening the Okinawa base issue. "This may not be the perfect alternative for anyone," Gates said, "but it is the best alternative for everyone, and it is time to move on." He dismissed any other options as "politically untenable and operationally unworkable."As for the alliance, Gates forcefully reminded his Japanese hosts that Americans were there to protect their country -- allowing the Japanese to spend very little on their own self-defense over the past half-century. At the same time, Obama administration officials talked openly about Japan's diminishing importance, hinting at China's potential as a new strategic partner. A senior State Department official told the Washington Post that the U.S. had "grown comfortable" with the idea of Japan as a constant in U.S. relations with the region. It no longer fills that role, he said, adding ominously that "the hardest thing right now is not China -- it's Japan."The March 2010 sinking of a South Korean corvette, the Cheonan, shook that illusory view of the region. China's decision to back Pyongyang and its vocal opposition to U.S. naval deployments in the Yellow Sea surprised some in Washington. Meanwhile the DPJ government in Tokyo lined up strongly behind Seoul, as it did later after North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island last November. The new administration of Prime Minister Naoto Kan, Hatoyama's successor, got its own shock when Beijing purposely escalated tensions over the arrest of a Chinese fishing-boat captain following a collision near Japanese-controlled islands in the disputed oil and gas rich waters of the East China Sea.By last fall, talk of a "strategic partnership" with China had been replaced by a new emphasis on bolstering traditional Cold War-era cooperation among Japan, South Korea, and the United States. In October, ahead of the president's visit to Japan, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell admitted that the "learning process is not confined just to Tokyo."Campbell told reporters in Tokyo that the difficulties of the past year served as "a reminder to the United States [of] how badly we need a good relationship with Japan" to deal with the challenges in Asia. "It is critical for this generation of American policymakers to in no way take Japan for granted," he said, in an obvious swipe at more Sino-centric colleagues back in Washington. Those two learning curves visibly crossed during Gates's visit to Tokyo this week. The Kan administration, fresh off talks in Seoul about strengthening security ties, showed much greater readiness to cooperate on regional security. It is ready to ease restrictions on export to third countries of missile-defense technology jointly developed by the two countries, a move the United States has sought. Gates offered his own upbeat vision of a renewed Japan-U.S. alliance in the 21st century: "While issues associated with Okinawa and Futenma have tended to dominate the headlines this past year," Gates [[@http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4753|told the press]], "the U.S.-Japan defense alliance is broader, deeper, and indeed richer than any single issue. In this, the 51st year of the U.S.-Japan alliance, it is important to remember that ours is an enduring and equal partnership based on interests and values that unite our two peoples." As for the base issue, Gates was notably deferential to his hosts. "We do understand that it is politically a complex matter in Japan and we intend to follow the lead of the Japanese government in working with the people of Okinawa to take their interests and their concerns into account." This represents a real change of tone, if not policy, provided it is sustained. Having reached this point of intersection, Tokyo and Washington are no closer, however, to solving the problem that has bedeviled their relationship. Reading Gates's words carefully, he still insists on the base being moved to the proposed Henoko location, though perhaps at a slower tempo. Both governments are once again resorting to traditional tactics of trying to buy off islanders with economic subsidies, promises of construction contracts, and gestures such as moving noisy aircraft exercises elsewhere. Standing on the white-sand shores of the pristine bay, as I have, and looking out onto glistening blue waters into which the United States proposes to dump a mountain of sand and build the new air base, it is easy to understand why this has no more chance of working now than it did during decades of conservative rule. And the victory of anti-base candidates in elections in the last year on Okinawa, both in the locality around the proposed base and for the governorship, made this clear. The strategic importance of the U.S. presence in Japan, particularly of the 7th Fleet based on the main island of Honshu and the sprawling Kadena Air Base on Okinawa, is not in question. And given recent events, the availability of some Marine forces makes sense. But neither government has made a convincing case for why an entire Marine expeditionary force needs to remain on Okinawa. Ultimately, both governments are still going to have to find a real alternative to the base problem, while keeping their eyes focused firmly on the strategic horizon. The question is whether both Washington and Tokyo can take what they have learned so far and move forward to a more mature and yes, more equal, relationship.


Withdrawal key- upcoming issues that will strain the alliance because of the DPJ’s stance.
Klinger 10 (Bruce, senior reaserch fellow on east asia at the heritage institute and masters in national sevurity from National War College. “With-re-acceptance of marines on Okinawa, time to look ahead. 5-10. [[http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2010/05/With-Re-Acceptance-of-Marines-on-Okinawa-Time-to-Look-Ahead]])
These concerns in turn triggered broader U.S. unease over the DPJ’s long-term security plans and Japan’s reliability as an ally. As one U.S. official commented, the DPJ is raising issues that question virtually every aspect of the fundamentals of the alliance. Both sides should seek to minimize the fallout from the Futenma dispute by minimizing differences on forthcoming contentious bilateral security issues, such as the pending renegotiation of the Status of Forces Agreement and Japan’s burden sharing commitment. Washington and Tokyo should also look for opportunities to highlight shared objectives and common policies. The Hatoyama administration’s announcement that it would strongly support the U.S. and South Korean resolute response to North Korea’s naval attack was a step in the right direction. Mending the U.S.–Japan alliance will not be easy. The DPJ’s coalition partners, as well as factions within the DPJ itself, will feel betrayed by Hatoyama’s Futenma decision. The DPJ has not yet articulated its security and foreign policies, nor has it defined its vision for Japan’s global security role. Despite clamoring for an “equal alliance” with the U.S., the DPJ has failed to define its terms or display a willingness to assume greater responsibilities commensurate with such a role. The U.S.–Japan alliance remains critical to maintaining peace and stability in Asia as well as guaranteeing shared values of freedom and democracy. It is essential that the two administrations step up public diplomacy efforts to better explain the benefits of the alliance as well as the necessity of forward-deployed U.S. military forces.
DPJ rule and cost-cutting measures for Japan make further confilct inevitable-concessions key from U.S.
Feffer 10(John, he co-director of Foreign Policy in Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies and writes its regular World Beat column, “Okinawa and the new domino effect.” 3-6. [[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/LC06Dh02.html]])
It also amended the 1954 Self-Defense Forces Law, which defines what the Japanese military can and cannot do, more than 50 times to give its forces the capacity to act with striking offensive strength. Despite its "peace constitution", Japan now has one of the top militaries in the world. Enter the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). In August 2009, that upstart political party dethroned the LDP, after more than a half-century in power, and swept into office with a broad mandate to shake things up. Given the country's nose-diving economy, the party's focus has been on domestic issues and cost-cutting. Not surprisingly, however, the quest to cut pork from the Japanese budget has led the party to scrutinize the alliance with the US. Unlike most other countries that host US military bases, Japan shoulders most of the cost of maintaining them:


Futenma is the key issue in the alliance.
Daily Yomiuri 1/6 (1/6/11, " Beefing up Japan-US alliance key to security ", [[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/editorial/T110106002122.htm]])
Beefing up Japan-U.S. alliance key to security The Japan-U.S. alliance is now confronted with two major challenges. One is the task of rebuilding the bilateral ties that deteriorated after the autumn 2009 launch of the government of former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama. The other is the question of how to cope with the alarmingly worsening security situation in East Asia, including security concerns over China and North Korea. These are tasks of the highest significance to Japan's diplomacy, the outcome of which could determine the fate of the Kan administration. The government must buckle down to resolving the problems with its utmost efforts. Solid, amicable relations between Tokyo and Washington must be rebuilt. Two keys to this project will be Prime Minister Kan's scheduled trip to the United States this spring and adoption of a joint statement regarding a deepening of the alliance between the two countries. The joint statement was earlier planned to be made last year, the 50th anniversary of the revision of the Japan-U.S. security treaty. But before that could happen, the issue of relocating functions of the U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station, Okinawa Prefecture, was driven into a logjam by Hatoyama's irresponsible call for a "Japan-U.S. alliance on an equal footing." With that, the task of deepening the alliance stalled. Of crucial importance, of course, is not merely the announcement of the envisioned joint statement but its substance. The 1996 Japan-U.S. joint security declaration reconfirmed that the alliance between the two nations should be regarded as the foundation of the stability and prosperity of Asia even after the end of the Cold War. The declaration also stated that the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation would be put under review. The planned joint statement should clarify the goals of 21st-century Japan-U.S. defense cooperation in a way that will facilitate steady and specific negotiations of the details. At the same time, tangible progress on resolving the Futenma problem is an absolute must. Okinawa Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima won a second four-year term in the November 2010 election on the strength of his campaign pledge to "have the Futenma Air Station moved out of our prefecture." Thus, it will be extremely difficult for Kan's administration to get the governor to change his mind in favor of having Futenma relocated within Okinawa Prefecture. The difficulty, however, cannot be used to justify procrastination by the Kan Cabinet. The administration instead should redouble its efforts to persuade Nakaima and other key parties concerned to accept the idea of relocating Futenma within the prefecture. By relocating the Futenma facility and transferring 8,000 marines from Okinawa Prefecture to Guam, the burden on residents in the prefecture in hosting U.S. military installations would be reduced. This would be of epochal significance. Extensive areas of land will be reverted as a result of these moves. The central government should have serious, in-depth talks with local authorities on how to best use such land to create a new future for Okinawa Prefecture. The agenda for reorganizing U.S. forces in Japan include a number of other important items, such as the envisioned transfer of carrier-borne aircraft from the U.S. Atsugi Naval Air Facility, Kanagawa Prefecture, to the U.S. Marine Corps' Iwakuni Air Station, Yamaguchi Prefecture. Accomplishing these tasks at a steady pace will reinforce the continuity and reliability of the Japan-U.S. alliance. A string of incidents took place last year that raised security concerns for Japan. Among them were an attack by North Korea on a South Korean warship, the shelling by the North of Yeonpyeong Island near a disputed sea border between the two Koreas, the incident of a Chinese trawler slamming into two Japan Coast Guard vessels and Chinese naval helicopters buzzing Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels. Outbreaks of similar incidents in 2011 should be no surprise to us. Under the circumstances, the Japan-U.S. alliance is of heightened importance as a basis on which Japan should carry out diplomacy toward North Korea and China, as well as a cornerstone of the nation's military deterrence. To deal with nuclear and missile menaces from North Korea and to formulate rules for ensuring security in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, where conflicts between China and neighboring countries have become frequent, it is imperative to strengthen multilateral collaboration among such countries as South Korea, Australia and India together with Japan and the United States. Especially important to this country is its relationship with South Korea. Of bilateral ties between Tokyo and Washington, between Tokyo and Seoul and between Washington and Seoul, the link between Tokyo and Seoul is the weakest. Fortunately, since the inauguration of the administration of South Korean President Lee Myung Bak, Japan-South Korea relations have substantially improved. We would like to propose that Japan and South Korea release a joint statement on bilateral political affairs and security on the occasion of President Lee's official visit to this country. Dialogue between the two countries should also be encouraged on such matters as working out evacuation plans for Japanese nationals in South Korea and Japan-South Korea cooperation in the event of a contingency on the Korean Peninsula. Meanwhile, as China has now become a big economic and military power, prodding it to be a responsible actor in the international community is a key task common to Japan and the United States. Major global problems, including security in East Asia and global environmental and energy issues, can hardly be solved without China's involvement. Japan and the United States should jointly work out medium- and long-term strategies toward China with this question in mind. Along with diplomatic efforts, it also is indispensable for the government to beef up the country's defense arrangements. The new National Defense Program Guidelines the government decided on in December introduced a new national security concept, "dynamic defense capabilities."


Now is key- Futenma is preventing progress on US Japan relations which is encouraging Chinese, Russian, and North Korean Aggression.
Daily Yomiuri 1/8 (1/8/11,editorial by Ogawa, the Washington dc correspondent, " Maehara tasked with rebuilding US ties / First overseas trip of 2011 to ... ", [[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110108003080.htm]])
Maehara tasked with rebuilding U.S. ties / First overseas trip of 2011 to Washington; focus on security, Futenma relocation WASHINGTON--Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara was tasked during his visit to the United States with rebuilding Japan-U.S. relations that have been strained over the planned relocation of a U.S. military air base in Okinawa Prefecture. Maehara chose the United States as his first overseas destination this year. "It's been four months since I became foreign minister, but this is my fourth meeting with Secretary of State [Hillary] Clinton. I've found it meaningful to have detailed discussions on various issues of security, which comprise the core of the Japan-U.S. alliance," Maehara said at a joint press conference with Clinton after their meeting in Washington. Maehara left Tokyo on Thursday with the unavoidable mandate of repairing Japan-U.S. ties. His task was to move the issue of relocating the U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station from its place at the center of Japan-U.S. bilateral talks, a source close to Maehara said. Since the Democratic Party of Japan took power, the Japan-U.S. relationship has been particularly marred by the Futenma issue. The impasse was caused by former DPJ Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's attempt to scuttle the original agreement reached between the two countries in 2006 to relocate the base within the prefecture. As last year marked the 50th anniversary of the revision of the bilateral security treaty, some people expected Maehara and Clinton to discuss specific ways to deepen the Japan-U.S. alliance. However, a source familiar with Japan-U.S. diplomacy said: "The U.S. side has developed distrust toward Japan over the Futenma issue and said they're in a far-from-celebratory mood. The bilateral talks were downbeat." Solving the Futenma issue as early as possible is vital to firm bilateral ties, but it has been difficult for the government of Prime Minister Naoto Kan to win understanding from local people on relocating the base within the prefecture. Given the situation, Japan and the United States only sought ways of continuing bilateral talks as the next step toward breaking the impasse. During Thursday's ministerial meeting, Japan and the United States also agreed to set new joint strategic goals to alleviate tensions on the Korean Peninsula and in the East China Sea. Under the agreement, the two countries will draw up measures to strengthen bilateral cooperation for contingencies in neighboring areas that could pose a threat to Japan's peace and security, and then hold within a few months a so-called two-plus-two meeting of the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee comprising their foreign and defense ministers. Reaching an agreement to hold this two-plus-two meeting has significant implications. In May, Japan and the United States agreed to use the committee to address technical matters surrounding the Futenma relocation. Holding the committee meeting before the two countries see progress in negotiations on the relocation means they have given up on an early solution to the Futenma issue. "If the Futenma issue is separated from the agenda for Japan-U.S. bilateral negotiations, they can begin talks to deepen the alliance," a senior Foreign Ministry official said. Late last year, China and Russia took a firm stance against Japan, apparently taking advantage of the worsened Japan-U.S. relationship. Japan now faces "three diplomatic battle fronts: China, North Korea and Russia," one Foreign Ministry source said. To stabilize relations with these three countries, Maehara apparently believes Japan first should try to cement ties with the United States and regional neighbor South Korea. He apparently was treated well in the United States and appeared to have completed his first task this year. However, many challenges remain in terms of strengthening Japan-U.S. security cooperation, the main focus of talks to deepen bilateral ties. When drawing up new guidelines for Japan-U.S. security cooperation in 1997, the Japanese and U.S. governments started making plans for the Self-Defense Forces and the U.S. military to deal with an emergency on the Korean Peninsula or other contingencies. But specific work, such as selecting and making available Japanese ports and airports for U.S. military use in times of emergency, has yet to be implemented out of concern that local people would oppose any such moves. Japan also is likely to be urged by the United States to make international contributions when setting joint strategic goals in both Asia and elsewhere.

Cooperation caused by relations key to stop China and North Korean War
Nye 10(Joseph, professor of government at Harvard and assistant to the secretary of defense from 1991-1995. “An alliance larger than one issue” 1-6. [[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/opinion/07nye.html?_r=1&ref=opinion]])
Futenma, it is worth noting, is not the only matter that the new government has raised. It also speaks of wanting a more equal alliance and better relations with China, and of creating an East Asian community — though it is far from clear what any of this means. When I helped to develop the Pentagon’s East Asian Strategy Report in 1995, we started with the reality that there were three major powers in the region — the United States, Japan and China — and that maintaining our alliance with Japan would shape the environment into which China was emerging. We wanted to integrate China into the international system by, say, inviting it to join the World Trade Organization, but we needed to hedge against the danger that a future and stronger China might turn aggressive. After a year and a half of extensive negotiations, the United States and Japan agreed that our alliance, rather than representing a cold war relic, was the basis for stability and prosperity in the region. President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto affirmed that in their 1996 Tokyo declaration. This strategy of “integrate, but hedge” continued to guide American foreign policy through the years of the Bush administration. This year is the 50th anniversary of the United States-Japan security treaty. The two countries will miss a major opportunity if they let the base controversy lead to bitter feelings or the further reduction of American forces in Japan. The best guarantee of security in a region where China remains a long-term challenge and a nuclear North Korea poses a clear threat remains the presence of American troops, which Japan helps to maintain with generous host nation support. Sometimes Japanese officials quietly welcome “gaiatsu,” or foreign pressure, to help resolve their own bureaucratic deadlocks. But that is not the case here: if the United States undercuts the new Japanese government and creates resentment among the Japanese public, then a victory on Futenma could prove Pyrrhic.


And now is key-perception of a weak U.S. Japan alliance has been the cause of recent Chinese aggression-tensions are rising.
Kyodo News International 9/20 (9/20/10, " FOCUS: China's rise, Kan's inexperience behind Beijing's action on islets ", [[http://newsystocks.com/news/3699665]])
BEIJING, Sep. 20, 2010 (Kyodo News International) -- China's growing economic clout, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan's diplomatic inexperience, and strained Japan-U.S. ties are behind Beijing's heightened retaliation against Tokyo's handling of a ship collision off the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, according to some foreign policy observers. China has ''more cards in hand than the Japanese as their economy is largely dependent on China,'' Zhou Yongsheng, a professor of Japanese studies at China Foreign Affairs University, was quoted as saying in the Monday issue of the China Daily. ''China should take strong countermeasures.'' China has suspended exchanges ''at and above'' ministerial levels and other bilateral activity after a Japanese court Sunday authorized an extension of a 10-day detention of the Chinese ship captain until Sept. 29 for further investigations into the Sept. 7 incident. Gao Hong, deputy director at the Institute of Japanese Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, was quoted by the paper as saying last week that the ''inexperienced government of the Democratic Party of Japan will gradually learn that it is important to maintain a stable and healthy relationship with China.'' Gao expressed optimism that Japan would eventually back down. But Japan's new Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said Sunday that Japan will handle the case solemnly in accordance with domestic law, a sign that the political compromise Beijing seeks from Tokyo is unlikely. Some foreign policy experts argue that China is playing hardball against Japan amid deteriorating Japan-U.S. ties sparked by a dispute over the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station in Okinawa Prefecture, which forced Kan's predecessor Yukio Hatoyama to step down in June. Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage said last week that he believes China is taking advantage of a ''chill'' in Japan-U.S. relations, and that Beijing is ''testing what they can get away with.'' Armitage told reporters in Tokyo that the ship collision incident and the Chinese reaction served as a ''warning'' to other Asian countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei about a territorial dispute with Beijing in the South China Sea, particularly over the resource-rich Spratly Islands. Japan has urged China to be ''cool-headed'' in relation to Tokyo's detention of Chinese ship skipper Zhan Qixiong, which Beijing calls ''illegal.'' Demanding that Japan release Zhan ''immediately and unconditionally,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said Sunday, ''If Japan clings obstinately to its own course and insists on making one mistake after another, China will take strong countermeasures and Japan shall bear all the consequences.'' Ma did not say what tough countermeasures would involve. But observers suspect China may unilaterally start drilling at a disputed gas field in the East China Sea in which the two governments have agreed to let Japanese companies invest. China's hard-line stance suggests that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao will not meet bilaterally with Kan when they attend U.N. meetings this week in New York. Similarly, Kan is unlikely to visit China, which Chinese leaders requested earlier, at least in the near future. It has become uncertain whether Japanese and Chinese leaders will hold talks on the sidelines of international conferences later this year such as the Group of 20 summit in Seoul and the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Yokohama, both slated for November. The fresh retaliatory measures came after Beijing unilaterally suspended scheduled talks on joint gas field development in the East China Sea and postponed a planned visit to Japan by a delegation of the National People's Congress. Zhou of China Foreign Affairs University criticized Kan's DPJ for failing to have an ''effectual strategy'' to support the development of bilateral relations. Zhan was arrested and sent to prosecutors on suspicion of deliberately causing his vessel to collide with a Japanese patrol boat pursuing it near the Senkaku Islands. He is also suspected of illegally fishing in Japanese territorial waters. Japan has freed the 14 crew members and the Chinese trawler. China claims that the islands, administered by Japan but claimed by Beijing and Taiwan, have been Chinese territory since ancient times. The islands are known in China as Diaoyu and in Taiwan as Tiaoyutai.


China’s expansion causes a war over Taiwan which escalates to nuclear war
Straits Times, 00 [“Regional Fallout: No one gains in war over Taiwan,” Jun 25,]
THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -- horror of horrors -- raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its "non first use" principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.
Russian adventurism causes nuclear conflict, accidental launch and collapses Russian democracy
Cohen 96 (Ariel – senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, [[http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/1996/01/BG1065nbsp-The-New-Great-Game]], AD: 7/5/10)
The U.S. Role in the Great GameMuch is at stake in Eurasia for the U.S. and its allies. Attempts to restore its empire will doom Russia's transition to a democracy and free-market economy. The ongoing war in Chechnya alone has cost Russia $6 billion to date (equal to Russia's IMF and World Bank loans for 1995). Moreover, it has extracted a tremendous price from Russian society. The wars which would be required to restore the Russian empire would prove much more costly not just for Russia and the region, but for peace, world stability, and security.As the former Soviet arsenals are spread throughout the NIS, these conflicts may escalate to include the use of weapons of mass destruction. Scenarios including unauthorized missile launches are especially threatening. Moreover, if successful, a reconstituted Russian empire would become a major destabilizing influence both in Eurasia and throughout the world. It would endanger not only Russia's neighbors, but also the U.S. and its allies in Europe and the Middle East. And, of course, a neo-imperialist Russia could imperil the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf.15 Domination of the Caucasus would bring Russia closer to the Balkans, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Middle East. Russian imperialists, such as radical nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, have resurrected the old dream of obtaining a warm port on the Indian Ocean. If Russia succeeds in establishing its domination in the south, the threat to Ukraine, Turkey, Iran, and Afganistan will increase. The independence of pro-Western Georgia and Azerbaijan already has been undermined by pressures from the Russian armed forces and covert actions by the intelligence and security services, in addition to which Russian hegemony would make Western political and economic efforts to stave off Islamic militancy more difficult.
DPRK conflict escalates into maximum destruction
Chol ‘99, Executive Director of Center for Korean-American Peace, Kim Myong, “US-DPRK Will End Up in Shotgun Marriage,” Policy Forum Online, October 22, [[http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/9907G_Kim.html]].
Kim Jong Il, often called North Korea's David, did not flinch from standing up to the military muscle of the world's super-Goliath, the United States. Kim Jong Il had already built up a lethal war machine capable of wreaking unprecedented havoc on the American mainland at a minute's notice. Kim Jong Il is sure of the huge capability of his military. It would take the Korean People's Army as few as several minutes to wipe out off the world map the whole of South Korea and the entire Japanese archipelago. Significantly absent from the Perry report is a mention of the real threat of any new war in Korea instantly expanding into nuclear war, with 12 operating nuclear reactors in the ROK, 51 reactors in Japan and 102 in the United States singled out as prime targets. However, the Perry report noted that a new war would be fought on the world's most densely populated and industrialized areas, unlike the Gulf War and the Yugoslavia war. Resumption of hostilities in Korea would spell an abrupt end to the present unprecedented economic prosperity the Americans are enjoying. It would leave South Korea and Japan smoking in Stone-Age ruins. Forward military bases, AEGIS ships, nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, submarines and cruise missiles would be of little operational value in safeguarding the American mainland from nuclear holocaust. Moreover, dozens, hundreds of Chernobyls will inevitably break out in South Korea, Japan and the United States.
New U.S. Japan Alliance solves all impacts
Glosserman et al, ‘8. (Brad, Executive Director, Pacific Forum CSIS, expertise include: Nonproliferation and export controls, U.S.-Japan relations, East Asian security and foreign policy, Asia, Katsu, Senior Research Associate, Monterey Institute for International Studies, spoke on Japan, A New U.S.-Japan Agenda Vol. 8-No.4, March 2008, [[http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/issuesinsights_v08n04.pdf]], accessed: 6/26/08,)
The U.S.-Japan relationship remains central to regional and global security. Today, the key challenge for alliance managers is using their assets in new and creative ways. With a new approach, our nations can rejuvenate, sustain, and solidify the bilateral relationship, enhance regional and global security, and better the lives of millions or people around the world.
The two countries must deal with traditional security concerns, but military issues shouldn’t be the single core of the relationship. There are new issues that are better suited to the capabilities of two of the world’s richest and most technologically advanced countries. Cooperative policy approaches in several areas will enhance the strength of the U.S.-Japan bilateral relationship while promoting a positive image to other states. Areas of opportunity include: expanding and increasing global prosperity through reforms that increase efficiency and open economies, as well as promote good governance and rule of law; coordinating development assistance, and creating more effective aid programs; increasing trade and transportation security; preventing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; promoting energy security and policies that protect the environment; cooperation for crisis management, disaster relief and mitigation, and humanitarian aid in response to major disasters; cyber security; counter-terrorism cooperation; developing a framework for the safe integration of science and technology, including controls on dual use technology and “soft know-how; global health, including building capacity in developing countries to fight infectious diseases and to improve the public health infrastructure; and nation building and peace building.

Japanese Prime Minister Kan wants to pass TPP, but he is being blocked by farm lobbies.
Japan Times 1/14 (Kazuaki Nagata, 1/14/11, " New team seen prioritizing TPP entry, sales tax hike ", [[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20110115a1.html]])
Saturday, Jan. 15, 2011 Pastures new: Newly appointed economic and fiscal policy minister Kaoru Yosano speaks to reporters Friday in front of his home in Minato Ward, Tokyo. KYODO PHOTO ANALYSIS New team seen prioritizing TPP entry, sales tax hike Fiscal reconstruction drive may put bureaucrats back in driver's seat While Prime Minister Naoto Kan's Cabinet reshuffle was not radical, it sent out clear messages on some of the major economic and fiscal issues the new administration faces, including the promotion of a trans-Pacific free-trade pact and a hike in the consumption tax, economists said Friday. "In terms of fiscal reconstruction, the appointments show the new Cabinet is more focused on the issue," said Hideki Matsumura, senior economist at The Japan Research Institute. More specifically, the new Cabinet will seek to push for a hike in the sales tax, Matsumura said. Such a view is backed up by Kan's selection of two former finance ministers known as advocates of fiscal reconstruction — Kaoru Yosano, who has been appointed economic and fiscal policy minister, and Hirohisa Fujii, who was tapped for deputy chief Cabinet secretary. Drastic tax reform is a pressing issue for the Democratic Party of Japan-led government, which has experienced difficulties drafting budgets amid tough fiscal restraints. The fiscal situation is likely to remain dire in the near term, and the issuance of new bonds to finance the fiscal 2011 budget will top state revenue for the second straight year, providing the budget drafted last month by the government and related bills successfully clear the Diet. "I think this situation is unusual, and fiscal management under these circumstances is really difficult. We must extract ourselves from this situation as soon as possible and take fiscal reconstruction steps," said Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda at the time the fiscal 2011 budget was disclosed. Noda retained his portfolio in the reshuffled Cabinet. Government debt is projected to grow to ¥891 trillion by the end of March, representing about 184 percent of gross domestic product. Mitsuru Saito, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co., said Yosano will probably be tasked with the overall fiscal reconstruction project, while Fujii, a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat, is likely to work closely with the ministry to expedite policy goals. But by relying to such an extent on the Finance Ministry, Kan appears to be concentrating considerable power in the hands of its bureaucrats, recalling Liberal Democratic Party-led administrations that were criticized for allowing mandarins to drive government policies, Saito pointed out. Another key task for the new Cabinet is thought to be promotion of the U.S.-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, a regional free-trade pact currently being negotiated by nine countries, including the U.S., Australia, Chile and Singapore. Kan, who has said he wants to make 2011 the start of an era of Japanese free trade, intends to reach a decision on entering the TPP by June. Kan appointed Banri Kaieda as his new trade minister, a firm believer in the benefits of Japan joining the TPP, replacing Akihiro Ohata, who adopted a more cautious stance toward the trade pact. Matsumura of The Japan Research Institute said the new Cabinet's economic and fiscal policy initiatives appear headed in the right direction, and Kan has made a wise decision to distance himself from the DPJ's campaign pledges in the 2009 general election. "The campaign manifesto was a hotchpotch of various policies lacking clear direction. But the DPJ won the election, so it was put in a position where it had to realize the pledges, which many party members now realize require review," said Matsumura. "I think the policy direction is correct," he said. "The economic situation has changed, so priorities need to be re-evaluated." Meanwhile, Saito from Tokai Tokyo Securities said he has been deeply disappointed so far with the DPJ-led government, which has proved unable to cut wasteful spending as much as it promised, and does not have high hopes for the new Cabinet. While promoting the TPP and fiscal reconstruction are the right steps, the DPJ is divided over these policies as many in the party claim there was no mention of a sales tax hike in the campaign platform and fear the TPP risks devastating the agriculture industry, Saito said.


Futenma is the sticking issue in Japanese politics-it prevents further progress and gaining of strength by the DPJ.
Japan Times 12-25(Shinji Fukukawa, 12/24/10, " Revitalizing national politics ", [[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20101225sf.html]])
Saturday, Dec. 25, 2010 The Democratic Party of Japan realized a dramatic change of government with its great win in the Lower House election in August 2009. The DPJ victory came when policy evolution in the later years of the coalition administration by the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito stagnated, prompting mass media and leading intellectuals to call for change of government to pave the way for revitalization of national politics. However, the administration of Yukio Hatoyama, which took power in September 2009, harmed Japan-U.S. relations over the issue of the relocation the U.S. Marine Corps' Air Station Futenma in Okinawa Island and was slow in taking stimulus measures to help buoy the economy. His flip-flops worsened the political situation. He resigned in July 2010. The succeeding administration of Naoto Kan gained a high approval rate of over 60 percent at its inception. But Kan's vacillating remarks about the consumption tax and other major policy matters exposed his lack of leadership. Consequently, the DPJ suffered a serious defeat in the Upper House election in September. The resultant divided Diet with the DPJ keeping majority strength in the Lower House and the opposition forces dominating the Upper House has made the management of Diet business very difficult.Under Kan, the Futenma issue remains unresolved and the restoration of mutual trust between Japan and the U.S. has been very slow. Mutual distrust between Japan and China has also grown due to Kan's bungled handling of the incident involving a Chinese trawler that rammed two Japan Coast Guard ships off the Senkaku Islands. The situation surrounding Japan worsened after Russian President Dmitry Medvedev visited the Russian-held Japanese island Kunashiri off Hokkaido and North Korea's artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island of South Korea. The Kan Cabinet failed to take prompt measures to deal with these problems. The government managed to get the Diet approval for the fiscal 2010 supplemental budget in November but many other important bills were not put to vote. Little progress has been made on the question of DPJ former chief Ichiro Ozawa's political funds scandal, despite strong public criticism. Deflationary trends persist and college graduates face a dire employment situation. Social security reforms and financial rehabilitation have stagnated. As a result, the Kan Cabinet's approval rating has plummeted to about 20 percent. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democratic Party and other opposition parties continue to criticize the Kan administration without presenting their own positive national vision or specific policy proposals. First of all, there is a decline in the capabilities of political parties. Although the DPJ's manifesto was just a list of pledges aimed at winning votes rather than a real policy vision, the Kan administration's ongoing preoccupation with it has prevented it from devising and carrying out any appropriate policy measures. It is obvious that the government cannot carry out appropriate policy measures as long as it continues to deny much of what previous administrations have done and disregard the need to ensure continuity of foreign policy. The strength of a ruling party is based primarily on its ability to use personnel who are rich in experience and intelligence to gather information and work out policies. None of the nation's existing parties have such credentials. Second, the Kan administration is hobbled by inefficiencies. The DPJ tried to promote governance in which politicians' initiatives take a central role in place of reliance on bureaucrats. But that attempt dampened bureaucrats' enthusiasm for supporting the administration and pushed the Cabinet into a state of information starvation. The DPJ has also avoided dialogue with leading business lobbies. An administration needs to develop a system in which information, knowledge and wisdom can be efficiently collected at home and abroad, and optimal policies can be developed. But the Kan administration is far from this state. Third, the qualities of current political leaders are weak. To promote policies, it is necessary to think big and act locally as the established tactical theory in the "go" game advises. But the Kan administration is engaging in localized battles before making strategic preparations. As a result, its policies have bogged down, and it's failing to win the respect of other countries. Top national leaders have a responsibility to ensure the security of the nation and its people, enrich the country and play a responsible role in international affairs. To do so, leaders must paint a clear vision for the future, develop holistically optimum policy measures and have the courage to assert national interests in talks with leaders of other countries. Both the ruling and opposition parties suffer from a shortage of such high caliber politicians. Given the current political situation, is there any way to revitalize the nation's politics? Plans for a partial coalition and a grand coalition are on the tips of people's tongues, but it appears difficult to find politicians capable of taking a leading role in realizing them. If that proves to be the case, we have no choice but to wait for the strength of political parties to grow, and highly capable and talented politicians to appear through the process of successive government changes. To drive such a political evolution forward, people must develop a stronger interest in politics. Journalism can play a significant role in this process. Rather than write stories designed to satisfy the public's curiosity about what is happening in the political scene, journalists should engage in political reporting that stimulates public discussion on policy matters and encourages people to make choices on policy options. Another way to revive political vitality is to return to the multiple-seat constituency electoral system. The present single-seat system gives rise to populism and make it difficult to promote serious policy discussions. The multiple-seat constituency system would make it easier for politicians to assert their own political beliefs and present their policy proposals. This in turn would bolster the strength of political parties in terms of policy development and human resources. Some skeptics fear that the multiple-seat system might revive old-style factional politics and trigger political funding irregularities. But given today's intense social scrutiny, such a result is highly unlikely. In any case, it is urgently necessary to promote a national debate on how to revitalize politics in this country.


Not passing the TPP cause deflation.
Diplomat 11/9 (Andy Sharp, The Diplomat is the premier international current-affairs magazine for the Asia-Pacific region. Since its launch in 2002, it has been dedicated to quality analysis and commentary on events occurring in Asia and around the world. Now published exclusively online, The Diplomat reaches an influential audience of commentators, policymakers and academics with its in-depth treatment of regional issues.11/9/10, " Japan Edges Toward TPP Talks ", [[http://the-diplomat.com/tokyo-notes/2010/11/10/japan-edges-toward-tpp-talks/]])
Driving along a nondescript stretch of road in Tochigi Prefecture yesterday, I was regularly greeted with flashing signs proudly announcing the heightened security measures in place for the APEC summit this week, even though the meet will take place in Yokohama—more than 150 kilometres away. Japan is taking this event very seriously and apparently leaving nothing to chance. Fearing a terrorist attack or other headaches induced by right-wing protestors or the usual swarms of tree-huggers attracted to such talking shops, more than 20,000 police officers from forces across the nation have been mobilized for the event. Rubbish bins have been removed from train stations and security guards are reportedly carrying out body searches on those in the vicinity of the venue. Thousands of posters (maybe more) have been pinned on walls and notice boards across the vast expanse of the Tokyo metropolitan area (which includes Yokohama) reassuring the public that the state won't let anything untoward happen to the 18 heads of state and other dignitaries attending. While the security of high-profile visitors is (as it should be) of the highest priority, one does sense that the measures are perhaps a little overzealous. Or, perhaps, as one of my companions the previous night in rural Tochigi gurned at me over a mug of shochu liquor—‘a waste of taxpayer money.' The government's tendency to err on the side of caution can also be seen in its divided stance over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a multilateral free trade agreement that will be a major talking point at the APEC meeting. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Naoto Kan pledged to bring the nation into the initiative, which would remove Japan's trade barriers with its four original members (Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore) and other nations in negotiations to join, including Australia, Malaysia, Peru, Vietnam and the blue fin tuna of the world economy—the United States. But Tokyo has been notoriously slow on the uptake in liberalizing trade. Japan lags behind South Korea, which has boosted its trade (and other ties) with the United States and the European Union through the recent signing of FTAs. And with the yen continuing to strengthen against the US dollar and other major currencies, relaxing tariffs on exports could help businesses struggling to sell overseas. Japan's captains of industry also agree on this point. The chairman of the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren), the country's largest business lobby, urged the government Monday to join the accord by 2015. Hiromasa Yonekura told Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara that negotiating to join the TPP would boost Japan's hand in FTA talks with China, South Korea and the EU. But, as always, pitching their forks into the ground on the issue of free trade are the nation's overprotected farmers (the import tariff on rice is close to 800 percent) and agricultural lobbies. As joining the TPP would mean the removal of tariffs on all agricultural products within 10 years, they worry for their livelihoods in what they say would become a market flooded with cheap imports. Some lawmakers from Kan's Democratic Party of Japan are also pulling against membership of the TPP with the strength of a prize bull. Their reasoning is selfish. For years, previous Liberal Democratic Party governments kept tariffs on imports high, giving them the backing of agricultural cooperatives and, in turn, a guarantee of the rural vote. This pandering to the farm lobby helped keep the LDP in power for decades and the more urbane DPJ is keen to boost its showing in the regions. But to have its free trade cake and eat it, the government may have to find an imaginative means of supporting farmers. The government could once more learn from its South Korean neighbours, for example, and negotiate subsidies to farmers to help make up for the dismantling of an economic bulwark. While such talks could be as sticky, moving toward more open trade could produce a more bountiful crop for the nation as a whole. Maehara, a city slicker, echoes this sentiment. ‘If we don't seriously consider opening the nation up, we could soon lose our competitive edge,' he said in a recent speech. ‘(By not joining the TPP) aren't we sacrificing much of the 98.5 percent (of the economy that isn't primary industry) for the 1.5 percent that is?' An overcautious stance in the Yokohama talks, or a timid approach to the farmers, could result in Japanese business travelling a very mundane road in the coming years.


Yen deflation causes unemployment and destruction of Japanese manufacturing base-and only way to prevent would be through further stimulus.
Jackson 10-17 (Paul, writes for the diplomat which is an online and print magazine of east asian affairs, “Yen set to keep rising.” [[http://the-diplomat.com/tokyo-notes/2010/10/17/yen-set-to-keep-rising/#more-1074]]
Reports this week that Toyota is considering moving its production of Corollas overseas is another worrying sign that, with no end in sight for the appreciation of the yen, Japanese manufacturers will speed up their shift to overseas production.
With the market twitching at every remark made by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, the indications are that the yen is going to rise even higher with the likely unveiling of additional quantitative easing measures by the Fed in early November. It seems only a matter of time before the 80 yen to the dollar mark is breached.
The report about the possible Toyota move comes after recent comments by Canon, Mitsubishi, Honda and Suzuki about boosting overseas production to counter the soaring yen, which big players such as Toyota predicted would hover around the 90 yen mark this business year. Such estimates are now a distant dream with the yen trading in Tokyo around the 81.24 yen mark at 5 p.m. Friday. The head of Mitsubishi Motors slammed the government on Thursday for not understanding the burden the high yen was having on manufacturers.
One of the main concerns over major companies moving their production operations overseas is the detrimental effect this will have on employment levels in Japan, a fear expressed to me recently by an official at Nippon Keidanren, Japan’s national business association.
Now with the yen even higher than it was a month ago when Japan made its 2.2 trillion yen market intervention, the question is what can be done to halt the yen’s rise.
Some hopes are pinned on the upcoming meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers starting Friday in South Korea. Can they come up with some basic currency intervention guidelines or ideas for cooperation? That’s what Prime Minister Naoto Kan is hoping for, according to a report in the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan’s main dailies.
With the United States and China at odds over currency matters, though, surely the result will be another of the vague catch-all statements that so often characterize these international talking shops.
While Japan probably has the best case to plead when it comes to intervening in the currency market, it has also criticized other nations’ market dealings drawing the ire of South Korea and China. Another intervention before the G20 FM meet now seems unlikely given that it would weaken Japan’s ability to argue for fair play. And while Tokyo’s first intervention may not have generated as much criticism as might have been expected, further interventions might see a less passive response.
But when the dollar starts trading below 80 yen, surely Japan will have to intervene again. Having already revealed its weapon, though, second time around it might need to use more money to achieve the same effect. So what else can be done other than direct intervention in the market?
If the upward pressure on the yen fails to subside after the Fed’s likely QE2 measures have been put into action, perhaps the Bank of Japan should be encouraged to respond in kind. In other words, now the BOJ has cast aside, for the moment at least, its upper limit on asset buying, maybe it should look well beyond the 5 trillion yen figure it announced on October 5.

Either way, let’s hope something gives soon, because for each day the yen remains at its current levels, the closer we come to the hollowing out of Japan’s domestic manufacturing base.


Not joining the TPP will devastate Japan’s economy.
Daily Yomiuri 11/11 (11/11/10, " TPP--Opening the door / Japan risks being left behind ", [[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/business/T101111006172.htm]])
This is the second in a three-part series on the issues surrounding Japan's participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership strategic economic agreement. South Korea's ambitious strategy on free trade and economic partnerships continue to place that nation one step or even two steps ahead of Japan, a situation that deeply concerns Japanese industries. Delivering a lecture in Tokyo on Wednesday, Canon Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Fujio Mitarai made clear his push for Japan's participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement currently being negotiated by nine other nations. "For Japan to maintain economic growth, an environment in which corporations can conduct business across national boundaries is needed. To that end, I really hope the government will decide to participate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement," said Mitarai, who until May was also chairman of the Japan Business Federation (Nippon Keidanren). The TPP began as a four-nation agreement between Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore, which are now negotiating an expanded TPP with Australia, Malaysia, Peru, the United States and Vietnam. Together, those nine nations account for 27.7 percent of nominal global gross domestic product, and 25.7 percent of Japan's total exports by volume. Some fear that if Japan does not join the TPP at an early stage, the international competitiveness of Japanese firms in export-oriented industries such as automobiles, home appliances and heavy machinery--which are central to the foundation of this nation's economy--could fall dramatically. The decision on whether to join the TPP promises to have far greater impact than the corresponding choice on any bilateral free trade agreement or economic partnership agreement. Executives from the industries mentioned have been desperately lobbying the government to sign up to the TPP sooner rather than later. At the Prime Minister's Office on Tuesday, during a meeting of the Roundtable on the Promotion of Inward Investment, Toshiba Corp. Chairman Atsutoshi Nishida told Prime Minister Naoto Kan early participation in the TPP was of vital importance. Within Japanese industries, South Korea is often referred to as the "imaginary enemy." That country is well in front of Japan in terms of FTA strategy. Seoul promotes FTAs as "the key to prosperity." In October, South Korea and the European Union concluded an FTA. That deal is expected to see the EU cut tariffs on nearly all imports from South Korea to zero by 2016. South Korea has also concluded an FTA with the United States, although it is still awaiting ratification by both countries. Full-fledged negotiations between China and South Korea toward conclusion of an FTA are expected to start in the first half of next year. Japan, in marked contrast, does not even have FTA negotiations scheduled with the United States or the EU. In France, the average price of a Panasonic liquid-crystal display TV of 40 to 42 inches is 1,105 euros (about 125,000 yen), according to the Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry. However, a comparable product from South Korea's Samsung Electronics costs 1,003 euros--a difference of more than 100 euros (about 11,000 yen). Without EU tariffs, the imported Samsung product will cost 863 euros (about 97,800 yen)--a price with which Japanese products will obviously be unable to compete. The automobile industry is also expected to suffer if Japan does not become an early participant in the TPP. Combined, the automobile markets in countries and territories with which South Korea has concluded or is negotiating FTAs or EPAs total 40.6 million units. Meanwhile, the combined size of the markets in India, Mexico and the handful of other countries with which Japan has concluded FTAs or EPAs comes to just 8 million units. This disadvantage of more than 30 million units will not be reduced unless Japan looks seriously into market liberalization. A scenario in which Japan does not join the TPP and fails to conclude EPAs with the EU and China, and South Korea's FTAs with the United States, EU and China take effect, would be economically disastrous for Japan, according to METI estimates. According to the ministry's projections, exports of automobiles, machinery and electronics--this nation's three major industries--will decline. Real GDP for 2020 will be pushed down by 10.5 trillion yen, and 812,000 jobs will be lost. An investment promotion program to be compiled by the government's inward investment roundtable might stipulate early participation in the TPP and promotion of EPAs, as well as corporate tax cuts. According to Nippon Keidanren estimates, such a program could see total domestic capital investment rise to about 104.4 trillion yen in 2020, about 60 percent up from last year's 62.7 trillion yen. Many manufacturers are now accelerating plans to transfer production bases to other countries, in response to the considerable decline in their competitiveness caused by the yen's appreciation. It is no exaggeration to say the state of the domestic manufacturing sector 10 years from now will be decided entirely by how Japan proceeds on the TPP. The government has little time left to make a decision.


Japanese economic collapse will destroy international free trade and make it so that the US will eventually default on its debt-economic collapse and kills democracy
Auslin 9 (Michael, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. [[@http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123483257056995903.html]]) As Hillary Clinton visits Tokyo for her first trip as secretary of state, she will find a country in the midst of its worst recession in 50 years. Japan's economy is contracting across the board: Exports have cratered, industrial production is on track to plummet 30% from a year ago, and the Japanese government projects that GDP will drop 12% from last year. The world's second largest economy, Japan is also the largest holder of U.S. Treasury bonds. Recently, many economists and scholars in the U.S. have been looking backward to Japan's banking disaster of the 1990s, hoping to learn lessons for America's current crisis. Instead, they should be looking ahead to what might occur if Japan goes into a full-fledged depression. The Opinion Journal Widget Download Opinion Journal's widget and link to the most important editorials and op-eds of the day from your blog or Web page. If Japan's economy collapses, supply chains across the globe will be affected and numerous economies will face severe disruptions, most notably China's. China is currently Japan's largest import provider, and the Japanese slowdown is creating tremendous pressure on Chinese factories. Just last week, the Chinese government announced that 20 million rural migrants had lost their jobs. Closer to home, Japan may also start running out of surplus cash, which it has used to purchase U.S. securities for years. For the first time in a generation, Tokyo is running trade deficits -- five months in a row so far. The political and social fallout from a Japanese depression also would be devastating. In the face of economic instability, other Asian nations may feel forced to turn to more centralized -- even authoritarian -- control to try to limit the damage. Free-trade agreements may be rolled back and political freedom curtailed. Social stability in emerging, middle-class societies will be severely tested, and newly democratized states may find it impossible to maintain power. Progress toward a more open, integrated Asia is at risk, with the potential for increased political tension in the world's most heavily armed region. This is the backdrop upon which the U.S. government is set to expand the national debt by a trillion dollars or more. Without massive debt purchases by Japan and China, the U.S. may not be able to finance the cost of the stimulus package, creating a trapdoor under the U.S. economy. So far, Japan's politicians have been unable to find a way out of this mess. While another $53 billion stimulus package works its way through parliament, fully one-third of Japan's prefectures have instituted emergency economic stabilization measures. But the big issues elude short-term solutions. Though Japan's leaders are currently cutting back on military expenditures and domestic services, they're unable to agree on budgets or reform plans. They have no strategic road map for reining in the yen, opening up to international competition, or taking an economic leadership role in Asia that will promote growth and strengthen democratic, market-oriented societies. Things don't have to turn out this way. If Japan's leaders can craft a monetary policy that ends Japan's deflationary spiral by carefully expanding the money supply, recommit to structural reform, and halt the yen's rise, they can jump-start economic growth. They should also ignore the powerful domestic agriculture lobby and embrace a robust free-trade agenda, which would help them as well as the rest of Asia. Mrs. Clinton's visit cannot be a simple photo opportunity. This trip needs to result in a clear U.S.-Japan approach to restoring confidence and rebuilding a robust and open international system. Without action, Japan and America may go over the cliff together, dragging Asia and the world down with them.


Hostile trade blocks and global warfare are inevitable without a strong multilateral trade system lead by the United States.
Panitchpakd 04i, Secretary-General Conference on Trade & Development, 2/26/04, Speech Before National Press Club, “American Leadership and the World Trade Organization: What is the Alternative?”, [[[http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spsp_e/spsp22_e.htm]] Accessed April 22, 2009]
I can sum up my message today in three sentences: The United States, more than any single country, created the world trading system. The US has never had more riding on the strength of that system. And US leadership — especially in the current Doha trade talks — is indispensable to the system's success. It is true that as the WTO's importance to the world economy increases, so too does the challenge of making it work: there are more countries, more issues, trade is in the spot light as never before. But the fiction that there is an alternative to the WTO — or to US leadership — is both naïve and dangerous. Naïve because it fails to recognize that multilateralism has become more — not less — important to advancing US interests. Dangerous because it risks undermining the very objectives the US seeks — freer trade, stronger rules, a more open and secure world economy. The Doha Round is a crucial test. The core issues — services, agriculture, and industrial tariffs — are obviously directly relevant to the US. America is highly competitive in services — the fastest growing sector of the world economy, and where the scope for liberalization is greatest. In agriculture too the US is competitive across many commodities — but sky-high global barriers and subsidies impede and distort agricultural trade. Industrial tariffs also offer scope for further liberalization — especially in certain markets and sectors. But what is at stake in these talks is more than the economic benefits that would flow from a successful deal. The real issue is the relevance of the multilateral trading system. Its expanded rules, broader membership, and binding dispute mechanism means that the new WTO — created less than ten years ago — is pivotal to international economic relations. But this means that the costs of failure are also higher — with ramifications that can be felt more widely. Advancing the Doha agenda would confirm the WTO as the focal point for global trade negotiations, and as the key forum for international economic cooperation. The credibility of the institution would be greatly enhanced. But if the Doha negotiations stumble, doubts may grow, not just about the WTO's effectiveness, but about the future of multilateralism in trade. This should be a major concern to the US for two reasons: First, the US is now integrated with the world economy as never before. A quarter of US GDP is tied to international trade, up from 10 per cent in 1970 — the largest such increase of any developed economy over this period. A third of US growth since 1990 has been generated by trade. And America's trade is increasingly global in scope — 37 per cent with Canada and Mexico, 23 per cent with Europe, 27 per cent with Asia. Last year alone, exports to China rose by almost 30 per cent. The US has also grown more reliant on the rules of the multilateral system to keep world markets open. Not only has it initiated more WTO dispute proceedings than any other country — some 75 since 1995 — according to USTR it has also won or successfully settled most of the cases it has brought. The point is this: even the US cannot achieve prosperity on its own; it is increasingly dependent on international trade, and the rules-based economic order that underpins it. As the biggest economy, largest trader and one of the most open markets in the world, it is axiomatic that the US has the greatest interest in widening and deepening the multilateral system. Furthermore, expanding international trade through the WTO generates increased global prosperity, in turn creating yet more opportunities for the US economy. The second point is that strengthening the world trading system is essential to America's wider global objectives. Fighting terrorism, reducing poverty, improving health, integrating China and other countries in the global economy — all of these issues are linked, in one way or another, to world trade. This is not to say that trade is the answer to all America's economic concerns; only that meaningful solutions are inconceivable without it. The world trading system is the linchpin of today's global order — underpinning its security as well as its prosperity. A successful WTO is an example of how multilateralism can work. Conversely, if it weakens or fails, much else could fail with it. This is something which the US — at the epicentre of a more interdependent world — cannot afford to ignore. These priorities must continue to guide US policy — as they have done since the Second World War. America has been the main driving force behind eight rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, including the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the creation of the WTO. The US — together with the EU — was instrumental in launching the latest Doha Round two years ago. Likewise, the recent initiative, spearheaded by Ambassador Zoellick, to re-energize the negotiations and move them towards a successful conclusion is yet another example of how essential the US is to the multilateral process — signalling that the US remains committed to further liberalization, that the Round is moving, and that other countries have a tangible reason to get on board. The reality is this: when the US leads the system can move forward; when it withdraws, the system drifts. The fact that US leadership is essential, does not mean it is easy. As WTO rules have expanded, so too has as the complexity of the issues the WTO deals with — everything from agriculture and accounting, to tariffs and telecommunication. The WTO is also exerting huge gravitational pull on countries to join — and participate actively — in the system. The WTO now has 146 Members — up from just 23 in 1947 — and this could easily rise to 170 or more within a decade. Emerging powers like China, Brazil, and India rightly demand a greater say in an institution in which they have a growing stake. So too do a rising number of voices outside the system as well. More and more people recognize that the WTO matters. More non-state actors — businesses, unions, environmentalists, development NGOs — want the multilateral system to reflect their causes and concerns. A decade ago, few people had even heard of the GATT. Today the WTO is front page news. A more visible WTO has inevitably become a more politicized WTO. The sound and fury surrounding the WTO's recent Ministerial Meeting in Cancun — let alone Seattle — underline how challenging managing the WTO can be. But these challenges can be exaggerated. They exist precisely because so many countries have embraced a common vision. Countries the world over have turned to open trade — and a rules-based system — as the key to their growth and development. They agreed to the Doha Round because they believed their interests lay in freer trade, stronger rules, a more effective WTO. Even in Cancun the great debate was whether the multilateral trading system was moving fast and far enough — not whether it should be rolled back. Indeed, it is critically important that we draw the right conclusions from Cancun — which are only now becoming clearer. The disappointment was that ministers were unable to reach agreement. The achievement was that they exposed the risks of failure, highlighted the need for North-South collaboration, and — after a period of introspection — acknowledged the inescapable logic of negotiation. Cancun showed that, if the challenges have increased, it is because the stakes are higher. The bigger challenge to American leadership comes from inside — not outside — the United States. In America's current debate about trade, jobs and globalization we have heard a lot about the costs of liberalization. We need to hear more about the opportunities. We need to be reminded of the advantages of America's openness and its trade with the world — about the economic growth tied to exports; the inflation-fighting role of imports, the innovative stimulus of global competition. We need to explain that freer trade works precisely because it involves positive change — better products, better job opportunities, better ways of doing things, better standards of living. While it is true that change can be threatening for people and societies, it is equally true that the vulnerable are not helped by resisting change — by putting up barriers and shutting out competition. They are helped by training, education, new and better opportunities that — with the right support policies — can flow from a globalized economy. The fact is that for every job in the US threatened by imports there is a growing number of high-paid, high skill jobs created by exports. Exports supported 7 million workers a decade ago; that number is approaching around 12 million today. And these new jobs — in aerospace, finance, information technology — pay 10 per cent more than the average American wage. We especially need to inject some clarity — and facts — into the current debate over the outsourcing of services jobs. Over the next decade, the US is projected to create an average of more than 2 million new services jobs a year — compared to roughly 200,000 services jobs that will be outsourced. I am well aware that this issue is the source of much anxiety in America today. Many Americans worry about the potential job losses that might arise from foreign competition in services sectors. But it’s worth remembering that concerns about the impact of foreign competition are not new. Many of the reservations people are expressing today are echoes of what we heard in the 1970s and 1980s. But people at that time didn’t fully appreciate the power of American ingenuity. Remarkable advances in technology and productivity laid the foundation for unprecedented job creation in the 1990s and there is no reason to doubt that this country, which has shown time and again such remarkable potential for competing in the global economy, will not soon embark again on such a burst of job-creation. America's openness to service-sector trade — combined with the high skills of its workforce — will lead to more growth, stronger industries, and a shift towards higher value-added, higher-paying employment. Conversely, closing the door to service trade is a strategy for killing jobs, not saving them. Americans have never run from a challenge and have never been defeatist in the face of strong competition. Part of this challenge is to create the conditions for global growth and job creation here and around the world. I believe Americans realize what is at stake. The process of opening to global trade can be disruptive, but they recognize that the US economy cannot grow and prosper any other way. They recognize the importance of finding global solutions to shared global problems. Besides, what is the alternative to the WTO? Some argue that the world's only superpower need not be tied down by the constraints of the multilateral system. They claim that US sovereignty is compromised by international rules, and that multilateral institutions limit rather than expand US influence. Americans should be deeply sceptical about these claims. Almost none of the trade issues facing the US today are any easier to solve unilaterally, bilaterally or regionally. The reality is probably just the opposite. What sense does it make — for example — to negotiate e-commerce rules bilaterally? Who would be interested in disciplining agricultural subsidies in a regional agreement but not globally? How can bilateral deals — even dozens of them — come close to matching the economic impact of agreeing to global free trade among 146 countries? Bilateral and regional deals can sometimes be a complement to the multilateral system, but they can never be a substitute. There is a bigger danger. By treating some countries preferentially, bilateral and regional deals exclude others — fragmenting global trade and distorting the world economy. Instead of liberalizing trade — and widening growth — they carve it up. Worse, they have a domino effect: bilateral deals inevitably beget more bilateral deals, as countries left outside are forced to seek their own preferential arrangements, or risk further marginalization. This is precisely what we see happening today. There are already over two hundred bilateral and regional agreements in existence, and each month we hear of a new or expanded deal. There is a basic contradiction in the assumption that bilateral approaches serve to strengthen the multilateral, rules-based system. Even when intended to spur free trade, they can ultimately risk undermining it. This is in no one's interest, least of all the United States. America led in the creation of the multilateral system after 1945 precisely to avoid a return to hostile blocs — blocs that had done so much to fuel interwar instability and conflict. America's vision, in the words of Cordell Hull, was that “enduring peace and the welfare of nations was indissolubly connected with the friendliness, fairness and freedom of world trade”. Trade would bind nations together, making another war unthinkable. Non-discriminatory rules would prevent a return to preferential deals and closed alliances multilateral trading system is too important to fail. The world depends on it. So does America.


Intensifying economic recession will push us over the brink toward apocalypse—crime, suicide, and mass devastation is inevitable
The Sunday Times, 2/1/09 (Judith Duffy, “Scotland’s health boss sees apocalypse now,” 2009, Lexis)
SCOTLAND'S most senior public health official has warned that "humanity is on a path towards unprecedented catastrophe" and the Scottish economy is sinking at a faster rate than at any time since the Great Depression.In an apocalyptic report to the Scottish government, Dr Laurence Gruer, NHS Health Scotland's director of public health science, warned that the recession is likely to have a devastating effect on social cohesion and health.He predicts a rise in levels of property crime, fraud, racism, drug abuse, child abuse, domestic violence, obesity, depression and suicide. Coupled with environmental factors such as the depletion of natural resources, he claims the downturn could have dire consequences for the population."This upheaval can be expected to create changes in socioeconomic conditions in Scotland of a magnitude not seen since the early 1980s ... the causes of the recession are unprecedented and the rapidity and severity of their onset are only matched by the Great Depression of 1929."Humanity is on a path towards catastrophe on an unprecedented scale but which has already been tasted by the devastated residents of coastal Bangladesh, Myanmar and Louisiana, by the idle fishermen of the shrinking Aral Sea and the respiratory casualties of numerous air polluted cities."Gruer blames the "have-itall" mindset of western consumerist societies and its impact on the environment and people in developing countries."The risk of depression and the possibility of suicide may increase when unemployment is combined with financial problems such as losing one's home or relationship breakdown," says his report."With many more people struggling to make ends meet, some may be tempted into property crime, fraud or drug dealing ... there may also be possible increases in wife and child abuse and neglect ... the potential for increased racism and other forms of discrimination and harassment against immigrants due to perceived competition for jobs should be anticipated and responded to." The report has been criticised by politicians, who warn that Gruer's language could cause unnecessary anxiety."In the circumstances, prophesying doom and gloom is not a constructive way forward, neither does it help people cope with the current problems," said Mary Scanlon, health spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservatives.."It is for the public authorities to give the best advice and support, rather than adding to anxiety and depression."Richard Simpson, Labour's public health spokesman, said: "Something so full of doom and gloom at a time of uncertainty creates a sense of despair that is unnecessary and inappropriate. Dr Gruer should stick to his specific remit on public health."Simpson added that the current economic crisis could not be compared to the Great Depression because of the vast improvements in the nation's health and the global response to the credit crunch.The Great Depression, the most severe economic slump in modern history, was triggered by the Wall Street crash.Gruer believes that the socioeconomic changes caused by the current crisis would be as significant as those brought in by Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s.He adds that the falling value of sterling could also lead to elderly people, who had planned to spend their retirement living abroad, returning to Scotland, adding to the burden on health and social services.


Democracy has caused peace and improved government globally, it is the most important tool for human survival.
Teune, American Academy of Political and Social Science 2 (Henry Teune, , “Global Democracy”, May, TOR)
GLOBALIZATION exploded in the 1990s following the second democratic revolution. That era of globalization began in the middle of the 1970s. It was signaled by the oil crisis of 1973, a massive increase in the debt of developing countries from loans processed by the oil importing countries, and the promise and then the reality of the opening of China. It took another decade before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the home of the last great secular communalisms of the twentieth century, and the embrace of democracy by its successor states. By that time, nearly all the political barriers to the encapsulation of the world into a single economic system were gone. Only then, at the beginning of the 1990s, did globalization receive general notice. But democratization and globalization, even though tied together in a cascade of visible changes, were treated more or less independently. They both, however, were part of broader developmental processes, locked in a dynamic relationship still to be understood fully. The main question of today is democracy on a global scale. The issues concerning global institutions and processes accountable to people everywhere have superseded those of national and local democracy of only a few years ago. It has long been believed that world development required including poor countries and populations into a global economy of growth, either to avoid the threat of angry disruptions or to sustain the moral underpinnings of capitalism. Today, an additional matter has been piled on top of this one: inclusion of the world's populations into global democratic institutions and political processes on a foundation of an expanded normative system of human rights. The outlines of a global democracy can be seen now only through visionary lenses. During the past three decades, social scientists and professional observers described an emerging global political economy, but without democracy.1 It took most of the 1990s to grasp that without democracy, globalization could not continue in a peaceful, orderly fashion. Democracy began to become the bedrock of the prosperity promised by globalization. It may well turn out to be the best invention for human survival and the betterment of everyday living. Indeed, in time, democracy in large-scale societies may be judged the most important discovery of the twentieth century since vaccines. Governments systematically killing their own peoples and nearly nonstop international wars of scale marked the first half of the twentieth century (Rummel 1996). By that century's end, the beginning of the institutionalization of a second democratic revolution, not only had major international wars ceased, but almost all governments openly subscribed to the principle that they should improve people's lives and should not kill, incarcerate, or expel them. As important was the muting of any credible national political challenges to rudimentary human rights. The killing of masses of people by legitimate authorities may be the most important international fact of the first half of the twentieth century. But the most important fact of this era of globalization is that almost all governments, save one or two, stopped doing that around the century's end, following the spread of democracy.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Two learning curves intersected in Tokyo this week when U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates came to town, part of a Northeast Asian swing that started in Beijing and will finish in Seoul.One curve is under way in Japan, where the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) is learning the difference between campaigning and governing. Ending a half-century of nearly uninterrupted conservative rule, the DPJ came to power in September 2009 vowing to forge a more "equal" relationship with its patron ally and put more emphasis on Japan's ties with Asian neighbors, particularly China and South Korea.The DPJ also pledged to reduce the burden of hosting U.S. bases placed on the people of Okinawa, where the bases occupy nearly a fifth of the island. The new government hoped to revisit the unimplemented 1996 agreement to move the helicopters and planes stationed at Futenma Marine air base, dangerously crowded in among apartment buildings and schools on the southern part of the island, to a new base built in its less densely populated northern half.Since taking power, </span><span class="underline">the DPJ has struggled to reconcile its electoral pledges with the reality of a serially provocative North Korea and an increasingly aggressive China.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Yukio Hatoyama's inability to manage the base issue with the United States became emblematic of his weak leadership, costing him the premiership after only nine months and contributing to the party's loss of the upper house of parliament last summer.Americans somewhat smugly congratulate Tokyo for its belated realism. Less acknowledged is Washington's own learning curve about both the realities of politics in Japan and the enduring value of the alliance. The early days of the DPJ administration were marked by barely disguised U.S. disdain for its political ineptitude and domestic troubles, and even, among some U.S. officials, expectations that a strategic condominium with China could eventually supplant the Cold War alliance with Japan.</span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Gates's successful role as alliance manager this week stands in stark contrast to his visit more than a year ago, in October 2009</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Back then, he came to bluntly tell the Japanese to drop any talk of reopening the Okinawa base issue. "This may not be the perfect alternative for anyone," Gates said, "but it is the best alternative for everyone, and it is time to move on." He dismissed any other options as "politically untenable and operationally unworkable."</span><span class="underline">As for the alliance, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Gates forcefully reminded his Japanese hosts that Americans were there to protect their country</span> -- allowing the Japanese to spend very little on their own self-defense over the past half-century</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. At the same time, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Obama administration officials talked openly about Japan's diminishing importance</span>, hinting at China's potential as a new strategic partner</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A senior State Department official told the Washington Post that the U.S. had "grown comfortable" with the idea of Japan as a constant in U.S. relations with the region. It no longer fills that role, he said, adding ominously that "</span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the hardest thing right now is not China -- it's Japan</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">."</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">The March 2010 sinking of a South Korean corvette, the Cheonan, shook that illusory view of the region. China's decision to back Pyongyang and its vocal opposition to U.S. naval deployments in the Yellow Sea surprised some in Washington. Meanwhile the DPJ government in Tokyo lined up strongly behind Seoul, as it did later after North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island last November. The new administration of Prime Minister Naoto Kan, Hatoyama's successor, got its own shock when Beijing purposely escalated tensions over the arrest of a Chinese fishing-boat captain following a collision near Japanese-controlled islands in the disputed oil and gas rich waters of the East China Sea.By last fall, talk of a "strategic partnership" with China had been replaced by a new emphasis on bolstering traditional Cold War-era cooperation among Japan, South Korea, and the United States. In October, ahead of the president's visit to Japan, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell admitted that the "learning process is not confined just to Tokyo."Campbell told reporters in Tokyo that the difficulties of the past year served as "a reminder to the United States [of] how badly we need a good relationship with Japan" to deal with the challenges in Asia. "It is critical for this generation of American policymakers to in no way take Japan for granted," he said, in an obvious swipe at more Sino-centric colleagues back in Washington. Those two learning curves visibly crossed during Gates's visit to Tokyo this week. The Kan administration, fresh off talks in Seoul about strengthening security ties, showed much greater readiness to cooperate on regional security. It is ready to ease restrictions on export to third countries of missile-defense technology jointly developed by the two countries, a move the United States has sought. Gates offered his own upbeat vision of a renewed Japan-U.S. alliance in the 21st century: "While issues associated with Okinawa and Futenma have tended to dominate the headlines this past year," Gates </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 5pt; text-decoration: none;">[[@http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4753|told the press]]</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, "the U.S.-Japan defense alliance is broader, deeper, and indeed richer than any single issue. In this, the 51st year of the U.S.-Japan alliance, it is important to remember that ours is an enduring and equal partnership based on interests and values that unite our two peoples."</span> <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">As for the base issue, Gates was notably deferential to his hosts</span>. "We do understand that it is politically a complex matter in Japan and we intend to follow the lead of the Japanese government in working with the people of Okinawa to take their interests and their concerns into account." </span>This represents a real change of tone, if not policy, provided it is sustained. <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Having reached this point of intersection, Tokyo and Washington are no closer, however, to solving the problem that has bedeviled their relationship</span></span>. Reading <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Gates's</span></span> words carefully, he <span class="underline">s<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">till insists on the base being moved to the proposed Henoko location</span></span>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">though perhaps at a slower tempo. Both governments are once again resorting to traditional tactics of trying to buy off islanders with economic subsidies, promises of construction contracts, and gestures such as moving noisy aircraft exercises elsewhere</span>. <span class="underline">Standing on the white-sand shores of the pristine bay, as I have, and looking out onto glistening blue waters into which the United States proposes to dump a mountain of sand and build the new air base, </span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it is easy to understand why this has no more chance of working now than it did during decades of conservative rule</span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. And the victory of anti-base candidates in elections in the last year on Okinawa, both in the locality around the proposed base and for the governorship, made this clear</span>. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The strategic importance of the U.S. presence in Japan, particularly of the 7th Fleet based on the main island of Honshu and the sprawling Kadena Air Base on Okinawa, is not in question. And given recent events, the availability of some Marine forces makes sense. But neither government has made a convincing case for why an entire Marine expeditionary force needs to remain on Okinawa. Ultimately</span>, <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">both governments are still going to have to find a real alternative to the base problem</span></span>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">while keeping their eyes focused firmly on the strategic horizon. The question is whether both Washington and Tokyo can take what they have learned so far and move forward to a more mature and yes, more equal, relationship. </span>


Futenma is pushing to a tipping point. 
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Daily Yomiuri 1/6 (</span></span>1/6/11, " Beefing up Japan-US alliance key to security ", http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/editorial/T110106002122.htm)
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Beefing up Japan-U.S. alliance key to security </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The Japan-U.S. alliance is now confronted with</span> two <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">major challenges</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">One is the task of rebuilding the bilateral ties that deteriorated after</span> the autumn <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">2009</span> launch of the government of former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The other is the question of how to cope with the alarmingly worsening security situation in East Asia, including security concerns over China and North Korea. These are tasks of the highest significance to Japan's diplomacy, the outcome of which could determine the fate of the Kan administration. The government must buckle down to resolving the problems with its utmost efforts. Solid, amicable relations between Tokyo and Washington must be rebuilt. Two keys to this project will be Prime Minister Kan's scheduled trip to the United States this spring and adoption of a joint statement regarding a deepening of the alliance between the two countries. The joint statement was earlier planned to be made last year, the 50th anniversary of the revision of the Japan-U.S. security treaty. But before that could happen, the issue of relocating functions of the U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station, Okinawa Prefecture, was driven into a logjam by Hatoyama's irresponsible call for a "Japan-U.S. alliance on an equal footing." With that, the task of deepening the alliance stalled. </span><span class="underline">Of crucial importance, of course, is not merely the announcement of the envisioned joint statement but its substance. The 1996 Japan-U.S. joint security declaration reconfirmed that the alliance between the two nations should be regarded as the foundation of the stability and prosperity of Asia even after the end of the Cold War</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The declaration also stated that the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation would be put under review. The planned joint statement should clarify the goals of 21st-century Japan-U.S. defense cooperation in a way that will facilitate steady and specific negotiations of the details. At the same time</span><span class="underline">, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">tangible progress on resolving the Futenma problem is an absolute must.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Okinawa Gov. </span><span class="underline">Hirokazu Nakaima won a second four-year term in the November 2010 election on the strength of his campaign pledge to "have the Futenma Air Station moved out of our prefecture." Thus, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it will be extremely difficult for Kan's administration to get the governor to change his mind in favor of having Futenma relocated within Okinawa Prefecture.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The difficulty, however, cannot be used to justify procrastination by the Kan Cabinet. </span><span class="underline">The administration instead should redouble its efforts to persuade Nakaima and other key parties concerned to accept the idea of relocating Futenma within the prefecture. By relocating the Futenma facility and transferring 8,000 marines from Okinawa Prefecture to Guam, the burden on residents in the prefecture in hosting U.S. military installations would be reduced</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This would be of epochal significance. Extensive areas of land will be reverted as a result of these moves. The central government should have serious, in-depth talks with local authorities on how to best use such land to create a new future for Okinawa Prefecture. The agenda for reorganizing U.S. forces in Japan include a number of other important items, such as the envisioned transfer of carrier-borne aircraft from the U.S. Atsugi Naval Air Facility, Kanagawa Prefecture, to the U.S. Marine Corps' Iwakuni Air Station, Yamaguchi Prefecture. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Accomplishing these tasks at a steady pace will reinforce the continuity and reliability of the Japan-U.S. alliance. A</span> string of incidents took place last year that raised security concerns for Japan</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Among them were an attack by North Korea on a South Korean warship, the shelling by the North of Yeonpyeong Island near a disputed sea border between the two Koreas, the incident of a Chinese trawler slamming into two Japan Coast Guard vessels and Chinese naval helicopters buzzing Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Outbreaks of similar incidents in 2011 should be no surprise to us.</span> </span>


However, Futenma will not cross the brink to alliance collapse.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">TOKYO — </span><span class="underline">Striking a conciliatory tone on an issue that has divided Japan and the United States, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Thursday that the Obama administration would follow Tokyo's lead in working to relocate an American air base on Okinawa. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, center, at a wreath-laying ceremony for Japanese soldiers in Tokyo on Thursday. Related China: Gates Sees Disconnect Between Military Leaders (January 14, 2011) </span><span class="underline">During talks with Japanese leaders in Tokyo, Mr. Gates said he also discussed a sophisticated new antimissile system that the United States is jointly developing with the Japanese</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and the two nations' response to North Korea's recent military provocations against the South. But a top item on the agenda was the relocation of the United States Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, an emotional issue here that drove an uncharacteristic wedge between the allies last year when the prime minister at the time, Yukio Hatoyama, wavered on whether to keep the base on Okinawa. While the two nations finally agreed in May to relocate the noisy helicopter base to a less populated part of Okinawa by 2014, local resistance has made that time frame look increasingly unrealistic. On Thursday, </span><span class="underline">Mr. Gates said the administration did not want the Futenma issue to overshadow the countries' overall security alliance</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which last year reached its 50th anniversary. </span><span class="underline">He signaled that the United States was willing to be flexible in allowing Tokyo to resolve the domestic political resistance to the relocation plan. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “We do understand that it is politically a complex matter in Japan,” he said after meeting Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa. “And we intend to follow the lead of the Japanese government in working with the people of Okinawa to take their interests and their concerns into account.” </span><span class="underline">The softer tone is a departure from Mr. Gates's visit to Tokyo in October 2009, when he pushed Mr. Hatoyama's fledgling government to honor an earlier deal to relocate the base on Okinawa. Those pressure tactics backfired, creating resentment in the government that the United States was trying to bully it. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Mr. Hatoyama eventually stepped down amid criticism that he had mishandled the alliance. His successor, Prime Minister Naoto Kan, has worked to strengthen security ties with Tokyo's traditional protector. At Keio University in Tokyo on Friday, Mr. Gates said the rising tensions in the region, including North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and China's expanding military, made it essential to fortify the security alliance between the United States and Japan. “Our alliance is more necessary, more relevant and more important than ever,” he said. He said it was essential for American military forces to remain in Japan, particularly as a deterrent against North Korean aggression and the ever-bolder Chinese armed forces. Without the American presence, he said, “North Korea's military provocations could be even more dangerous or worse.” China, he said, “might behave more assertively towards its neighbors.” On Thursday, Mr. Gates and Mr. Kitazawa discussed one of the nations' largest joint projects, the development of the antimissile system, which will be fired from ships to intercept larger ballistic missiles in midflight. Washington wants to be able to sell the system, known as the SM-3, to other nations, including possibly South Korea. But that would require Japan to rewrite its tight restrictions on weapons exports, a pillar of the nation's post-World War II pacifism. While Mr. Gates said Washington hoped to defray development costs by exporting the system, he was aware that this was a delicate matter in Japan. “It makes economic sense to make it available to others,” he said of the new interceptor. “But we understand there are certain processes that have to be gone through here.” Prime Minister Kan has called for a public debate on revising the restrictions, a step that many Japanese see as necessary for closer security cooperation with the United States in responding to China and North Korea. Mr. Gates, whose next stop is South Korea, said he had asked Japan for help in pressuring the North not to strike South Korea again. He has said he is worried that South Korea might feel forced to make a strong retaliation after already suffering North Korean attacks last year on an island and a warship. Pyongyang has denied involvement in the sinking of the warship. “It's a longstanding principle that every country has the right to protect itself and defend itself against an unprovoked attack,” Mr. Gates said. “The objective that we all have in common is, how do we prevent another provocation from taking place?”</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In addition to the question of whether the United States deployed nuclear weapons and conducted nuclear operations in Japan throughout the Cold War, there have also been frequent allegations among analysts and in news media that </span><span class="underline">U.S. and Japanese governments made one or more "secret agreements" allowing nuclear weapons to enter Japan despite the country's official nuclear ban</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The most widely reported of these allegations is that the United States and Japan, in connection with negotiation of the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, reached a secret unwritten understanding to permit U.S. warships to carry nuclear weapons in Japanese territorial waters. </span><span class="underline">The newly declassified documents obtained for this report provide ample evidence that Japanese governments willingly overlooked indications that its non-nuclear principles were violated</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The declassified material also confirms that the U.S. government and military authorities had concluded that Japanese governments tacitly allowed nuclear weapons to be onboard U.S. warships in Japanese ports. In some instances, Japanese officials were present onboard U.S. aircraft carriers to witness conspicuous displays of practice exercises for use of nuclear weapons. The newly declassified documentation even reveals instances in which Japanese government officials urged the United States to conceal the armament of the nuclear ships. </span><span class="underline">Nowhere is the Japanese willful disregard of U.S. nuclear weapons practices in Japan more evident than in the case of the Ticonderoga scandal in 1989</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which erupted after independent researchers obtained copies of official U.S. Navy documents revealing that in 1965 the aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) carried nuclear weapons into Japan. The report shows how the Japanese government simply decided to ignore the weight of the evidence and ride out the storm of public criticism. </span><span class="underline">The report's analysis of the newly declassified documents shows how Japan's quiet acquiescence to US nuclear weapons practices in Japan was an indirect result of the culture of secrecy created by the U.S. policy to "neither confirm nor deny" (NCND) any deployment of nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">The inauguration of the NCND policy coincided with Japan's early (but unsuccessful) efforts in the late-1950s to elicit U.S. assurances that it would not introduce nuclear weapons into Japan</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Although the United States said many times that it respected its security treaty and associated arrangements Japan, the United States never stated explicitly that it respected Japan's non-nuclear policy. Japan's acceptance of application of the NCND policy to Japanese ports enabled the United States to avoid falsely denying its nuclear operations in Japan. Thus, Japanese governments consistently exercised a contradictory, if not hypocritical, attitude toward U.S. nuclear weapons practices. In public, Japanese governments stood by the nuclear ban devoutly, and reiterated it each time the government was confronted with evidence of a violation. </span><span class="underline">In private</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span><span class="underline">governments maintained a more pro-nuclear disposition epitomized by tacit acceptance of the nuclear ambiguity demanded by the NCND policy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The coexistence of these two contradictory positions imposed a burden on Japanese policymakers and created a tension in U.S.-Japan security relations whose diplomatic consequences resonate even to this day. Although the arrangement accommodated conflicting political and security imperatives of the day, its perpetuation has damaged the credibility of the U.S.-Japan military alliance among the Japanese public. The U.S. government, like the public in general, was aware of the dilemma imposed on Japanese governments each time a ship visit occurred. However, the United States continued to insist on complete secrecy concerning its nuclear weapons practices, leaving Japanese authorities to deal with the political fallout. Forced to choose between ignoring its own nuclear ban or confronting its most important ally, for nearly five decades Japanese governments have sacrificed their own non-nuclear policy. U.S. Nuclear War Planning In Japan In addition to further verifying both the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons in Japan and official Japanese acquiescence to this presence, the newly declassified documents obtained for this report reveal for the first time that the United States also conducted nuclear war planning in Japan. Specifically, seven years after Japan and the United States signed the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, the Commander of the Pacific Command established the Pacific Operations Liaison Office (POLO) in Fifth Air Force facilities at Fuchu Air Station just outside Tokyo. POLO functioned as the liaison office for U.S. nuclear operations in the Western Pacific area from the mid-1960s until July 1972. During this period, POLO was responsible for the production of the Reconnaissance Plan portion of the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) for the Pacific Command (PACOM), as well as various other nuclear planning documents. By 1972, modernization of the SIOP planning process allowed Pacific Command to move the POLO function to Hawaii as part of an overall consolidation of SIOP planning. However, SIOP functions continued to take place on Japanese territory. For example, the Yokota and Kadena Air Bases in 1965 were designated as dispersal bases for U.S. Strategic Air Command's new airborne command post aircraft, codenamed BLUE EAGLE. Together with the U.S. Navy's own specially equipped C-130 aircraft, these command and control aircraft operations out of Japan functioned to provide the National Command Authority (the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other high-ranking military officials) with the technical means of authorizing and controlling SIOP and Theater nuclear war plans in the region. During the 1970s, BLUE EAGLE aircraft flying out of Japan practiced transferring nuclear launch orders to strategic nuclear submarines and nuclear-armed aircraft carriers operating in the waters around Japan. Such nuclear command and control exercises continued well into the 1990s, and probably continue even today. Unlike a visit of a nuclear-armed aircraft carrier, nuclear war planning and nuclear command and control exercises in Japan are much less visible to the public. Because of its relative ease of concealment, this aspect of Japanese involvement in U.S. nuclear weapons practices has received scant public scrutiny. The new evidence described in this report of the use of Japanese facilities for nuclear war planning therefore reveals the depths to which a non-nuclear country can find itself involved in nuclear arms rivalries -- whether it is aware of it or not -- by accepting the security guarantees of a nuclear-armed ally. Post Cold War Relevance The evidence from the newly declassified documents used to generate this report points clearly to the conclusion that Japanese governments lied to the public when they insisted they had no reason to suspect that the United States was violating Japan's non-nuclear policy. </span><span class="underline">The material upon which this report is based clearly shows that Japanese governments had sufficient information about U.S. nuclear weapons practices to allow them to act</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Throughout the Cold War, Japanese governments chose not to act on this knowledge. The legacy of Cold War era U.S.-Japanese nuclear relations provides important lessons about the long-term consequences of sustained concealment of the underlying realities of security alliances. </span><span class="underline">Regardless of the military rationale used at the time to justify the deployment of nuclear weapons in Japan, the secrecy and denials that accompanied the deployments created a political legacy that endures to this day</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the context of the current strengthening of the U.S.-Japan military alliance (as exemplified by the recent adoption of the new U.S.-Japan guidelines for security cooperation), </span><span class="underline">careful examination of this legacy becomes all the more vital</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">A complete and accurate accounting of history is necessary to salve the irritation of this legacy of secrecy, which could contribute to a future public backlash against the U.S. military presence in Japan</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is also a prerequisite to removing the opacity that continues to shroud the true nature of the present and planned security relationship between these two countries. Now that U.S. nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from the Pacific, </span><span class="underline">the opportunity exists for both Japan and the United States to revisit the premises of their security relationship, and especially to critically examine whether a Cold War-level reliance upon nuclear deterrence remains an effective means of achieving their mutual security goals</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">This imperative applies particularly to Japan, which publicly espouses nuclear disarmament, but also continues to accept the prospect of future U.S. transit of nuclear weapons through Japan and allows the United States to conduct routine nuclear command and control operations from its territory. A vital step toward such an examination of the future role of nuclear deterrence in the U.S.-Japan relationship would be for the Japanese government to provide greater access to its own information on the past</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ironically, most of the new information presented in this report comes not from Japan but from the United States -- the country that brought nuclear weapons into Japan. Information from the Japanese government's archives, on the other hand, is virtually unavailable and represents an important "missing link" in fully understanding the nuclear relationship that evolved between the two countries during the Cold War. With the Cold War now over, many justifications for maintaining this secrecy have evaporated. Japan now has the opportunity to allow drastically increased public access to this historical material. By doing so, it would help close the gaps in the history books, dispel rumors and myths, and facilitate a more open public debate on both sides of the Pacific about what the proper nature of the U.S.-Japanese military alliance should be.

Security is currently the core of the US Japan alliance-all other aspects depend on it. 
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Glosserman et al, ‘8</span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">After the halcyon days of the Bush-Koizumi era, </span><span class="underline">friends and supporters of the U.S.-Japan alliance look at the future with trepidation. A retreat from the high-water mark set by those two leaders was inevitable, but few suspected alliance relations would become the focal point of domestic politics in Japan as has occurred in recent months. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The prospect of a new U.S. president is always unnerving in Tokyo, especially given Japanese fears that a Democratic president would be less committed than a Republican to the alliance (which is not true, historically). </span><span class="underline">The U.S.-Japan relationship remains central to regional and global security</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The bilateral alliance is a cornerstone of U.S. engagement with Asia. The extended nuclear deterrent provides stability and assurance for Japan. Most significantly, however, the coordinated application of the two countries’ resources to international problems is a force multiplier: working together, Japan and the U.S. can do far more than they can by themselves. </span><span class="underline">Indeed, the most important challenge for alliance managers is the use of those considerable assets in new and creative ways</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We believe that with a fundamentally new approach, our two nations can rejuvenate, sustain and solidify our bilateral relationship, enhance regional and global security, and better the lives of our two countries’ citizens and those of millions more around the world. </span><span class="underline">Of course, the two countries must deal with traditional security concerns, most critically the maintenance of peace and stability in a region that is increasingly important to world trade and the global economy.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The projection of power remains vital, which means the U.S. must maintain its forward presence. The safety and security of the maritime domain is a key shared objective for two allies that rely on trade to survive. In short, the military dimension of the relationship remains critical. </span><span class="underline">Those points and the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan notwithstanding, we do not believe that military issues should be the single core of the relationship as it is now</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Just about every discussion of the future of the alliance starts with Japan’s contributions to international peacekeeping or multilateral security programs. </span><span class="underline">Political and legal-constitutional constraints invariably overshadow Japanese debates over such policies. While some change is inevitable, its pace is uncertain; bringing the alliance into those discussions tends to sidetrack the debate, raising questions about U.S. involvement and heightening sensitivities about Japanese sovereignty. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Those are unwanted distractions that can damage bilateral relations. </span><span class="underline">It is more efficient and more effective to focus elsewhere. There are new security concerns that are better suited to the capabilities of two of the world’s richest and most technologically advanced countries</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Cooperative policy approaches in several areas will enhance the strength of the U.S.-Japan bilateral relationship while promoting a positive image to other states. This approach will seek to improve the material conditions in regions of greatest need while developing policies that advance the national interests of the U.S. and Japan. </span>


And Space cooperation has been a large part of the Japan alliance-maintaining the security aspect is key.

<span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Space cooperation with Japan is key to cooperation with China. </span></span>
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dinerman 04</span></span>(Nathan, editor and publisher of spaceequity.com, “Dancing on eggs:US space cooperation with China.” http://www.thespacereview.com/article/212/1</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="underline">It should also be based on the overriding principal that the US will only cooperate with China in ways that do not upset our regional friend and allies</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this regard, </span><span class="underline">it would be best if we approached the Chinese almost entirely through our Japanese friends. The US and Japan should first work out the broad goals that both nations wish to achieve in their space relations with China, and then the US should let the Japanese take the lead in negotiating the whole package of cooperative agreements</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">There are recent precedents to the idea of letting another nation take the lead and allowing the US to follow.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Under Ronald Reagan</span><span class="underline">, the US allowed France to determine much of the US policy in Africa</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. When Aznar was prime minister of Spain, the US would often follow Madrid’s lead in its relations with Latin America. Giving Japan the leading role in these negotiations will not require any dramatic shifts in US policy, nor will it require the Japanese to commit to any new major expenditures. Instead, it will be the beginning of a long process—one that will involve much feeling out of the other side and a lot of subtle interactions. The US and Japan should first work out the broad goals that both nations wish to achieve in their space relations with China, and then the US should let the Japanese take the lead in negotiating the whole package of cooperative agreements. Japan has a far greater stake in the peace and security of Northeast Asia than the US. Likewise, China’s pollution problems have a greater direct and lasting impact on Japan’s environment and quality of life than on the US. Japan is beginning to make a real contribution to its own national security and, in doing so, is showing itself to be a mature, and fairly reliable, partner to the US. </span><span class="underline">There is now no reason why Japan cannot take the leading role in these kinds of negotiations, which involve difficult military technological and economic problems. Japan has been a reliable, and low maintenance, partner in the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> International Space Station (</span><span class="underline">ISS) program</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. They have delivered their Kibo module to Kennedy Space Center for eventual assembly to the ISS. </span><span class="underline">JAXA</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Japan’s space agency, </span><span class="underline">is struggling to define itself and to adapt to its new roles. If it were to become the main go-between and negotiator for the US, and possibly for other US allies, it would gain both visibility and stature with the Japanese government.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Japanese space program could grow into a major national asset instead of being a minor center for technology development and scientific research. </span><span class="underline"> The US could work with Japan to figure out the long-term technological and military implications of each part of the China-US-Japan relationship. Japan would find that, as America took its commercial and security interests into account, it would be easier for them to reciprocate</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These talks would also fit nicely with Japan’s preference for quiet, and lengthy, negotiations. If the US and China are to find a way to cooperate in space, neither the US nor China should be expected to sacrifice their national interests. Both nations have a stake in the security and prosperity of Japan, which is, after all, the main economic locomotive of the region. </span><span class="underline">It is, therefore, logical to expect Japan to take the lead in bringing the US and China together to work on major international space projects</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span>


International cooperation on manned space flight is key to its success and needs to include China. 
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kamimiori and Diekerman et al.10</span></span> (<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Norimitsu Kamimori, head of the Washington office of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) explained the constrained funding for his civil space agency, pointing out that some plans, like future robotic lunar exploration, have been put on hold. And while Japan would like to cooperate more with the United States on earth science missions, funding shortfalls make that difficult. Andreas Diekmann, Juergen Drescher, and Emmanuel di Lipkowski, the Washington representatives of the European Space Agency (ESA), Germany's space agency, DLR, and France's space agency, CNES, respectively, sounded a similar theme about the outlook for funding for their space activities. They are hopeful that the European Union (EU) will provide more funding for space activities now that it has an official role in space policy thanks to the Lisbon Treaty, which went into force in December 2009. They believe that space programs will benefit f rom t higher-level political attention accorded to EU activitieshttp://www.spacepolicyonline.com/pages/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1174:global-economic-woes-mean-more-international-space-cooperation-should-include-china-say-international-space-reps&catid=91:news&Itemid=84 </span></span>
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="underline">Representatives of Japanese and European space agencies told a Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) audience yesterday about the difficult economic conditions facing their space programs, like that here in the United States, and how international cooperation is key to moving forward -- and China should be part of it. International cooperation will be essential to realizing future plans, they said, especially in human exploration</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Mr. di Lipkowski said that "</span><span class="underline">None of us question the need for American leadership in space</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">." In response to a question about China's role in future international space activities, all four endorsed the idea. Mr. Kamimori pointed out that </span><span class="underline">China is Japan's neighbor and they already have established a cooperative relationship</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially through the Asia Pacific Regional Space Agency Forum (APRSAF), created in 1993 after the 1992 International Space Year. Mr. Diekmann added that ESA has had cooperative programs with China in space science and that China participates in the International Space Exploration Coordination (ISEC) working group of countries discussing future human space exploration. Mr. Drescher said that NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden's ongoing trip to China is an "important cornerstone to keep stability and understand where we are." Mr. di Lipkowski added that China, with its population and economy, cannot be ignored and "we have to bring them into the tent to see how we do things." As to whether ISS is a good model for future international space projects, Mr. di Lipkowski noted that the ISS cooperative framework was developed during the Cold War and a new model will be needed for the current era of international relationships. </span><span class="underline">Offering an impassioned defense of human spaceflight activities, he stressed that "We are living in terrible economic times. We can't do what Apollo did. My message is that we have to cooperate." </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Ruing the fact that younger people today are not very interested in space activities even though it is one of the few sources of "positive" news, he emphasized that what is needed is new governance and export control models and a vision "or we will go nowhere." "We have to sell us, the space community, to the political community and not think that everything we do is marvelous and brilliant." He added that people need to understand that space is not expensive in the overall scheme of things, that in the United States, for example, NASA is only 0.6 percent of the federal budget. Mr. Diekmann said that space applications are the top priority in Europe exactly because the benefits are more visible to the public. </span><span class="underline">Closer collaboration with the United States on new space transportation systems was another theme</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. "That doesn't mean we have to build a common launcher," Mr. Diekmann said, "but we need common interfaces for a more intelligent combination of capabilities," that is, a "common space transportation policy." </span></span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">4 International Cooperation In this section Arianespace is briefly introduced representing a typical international space organization. The main advantages, disadvantages and cultural business challenges caused by an international cooperation are pointed out. 4.1 Example: Arianespace Commercial competition subsidized by governments has become an important part of space transportation competition. Europe, Russia, USA, China, Japan, India, etc. compete for the international space 7 launch market. Each government has developed its own mechanisms for assisting its launch fins. For example, Arianespace is owned by 35 companies, 13 banks and the French space agency CNES (Arianespace, 2005). The percentage distribution of Arianespace’s shareholders in each country is shown in Figure 6. Although it operates as a private firm, Arianespace receives considerable indirect support from the European Space Agency, which has developed the various Ariane launchers, built the launch complexes, and purchases launch services. Figure 6: Arianespace’s Shareholder Distribution in % (Arianespace) 4.2 Advantages • Synergy effect</span><span class="underline">: To achieve much more in a space program than a country can afford to attempt on its own for a given budget. It includes </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">man power </span><span class="underline">(experts from different countries</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">), know-how (</span><span class="underline">high technology</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">) and use of existing infrastructures (</span><span class="underline">spaceport, production facilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, etc.). • </span><span class="underline">Social benefit: In terms that it does broaden the mind and give people a planetary conscience </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(humankind is sitting in the same boat if e.g. a killer asteroid hits Earth). • </span><span class="underline">Realization: Because this might be the only way in near-term to put the vision into action. 4.3 Disadvantages </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">• Share pride with other nations: Because development of space transportation systems is a national achievement that signals a nation’s status as a space power, able to develop and use advanced technology, which is best reflected by an U.S. statement (Longsdon, 1989): “The space program is a visible symbol of U.S. world leadership; its challenges and accomplishments motivate scientific and technical excellence among U.S. students; and it provides for a diverse American population a sense of common national accomplishment and shared pride in American achievement.” 8 • Share technology leadership: Is problematic because most launch technology has direct military applications and much of the technology has been classified or is sensitive. • Tendency of parallel contractors: For an international cooperation, as well as for any other national program, it is necessary to have a clear-cut prime contractor / subcontractor relationship with well defined responsibilities. The lack of a strong prime contractor increase cost and probability for program failure. Cost growth is caused by more manpower, more interfaces, planned and unplanned parallel activities, schedule delays, etc. For example cost increase by 15 % if there are two parallel contractors instead of one, by 25 % for three parallel contractors, by 32 % for four parallel contractors, by 38 % for five parallel contractors and so on (Koelle, D.E., 2003). Due to political or prestige reason, this cost penalty is often accepted. 4</span><span class="underline">.4 Cultural Business Challenges </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In particular for an international cooperation there is a cultural business challenge beside the technical one. Management practices and effectiveness depend on cultural variables such as attitudes, beliefs, value systems, need hierarchies, etc, which are the result of different environmental factors in different countries. In the following are given some examples for behavior based on different environmental factors. The challenge (which may also be transformed to a positive synergy) for managers and workers arises when these different environmental factors collide. North American, European and Asian business cultures are only observed because this includes the leading countries in space technology and political power. • </span><span class="underline">Management</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: Employees in high power distance cultures like Japan and China expect managers to lead and are less comfortable with the delegation of discretionary decisions than those from low power distance cultures such as USA. In addition, American or European managers take personal responsibility for their decisions (Ireland, 1991). </span><span class="underline">• Decision-making:</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Western companies’ decision-making is an individual process, while in Japanese companies it is a group process. Since many people are involved in the process and various meetings are held, there is a greater participation resulting in an easier and more efficient implementation. However, often too many meetings are held with many unnecessary questions and suggestions raised. These may significantly delay business decisions, which often require a swift response. • </span><span class="underline">Family business</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: In the Chinese family business system, subordinates are supposed to think what the boss is thinking and tailor their ideas accordingly. Dissenting opinions and proposals are conveyed to the boss through personal channels with a duly respectful tone (Chen, 2004). But also 9 in Western companies, this process for decision-making is often the case instead of objective assessment of cost and benefits for the company. • Success: While Americans see success as contingent upon their own individual efforts, a promotion in Japan as a reward for hard work may be detrimental to the employee’s performance, as the highly cherished harmony between the promoted person and colleagues may be disturbed. Summarized, to be successful can be assumed to have the same meaning for the Asian and Western world but different for individuals of these two regions: While in the Western world success is mostly projected to the person itself, success within Asia is more related to the organization of the individual. • Alternatives: As for constructing alternatives, future-orientated cultures (typically Western cultures) tend to create more new options, whereas past-oriented cultures (typically Asian cultures) often search for a historical precedent. • Guanxi• Motivation: In terms of motivation, Japanese and Korean employees seem to put more emphasis on extrinsic factors such as job security, work conditions and wages than on intrinsic factors like creativity and achievement. Japanese and Koreans are good at informal communication, but tend to be reluctant in expressing their views openly on formal occasions, especially when their opinions conflict with those of their superiors or colleagues. They are reluctant to convey bad news in a direct manner and carefully avoid open interpersonal conflicts. In addition, they pay careful attention to develop informal channels for communication (Chen, 2004). For an international cooperation, this may cause conflicts, because in order to avoid openly disagreement, Japanese tend to avoid discussions with the result that schedule will be delayed. Conclusion </span><span class="underline">If the total costs for a manned Moon and Mars space transportation system or mission exceed a certain amount, an international cooperation may be the only alternative</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">An international cooperation has the advantage of sharing the total program costs</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In practice, total costs in the case for an international program is higher compared to total costs in the case for a national program. This is caused by more manpower, more interfaces, planned and unplanned parallel activities, schedule delays, etc. </span><span class="underline">In conclusion, even if an international Moon/Mars program is a challenging task, maybe this is the only way to put the vision of humans on Mars into action. </span>


Mars exploration is key to all impacts-including getting off the rock and value to life.

<span class="underline">Why should humans go to Mars</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Many reasons for and against have been cited over the years, and many still struggle to see the relevance of this priority. It seems so far out, so detached from life on Earth, and in many ways it is. Mars is physically hundreds of millions of kilometers away. It is colder than the coldest environment on Earth and it has an atmosphere—or lack thereof—that would kill you within thirty seconds or do in a most unpleasant fashion. Compared to terrestrial destinations it loses hands down. However, we need to look at Mars in a different context. But in the end, why are we even considering such a journey? In a word: life. We don’t yet fully understand all the effects of microgravity but we do know that untreated or lacking countermeasures it can have serious health effects. We don’t know how much gravity is needed to avoid those problems: it’s possible the Moon’s gravity, one-sixth that of Earth, may be sufficient, but certainly Martian gravity, at one-third of Earth’s, should be no worse and may be much better. </span><span class="underline">Mars also has readily available resources, including the most important: water, in relatively abundant amounts, compared to the Moon. Mars also has a roughly 24-hour day night cycle which is crucial for plant development. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But in the end, why are we even considering such a journey? In a word: life. </span><span class="underline">We want to go there to see if we can find evidence of life, a second genesis, and if we don’t find it, we want to establish new life on Mars—our own. Some say that the problems of Earth should be dealt with first, that we are too immature as a species and should wait a while until we “grow up”, but here is the thing: for the first time in history a species on Earth has the knowledge and technology to ensure its own survival by seeding life on new worlds. To ignore this opportunity for some philosophical nirvana to come first could be considered as irresponsible as our environmental abuses also. If there is a planetary crisis, such as the asteroid impact 65 million years ago that wiped out the dinosaurs, and we do nothing, then we will have lost it all. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This is the broad-brush view of why we need to go to Mars, but on a more personal level, what drives people to want to go to such places, so far away, so hostile to life? For many enthusiasts it is an escape, a chance for a new start and the challenge of a lifetime. The reasons for going will be different depending on whom you talk to. They are the same reasons people on Earth moved to hostile and far away environments here. We need to “sharpen up”, so let’s do something worthy of the effort, and something with the payoff equal to the effort put in. </span><span class="underline">The difference is Mars is a whole other planet, not just a distant land. It can be seen as a challenge—an extreme challenge—and it is, so why go? It will test our knowledge, our resourcefulness, and the limits of our abilities in every way. It will be risky, and yes, people will die. But in today’s risk-averse world, the value of a challenge has been grossly underestimated. As people become more and more “stay at home” and turn to ever more push-button solutions, we are losing our survival instinct. Existing and living to simply relax at home where it is safe is not good for any of us in the end. Take the obesity epidemic an example: people are piling on the pounds, sitting around in front of the TV, and literally shortening their life spans while they do this</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Exercise is the key to health and growth for bodies and minds, and this also applies to our society. </span><span class="underline">Expansion to new frontiers should be seen as extremely valuable to us now. In a world that is struggling with political solutions to big problems like the environment, hunger, poverty, and disease, we need a challenge like Mars now more than ever. We need to “sharpen up”,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> so let’s do something worthy of the effort, and something with the payoff equal to the effort put in. </span><span class="underline">Mars, however we get there—be it a direct path or via the Moon, and with government programs or through private commercial space development—should be in our sights, for it has the potential to change our world in ways that we dearly need now. </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span><span class="underline">. The NCND policy has been used widely to allow nuclear weapons to be taken covertly into ports, airspaces, and other areas from which they are in principle excluded. This practice is continuing. 2. Many of these actions are carried out in collusion with the governments of a number of countries whose declaratory policies prohibit the entry of nuclear weapons into their ports, airspace, or other areas</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To achieve this, two analyses are presented. The first is a detailed analysis of records of visits to ports in a number of countries by naval ships capable of carrying nuclear weapons, nuclear capable ships, and by nuclear powered naval ships. This type of information has been used previously as a basis for criticism of NCND,3,5 but new analyses are presented here. The movements of individual nuclear capable ships are followed in detail as they visit neighbouring countries. Countries in the Scandinavian region including Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and in the Pacific including Japan and New Zealand have been selected because of the policy implications of such visits for the countries named. All these countries claim that their ports are always free of nuclear weapons, in peacetime at least. From the records it is argued that if these claims hold good, the ships involved would have been required to be free of nuclear weapons for periods that are so long as to make the strategic value of having had the ships at sea very obscure. Other aspects of these ship visit records will also be presented that support the basic assertions made regarding the use of the NCND policy. A closely related analysis considers the significance of the great sensitivity shown by the United States and the United Kingdom to any suggestion of a challenge to NCND. Details of events since 1984 relating to New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy, events surrounding the 1988 election in Denmark, and the effects of the stand taken to ban nuclear weapons by the port of Kobe in Japan are examined. This analysis shows how an understanding of these events 2 follows readily if the above assertions are correct. </span><span class="underline">A number of nuclear weapons accidents that have revealed, or strongly suggested, deceit in the use of NCND in isolated instances are next described. This evidence, it is claimed, establishes the covert use of NCND beyond reasonable doubt</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Nevertheless, many Western countries with otherwise non-nuclear policies, or that claim to reject nuclear weapons and support nuclear disarmament, have allowed nuclear capable ship visits under NCND for long periods. This could reflect general support for what is argued here to be an extremely undesirable policy, or there could be other reasons for these countries allowing the ship visits. An analysis supporting the latter conclusion is presented which, further, is intended to achieve the second goal of this study. This is to expose what is claimed to be the real answer to the question of why countries have an NCND policy. Although, they would never admit it openly, </span><span class="underline">the nuclear powers use NCND to implement naval and other strategies unhindered by the awkward non-nuclear policies of various countries, including some of their allies.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Its use avoids any need to make public the presence of nuclear weapons in countries, allied or otherwise, where this could cause serious unrest and possibly hinder the continued introduction of these weapons. This is the prime reason for maintaining the policy. </span>

<span style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span class="underline">Major ports are almost always located in or near major population centres, imposing an unacceptable risk to citizens and potential for major economic and social dislocation in the event of a radiation emergency. Levels of environmental contamination will depend on the amount and types of radioactive isotopes released. As our historical examples show, these factors will be determined by unpredictable circumstances. Potential exists for immediate and long-term environmental and human health detriments, with contamination by isotopes such as iodine-131 and caesium-137, which move readily into the environment, affecting multiple levels of the food chain. A reactor leak occurring in Australian waters could lead to serious radioactive pollution of marine and coastal habitats. </span></span>

<span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">We have described a tractable model of plutonium dispersal in the event of a nuclear weapon accident in which the HE in the weapon detonates</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">. This was followed by a quantitative discussion of the health hazard posed by inhaled plutonium in terms of potential cancer deaths. We then applied these results to hypothetical accidents of this type in India or Pakistan to get an estimate of nearly 5000 cancer fatalities caused in a worst case scenario of this type. To this human cost has to be added the massive financial cost of even limited decontamination of just the immediate neighbourhood of the accident, which could be at least hundreds of crores of rupees (see Chenin and Murfin12). This would clearly be a major catastrophe. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">Should such a category 3 plutonium dispersal accident take place in South Asia, we believe our estimates of damage are quite conservative</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">. We are well aware that the phenomenon of plutonium dispersal and its health hazards are exceedingly complex and that there is considerable variation in the models and parameters used to characterize its different facets. Nevertheless, given the gravity of the problem, one cannot shirk from obtaining at least an order of magnitude estimate of the overall damage. To be useful, this should be done in a manner that is transparent, in both its assumptions and its methodology. This permits any scientific disagreement about the conclusions to focus on individual contributory factors. In this spirit, we have used the wedge model since it captures the essential physics of plutonium dispersal in simple analytical fashion. It is easy to apply to different situations and the dependence of its results on different contributing factors is easy to pinpoint. While the simplicity of the model means that it cannot reliably give detailed distributions of plutonium contamination, especially in the high-dosage region near the accident site, it is known to give results in agreement with those from more detailed models and numerical codes at larger distances. In the no-threshold linear model of radiationinduced cancer risk, which is generally accepted, it is the low-dosage contamination over large areas that contributes most to cancer fatalities. If, however, there turns out to be a threshold radiation dose below which radiation-induced cancer risk vanishes, then the number of fatalities would be reduced. But, in the absence of concrete evidence for a threshold, caution demands that, like BEIR and ICRP, public health risk estimates be made using a no-threshold model. The wedge model offers a good technique for making an order of magnitude estimate of the total number of cancer fatalities from such accidents. Even within the wedge model some of the input parameters like the aerosol deposition speed v, the mixing layer height H and the wedge angle q can have widely varying values. The biological factors that determine the cancer risks of plutonium inhalation also vary in the literature, depending on the basic data used to arrive at them. We have taken care to point out in this article the range of likely GENERAL ARTICLES CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 80, NO. 10, 25 MAY 2001 1283 values of all these different parameters, and used conservative values. Admittedly, if in a given incident all the parameters conspire to take extreme values, they can upset even order of magnitude estimates. Notice, however, that the crucial formula (eq. (7)) for mass of inhaled plutonium in the uniform population density case, which we have used for our worst case estimate, is independent of most of the uncertain parameters. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">It may be argued that this worst case estimate of 5000 (or perhaps as many as four times more) predicted cancer deaths could take a few decades to occur and that it will form only a small fraction of all cancer fatalities during that period due to other causes</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">. There is limited reliable data on cancer mortality in South Asia30. One estimate in 1985 reported a crude cancer mortality rate of about 54 per 100,000 in South Asia31. Total cancer incidence in India for the year 1990 was estimated to be 612,300, while cancer mortality was estimated to be 4,33,000 (ref. 32). But 5000 deaths are still 5000 deaths. That they happen quietly over decades among a largely unsuspecting public does not mitigate the tragedy. If it can be avoided, it must be. Finally </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">let us reiterate that our estimate of casualties is not for a nuclear explosion, but only for plutonium dispersal and inhalation from the detonation of the HE in a weapon.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;"> The possibility of detonation of the HE triggering in turn the detonation of the nuclear weapon cannot be ruled out: the 4th category in our list of possible accidents. </span>


Sub deterrence doesn’t work
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sharp 9</span></span> (Travis, Research Associate at the Center for A New American Security, “Triad Talk: Submarine Forensics,” Center for arms Control and Nonproliferation, October 7, [[@http://www.nukesofhazardblog.com/story/2009/10/7/174650/576]])
<span class="underline">As the Obama administration pursues nuclear weapons reductions, analysts are revisiting proposals to modify, or even eliminate, parts of the U.S. strategic triad of land-based missiles, submarines, and bombers. Triad talk has trickled into both the specialty press and provincially-interested local newspapers. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Conventional wisdom holds that nuclear-capable submarines are the crème de la crème of deterrence. Because they are invulnerable to an enemy first strike, submarines offer a guaranteed retaliatory capability that leaders would not feel pressured to “use or lose” in a crisis situation. Reflecting conventional wisdom, a senior Pentagon official said last week that submarines "are and have been the centerpiece, the core, of our deterrent…It's likely that they'll remain that. Whatever we do with nuclear weapons, we ought to get that right." </span><span class="underline">Though few have questioned the overall merit of ballistic missile submarines, concern has been expressed before about the risks involved in placing such a large proportion of U.S. nuclear forces aboard relatively few delivery vehicles. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> During the Cold War, it was feared that the Soviet Union might produce a technological breakthrough that would allow it to detect American submarines. The Heritage Foundation warned that the Soviets were working on non-acoustic space-based detection that would allow them to “scan large swaths of ocean space.” Such warnings often were issued, not surprisingly, in support of investing in new ICBMs or bombers as an alternative to submarines. Though this and lesser detection technologies didn’t pan out, the implications were clear even to arms controllers. As Herbert Scoville Jr. wrote in 1982, “The fewer submarines kept at sea, the easier it will be for the Russians to wipe them out in a surprise attack.” Concern has petered out since the end of the Cold War, but it hasn’t disappeared entirely. In an October 2008 letter to the Strategic Posture Commission, the Senate ICBM Coalition wrote that “a nuclear force without ICBMs could be drastically depleted with very limited attacks on just a handful of aimpoints, thereby creating a condition under which an adversary may be more willing to assume the risks associated with aggression.” Again, note the motivation of the doubters (aka ICBM partisans). The idea that an adversary could simultaneously attack and destroy all 12 patrolling Ohio-class submarines, and thus neutralize the U.S. sea-based deterrent, strikes me as so remote that it is not worth losing any sleep over. In the name of prudence, we ought to mitigate the risk by exercising extreme caution when submarines are at their most vulnerable (entering or exiting operating bases) and by developing (and monitoring other countries’ development of) detection technologies and related countermeasures. These vulnerabilities and safety measures, however, do not detract from the conclusion that submarines are still the most survivable and stable leg of the U.S. strategic triad. </span>


We have the only risk of nuclear war-international norms dictate no country will ever willingly enter conflict.

<span class="underline">It is widely acknowledged today among nuclear policy analysts and public officials that a "nuclear taboo" exists at the global level. The taboo is associated with wide- spread popular revulsion against nuclear weapons and widely held inhibitions on their use</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Prominent analysts and theorists of deterrence, such as George Quester, Thomas Schelling, and Bruce Russett, have noted this phenomenon and suggest that it has played a role in explaining non-use.8 As Schelling first noted thirty years ago, the special status of nuclear weapons is something we have come to take for granted today.9 </span><span class="underline">No one today thinks nuclear weapons are "just another weapon."</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Whereas once countries such as Sweden, Switzerland, and Australia assumed they would ac- quire nuclear weapons as simply the latest in modern weapons technology, few think this way today.10 </span><span class="underline">By global level I refer to the collective level of the international community. The taboo is a systemic phenomenon. The shift in international attitudes toward nuclear weapons from 1945 to the present is well documented based on global public opin- 7.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Questions of origins and effects of norms can indeed be separated, since the functioning of a norm may differ from historical explanations for its rise. For example, the rise of the taboo historically has not been a simple function of the interests of the nuclear powers. Indeed, one of the most interesting features of its development is that it has been driven significantly by domestic and international grassroots peace and antinuclear movements, and the norm has developed despite consistent and long-standing official U.S. resistance to it. Ultimately, a nuclear non-use norm is in the greatest interest of small, non-nuclear states, since they have no recourse against nuclear attack other than the restraint induced by the norm. The nuclear powers, in principle, can always rely on deterrence for their security. See Tannenwald, in process. 8. See Quester 1991; Schelling 1994; and Russett 1989.

The decreasing legitimacy of nuclear weapons is not simply reflected in public opinion but has become institutionalized in an array of international agreements and regimes, both multilateral and bilateral, which together circumscribe the realm of legitimate nuclear use and restrict freedom of action with respect to nuclear weapons. </span><span class="underline">These include nuclear weapons free zones, arms control agreements, "negative security assurances," and the general laws of armed con- flict</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 11 Although there is no explicit legal prohibition outlawing nuclear weapons use, and its legality remains in dispute, the trend line of decreasing legitimacy and circum- scribed legality is clear. 12 Together, </span><span class="underline">these agreements enhance the normative presump- tion against nuclear use</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and, </span><span class="underline">by multiplying the fora where a decision to use nuclear weapons would have to be defended, substantially increase the burden of proof for any such decision</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.13 The nuclear taboo refers to a de facto prohibition against the use of nuclear weap- ons. The taboo is not the behavior (of non-use) itself, but rather the normative belief about the behavior. In this article, I refer to both norms and taboos. By norm I mean a shared expectation about behavior, a standard of right or wrong. Norms are prescrip- tions or proscriptions for behavior. </span><span class="underline">A taboo is a particularly forceful kind of norma- tive prohibition that, according to the anthropological and sociological literature, deals with "the sociology of danger."</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 14 It is concerned with the protection of indi- viduals and societies from behavior defined or perceived to be dangerous and typi- cally refers to something that is not done, said, or touched. I use the term taboo because it has often been used by political and military leaders themselves to refer to this normative phenomenon. However, a caveat is in order. The word taboo is generally associated with a stronger and more developed normative prohibition than the word norm and connotes such qualities as absoluteness, unthink- ingness, and taken-for-grantedness. It also involves expectations of awful conse- quences or sanctions to follow in the wake of a taboo violation. In its early days, the norm of nuclear non-use was clearly not a taboo in these senses, even though some decision makers referred to it as such. It has taken on more "taboo"-like qualities as it has developed over time. The fact that the word taboo is used, however, sheds important light on how its users perceive the world. 11. For example, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT, 1968); the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (1996); treaties that create nuclear weapons-free zones in Latin America, Africa, the South Pacific, on the moon, and the seabed; and U.S.-Soviet/Russian nuclear arms control agreements. Fujita 1988. "Negative security assurances" are declarations by the nuclear powers that they will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states party to the NPT. Bunn 1997. 12 In a 1996 advisory opinion, the World Court found that the use or threat of nuclear weapons is "generally" unlawful but said it could not "definitively" conclude whether it would be unlawful in ex- treme circumstances of self-defense if the survival of the state were at stake.

Nuclear Taboo 437 </span><span class="underline">Three Normative Effects I analyze the role of the taboo in terms of three kinds of normative effects: regulative (or constraining), constitutive, and a subset of constitutive effects I call "permis- sive."</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is commonly noted that there are different kinds of norms and rules.15 How- ever, since any given norm can operate in different ways, and may have multiple effects, it is analytically useful to think in terms of different kinds of effects of norms. </span><span class="underline">Regulative effects, emphasized by rationalist approaches to international relations, refer to how norms constrain or "regulate antecedently existing activities." 16 In con- trast, constitutive effects, emphasized by constructivist perspectives, refer to how rules and norms, through actor practices, create or define forms of behavior, roles, and identities.17 The primary regulative effect of the taboo is the injunction against using nuclear weapons first. It constrains a behavior (nuclear use) that would exist whether or not there were any rules about it.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But the taboo also exhibits several constitutive effects: on the categories actors use to understand weapons and on the identity of a "civi- lized" state. Categories provide important boundaries with implications for both be- havior and identity. The taboo helps to define a category of unacceptable "weapons of mass destruction," distinguished from unproblematic "conventional" weapons that are, in contrast, viewed as legitimate and usable. The taboo has also become part of a broader discourse-a set of practices-of the society of states defining what it means to be a "civilized" member of the international community. One of the require- ments for being a "civilized" state is participation in the regulation of warfare-a practice that began among European states during the nineteenth century.18 The nuclear taboo has become part of the contemporary discourse of "civilization," itself a much more deeply embedded or highly "taken-for-granted" norm than the nuclear taboo. It is evoked in such phrases as were used in the Persian Gulf War to demonize Saddam Hussein: "only a barbarian would use nuclear weapons." Finally, </span><span class="underline">permissive effects-a subset of constitutive effects-are secondary, indi- rect, or "shadow" effects, often unintended consequences of the operation of a norm. By this notion I refer to the way norms-particularly taboos-by serving as focal points, selectively divert our normative gaze.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> By defining categories of weapons in certain ways, such as "weapons of mass destruction," and drawing our attention to associated normative injunctions, they may obscure other "facts" about the world and shield other practices from attention. Thus one effect of the nuclear taboo, for example, may be to shield non-nuclear weapons from normative opprobrium.</span>


<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Detterrence fails and is empirically disproven-weapons aren’t used because they are taboo. </span></span>

<span class="underline">We have recently witnessed the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only use of nuclear weapons in warfare. The non-use of nuclear weap- ons since then remains the single most important phenomenon of the nuclear age</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Yet we still lack a full understanding of how this tradition arose and is maintained and of its prospects for the future. </span><span class="underline">The widely cited explanation is deterrence, but this ac- count is either wrong or incomplete. Although an element of sheer luck no doubt has played a part in this fortuitous outcome, this article argues that a normative element must be taken into account in explaining why nuclear weapons have not been used since 1945. A normative prohibition on nuclear use has developed in the global system, which, although not (yet) a fully robust norm, has stigmatized nuclear weap- ons as unacceptable weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of mass destruction. Without this normative stigma, there might have been more "use."' This article examines this phenomenon in the context of the nuclear experience of the United States. This investigation is motivated by several empirical anomalies in the conventional account-deterrence-of the non-use of nuclear weapons since 1945. </span><span class="underline">First is the non-use of nuclear weapons in cases where there was no fear of nuclear retaliation, that is, where the adversary could not retaliate in kind. This anomaly includes the first ten years or so of the nuclear era,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> when the United States possessed first an absolute nuclear monopoly and then an overwhelming nuclear advantage over the Soviet Union. </span><span class="underline">It also includes non-use by the United States in Vietnam (where the United States dropped tonnage equivalent to dozens of Hiroshima bombs) and in the 1991 Persian</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For helpful comments and criticisms on presentations of this article, I am grateful to participants in seminars at Brown University, Harvard University, Yale University, Stanford University, and the Univer- sity of California, Irvine.

By "use" I mean dropping or launching nuclear weapons in all circumstances other than testing. States have obviously relied on nuclear weapons in other ways, including for deterrence, making threats, and alliance relations. Intemnational Organization 53, 3, Summer 1999, pp. 433-468 ? 1999 by The 10 Foundation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 434 International Organization Gulf War. </span><span class="underline">Fear of retaliation also does not account for why Britain did not use nuclear weapons in the Falklands, nor for why the Soviet Union did not resort to nuclear weapons to avoid defeat in Afghanistan. A second anomaly emerges when we turn the question around and ask why nuclear weapons, supposedly fearsome deterrent weapons, have not deterred attacks by non- nuclear states against nuclear states. China attacked U.S. forces in the Korean War, North Vietnam attacked U.S. forces in the Vietnam War, Argentina attacked Britain in the Falklands in 1982, and Iraq attacked U.S. forces and Israel in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Knowledge of a widespread normative opprobrium against nuclear use may have strengthened expectations of non-nuclear states that nuclear weapons would not be used against them. A third anomaly is that, as Harald Muller has pointed out, the security situation of small, non-nuclear states has not been rendered as perilous in the nuclear age as a realist picture of a predatory anarchy would predict, even though they are completely defenseless against nuclear attack and could not retaliate in kind.2 Most non-nuclear states do not live daily in a nuclear security dilemma. Fi- nally, </span><span class="underline">if deterrence is all that matters, then why have so many states not developed nuclear weapons when they could have done so? Realist arguments that U.S. security guarantees extend the U.S. nuclear umbrella to these non-nuclear states are inad- equate, since some of these non-nuclear (but nuclear-capable) states lack U.S. guar- antees.3 I argue that these patterns cannot be accounted for without taking into account the development of a normative prohibition against nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">This norm is essen- tial to explaining why nuclear weapons have remained unused and to accounting for their special status as "taboo" weapons.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4 Its effect has been to delegitimize nuclear weapons as weapons of war and to embed deterrence practices in a set of norms (regulatory and constitutive) that stabilize and restrain the self-help behavior of states. The larger issue is how conventions (norms, taboos) affect military capabilities and thus the practice of self-help in the international system.5</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">THE TIME HAS COME. The neither confirm nor deny policy has been examined in considerable detail. The official bases for maintaining the policy have been discussed and rejected. </span><span class="underline">A much more unacceptable basis for the high value that is at present placed on the policy by some countries has been suggested, and evidence for its validity has been presented. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Grave problems that the policy raises have been exposed, and benefits that abandoning it would yield described. Mechanisms whereby the policy could be abandoned without serious loss of the values that certain countries now attach to it have been proposed, along with ways in which reluctance to abandon the policy could be overcome. Growing demands for naval arms control and disarmament have been referred to. </span><span class="underline">There are also increasing calls for naval arms to be considered as an integral part of an overall military balance rather than seeking an independent naval balance or parity83 The Disarmament Commission of the United Nations in its ` </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">May 1989 meeting referred for the first time to the NCND principle in its reporting documentation reflecting the suggestion: by several, delegations that the current practice of nuclear weapon States of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons onboard any particular ship at any particular time should be abandoned.149 </span><span class="underline">Many suggestions of confidence building measures for naval forces and activities are appearing now, The United States and Russia established nuclear risk reduction centres in 1988 to increase communicati</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">on, avoid accidental nuclear war and terrorist attacks using nuclear weapons, and signed the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities, designed to help prevent the use of-force in responding to unintentional military incidents.150 Two recent media reports headed US-Soviet Warmth Melts the Cold War and Russians Scratched From the Arms Race(151) spell out clearly the amazing changes'' in superpower relations that are occurring, and the accompanying change in emphasis from military superiority to reductions in military spending that are emerging. (152) The Malta summit late in 1989 again showed the warming in East-West relations that is the mark of these times. President Bush declared: We stand at the threshold of a brand new era of US-Soviet relations. and President Gorbachev responded: The world leaves one epoch of Cold War, and enters another epoch. This is just the beginning of a long road to a long-lasting peaceful period.153 Also at Malta, President Gorbachev is reported to have formally proposed the abolition of all naval tactical nuclear weapons. The proposal would have restricted nuclear weapons at sea to strategic missile submarines. It was rejected out of hand by President Bush, who also refused to include the US Navy in conventional arms control agreements.159 At sea meanwhile there are ballistic missile submarines deployed on which the commanders enjoy a level of autonomy regarding the control of their nuclear weapons not equalled anywhere.98 Soviet submarines are deployed that are seen by experts in the West as a greater danger to their crews than to anyone else.155 Recent Soviet submarine accidents like those discussed under violations support this view. Reports have been appearing for some time that indicate the serious unreliability of some naval and air borne weapons including cruise missiles, and new missiles like Trident 2 and the MX missile have failed in tests.156 The NCND policy is intimately involved in the deployment of, or planned deployment of, these weapons. The contrast between these facts and the rapidly improving situation just discussed is depressing, and must be removed. Eliminating NCND would be a major step in achieving this. 73 The situation in the Asia-Pacific region is also much less encouraging than in Europe. Speaking to a panel of delegates from a Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference meeting in New Zealand late in 1989, the Head of the North East Asia Project at the Australian National University, Professor S Harris suggested the outside perception was that: the United States response to Soviet European developments was far more positive than to Soviet Pacific developments. </span><span class="underline">It also appeared that the United States wanted the rest of the world to adjust to its perception but was at the same time slow to respond internationally to a changing world. he said. A report of this meeting states: that it was quite clear from comments by various speakers that the United States is seen as an increasingly destabilising influence as it fails to keep up with change (in the Asia-Pacific region).</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But a United States representative, Mr P Rosenblatt, former White House official and Ambassador to Micronesia, said that: emphasis on economic expenditure as opposed to military expenditure raised the spectre of a destabilising effect in the region, particularly if Mikhail Gorbachev's words did not translate into action.157 The superpower military presence in the region is shown clearly in the Pacific by the presence of large naval and air forces. </span><span class="underline">Reductions in these forces analogous to reductions underway or proposed in Europe, and the associated easing of the present tensions reflected in the feelings just quoted, would again be asssted greatly by abandoning NCND</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Soviet Union is proposing a meeting of Foreign Ministers from countries in the region to establish a negotiating mechanism for the consideration of all suggestions connected with the region's security, and has suggested further steps to reduce military tensions. These include troop and armament reductions, limits on military exercises, information exchanges, the mutual renunciation of the first use of any weapons, and a tripartite agreement between the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union on preventing incidents in and over the high seas, or between Japan and the USSR to complement the existing US-USSR agreement158 Abandoning NCND would be a very appropriate goal for such negotiations to achieve as a first step to a more secure Pacific. While many of the arguments in this study could fruitfully be extended, it is considered that enough material has been presented to establish the validity of the claim that the neither confirm nor deny policy is oppressive in its working, is obstructive in many important respects, and is obsolete in now lacking any real strategic justification that can outweigh the problems the policy creates. A recent article, Whether to Confirm or Deny?, by Lieutenant N Flacco, US Navy, in which he suggests that 'it may be the right time for the Navy to reconsider its (NCND) policy.' supports many of the arguments presented here.162 </span><span class="underline">NCND is a backward looking policy, a policy of the past, increasingly more out of keeping with changes occurring both This is a time of increasing openness not secrecy, cooperation not confrontation. The time has come for NCND to be abandoned and replaced by measures like those suggested in this study embodied in a policy appropriate to this new era, a policy for the future. </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span><span class="underline">. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The NCND policy has been used widely to allow nuclear weapons to be taken covertly into ports, airspaces, and other areas from which they are in principle excluded. This practice is continuing</span>. 2. Many of these actions are carried out in collusion with the governments of a number of countries whose declaratory policies prohibit the entry of nuclear weapons into their ports, airspace, or other areas</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To achieve this, two analyses are presented. The first is a detailed analysis of records of visits to ports in a number of countries by naval ships capable of carrying nuclear weapons, nuclear capable ships, and by nuclear powered naval ships. This type of information has been used previously as a basis for criticism of NCND,3,5 but new analyses are presented here. The movements of individual nuclear capable ships are followed in detail as they visit neighbouring countries. Countries in the Scandinavian region including Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and in the Pacific including Japan and New Zealand have been selected because of the policy implications of such visits for the countries named. All these countries claim that their ports are always free of nuclear weapons, in peacetime at least. From the records it is argued that if these claims hold good, the ships involved would have been required to be free of nuclear weapons for periods that are so long as to make the strategic value of having had the ships at sea very obscure. Other aspects of these ship visit records will also be presented that support the basic assertions made regarding the use of the NCND policy. A closely related analysis considers the significance of the great sensitivity shown by the United States and the United Kingdom to any suggestion of a challenge to NCND. Details of events since 1984 relating to New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy, events surrounding the 1988 election in Denmark, and the effects of the stand taken to ban nuclear weapons by the port of Kobe in Japan are examined. This analysis shows how an understanding of these events 2 follows readily if the above assertions are correct. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A number of nuclear weapons accidents that have revealed, or strongly suggested, deceit in the use of NCND in isolated instances are next described. This evidence, it is claimed, establishes the covert use of NCND beyond reasonable doubt</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Nevertheless, many Western countries with otherwise non-nuclear policies, or that claim to reject nuclear weapons and support nuclear disarmament, have allowed nuclear capable ship visits under NCND for long periods. This could reflect general support for what is argued here to be an extremely undesirable policy, or there could be other reasons for these countries allowing the ship visits. An analysis supporting the latter conclusion is presented which, further, is intended to achieve the second goal of this study. This is to expose what is claimed to be the real answer to the question of why countries have an NCND policy. Although, they would never admit it openly, </span><span class="underline">the nuclear powers use NCND to implement naval and other strategies unhindered by the awkward non-nuclear policies of various countries, including some of their allies.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Its use avoids any need to make public the presence of nuclear weapons in countries, allied or otherwise, where this could cause serious unrest and possibly hinder the continued introduction of these weapons. This is the prime reason for maintaining the policy. </span>

<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">NCND INCREASES THE DANGERS OF MILITARY EXERCISES AND SPYING AND SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES, AND INCREASES THE RISK OF NUCLEAR WAR</span>. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Military exercises are often provocative and tension producing to some extent. These undesirable features of what many countries consider an essential element in maintaining a well prepared military force, conducting realistic exercises, are exacerbated by any uncertainty regarding the military units and weapons to be involved in a given exercise. An important step was taken towards reducing these problems for military exercises in Europe in the agreements covering exercises reached in 1986 at the Conference on Confidence and Security Building measures and Disarmament in Europe.91 These apply mainly to land based forces, but do involve associated naval forces. They require the signatories to refrain from the threat or use of force and, in the case of large scale exercises, to provide prior notification and a considerable amount of technical detail concerning the military units involved, the purpose of the exercise, its timing, and location. Observers are to be allowed at certain exercises, and annual calendars of planned large scale exercises are to be exchanged. This contrasts starkly with the situation for naval exercises where, at least for the United States, secrecy still prevailed at the time of writing. </span><span class="underline">The dangers inherent in naval exercises where no notification, information exchange, or observer provisions exist have been analysed by several authors.92 They also consider similar dangers arising from other activities like spying missions that involve provocative intrusions into another country's territory or adjoining areas, and from the deployment of naval units near sensitive coastal areas of opposing countries. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">These authors describe events, by no means uncommon, which are potentially very dangerous. Collisions between United States and Soviet vessels during naval exercises for example, once even inside Vladivostok harbour.</span> On another occasion, after the United States submarine Gato had collided with a Soviet submarine, the weapons officer prepared to arm a SUBROC nuclear anti-submarine rocket.90 <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">It is clear that uncertainty regarding the nuclear armed status of vessels exercising near one's coast</span>, or likely to be entering one's sea territory or ports covertly, or to be deployed in or near such areas, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">increases tension and is destabilising.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The difference from the European situation is shown by events prior to the United States holding late in 1989 what is widely considered to be the largest naval exercise ever held in the Asia-Pacific region, known as PACEX 89. News 55 of this planned exercise started to emerge unofficially late in 1988, but requests by the author under the Freedom of Information Act for information concerning it were denied on the grounds that such a release 'could jeopardise the successful conduct of planned exercises.' A formal Appeal lodged against this decision was only answered in September 1989 after the exercise had commenced, when a public affairs statement was provided.93 This confirmed an earlier report by Pacific Command spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel T Boyd, that a` total of 80,000 United States military personnel from all four combat services, army, air force, navy, and marines, would take part in various stages of the exercise,94 but details of the exercise were withheld. Forces from several allied countries participated with United States units in the exercise, but no details were released on the number of foreign military personnel involved. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The exercise is understood to have included what must have appeared to be very provocative activities in or close to sensitive Soviet naval and land areas. Many of the American units involved were nuclear capable and very likely, but under NCND not certainly, nuclear armed</span>. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This exercise was viewed by most commentators as extremely undesirable since it appeared aimed at practicing actions of a strategically offensive nature appropriate in an attack situation, rather than defensive manoeuvres. The element of secrecy that was involved only added to the tension and worsening of relations that the exercise might well have created between the United States and the Soviet Union at a time when improving relations need to be nurtured. United States officials claim, however, that the exercise was necessary to maintain skills and is a United States only exercise with other countries performing their own exercises under its umbrella.95 Nevertheless, it has been reported in the press that the exercise was conducted under the leadership of Admiral H Hardisty, Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Command, the first time a Commander in Chief of Pacific Command has led an exercise in peacetime.96 By contrast, the Soviet Union held a much smaller scale naval exercise off Vladivostok in July 1989 and, for the first time as far as is known, released quite detailed advance information concerning the exercise and the forces involved. Most Pacific countries including the United States, 15 countries, were invited to send observers to the exercise, but only Indonesia, Malaya, Vietnam, and India accepted. The invitation was extended to foreign journalists also.97 The exercise appeared to conform with the proclaimed new Soviet naval policy of orienting their naval forces towards coastal defence rather than blue water offensive activities. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">This subject of dangerous incidents associated with military exercises, deployments of naval vessels or units close to sensitive areas, covert activities and the like, and the added danger that NCND creates is a very large one</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For the sake of brevity it will not be explored more fully here. One further and very serious aspect of the subject must, however, be discussed briefy. This is the possibility that the first use of nuclear weapons could take place at sea, and could trigger a nuclear war. Several analysts have examined this possibility.98 In a well known study published in the Winter Issue for 1985/86 of the journal International Security, Dr Desmond Ball, Head of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in the Australian National University, states that </span><span class="underline">there are good reasons for believing that this sequence of events represents a very real threat</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.98 The first reason he gives is that the sea is the only area where nuclear weapons platforms of the United States and the Soviet Union actually come into physical contact as a result of accidents in a variety of circumstances such as those relating to exercises and covert activities already discussed, and in games of chicken in which ships from these two navies attempt to gauge the resolve of each other. This was described in 1976 by American Admiral E Zumwalt as 'an extremely dangerous but exhilarating running game… that American and Soviet ships have been playing with each other for many years.' Harassment for military purposes is also not uncommon Ball says, and in some cases is difficult to distinguish from preparations for hostilities. These are all obviously dangerous circumstances that could lead to actual hostilities arising 56 from reaction to tension, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">tension that is worsened by uncertainty regarding the presence of nuclear weapons.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The United States and the Soviet Union have entered into some agreements to reduce these risks, but disturbing incidents continue to occur.44,98 Ball then cites the attractiveness of ships like aircraft carriers as nuclear targets, the relative autonomy of United States submarine commanders which gives them effectively independent control over the decision to launch nuclear weapons, the dangers of escalation to nuclear weapons in naval conflicts because of the common deployment of dual conventional and nuclear capable weapons systems and platforms, the most recent being the Tomahawk cruise missiles, and the lack of any clear and coherent doctrine in the United States at least for the use of naval nuclear weapons, as sources of great concern. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">He discusses the offensive nature of present United States naval strategy which is to seek out and engage any enemy 'as far forward as possible',</span> which he sees as containing the seeds of extremely rapid escalation. Yet, he says, by comparison with the army and air force, navy doctrine relating to tactical nuclear weapons in which he includes Tomahawk, 'is quite inchoate and incoherent.' <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The dangers inherent in each of these factors in relation to the possibility of nuclear war beginning at sea are seriously aggravated by NCND, and in the case of dual capable weapons and platforms result from it directly</span>. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The contradictions in, and dangers of, the United States Maritime Strategy as it is called, and the impact of naval nuclear weapons on it, have been discussed by other authors.99 While the US Navy claims that this strategy is designed to avoid future conflicts going nuclear, these authors like Ball strongly disagree. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">This leaves the other nations faced with an opponent professing a strategy that is offensive in nature but incoherent</span> regarding the most dangerous weapons it might involve, and with a policy, NCND, that increases the uncertainty surrounding the presence of those very weapons in tense situations. I<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">n an assessment of Soviet doctrine for war at sea Ball concludes that for a number of reasons:</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the Soviet Navy must be expected to resort to the use of nuclear weapons at a fairly early stage in any major engagement at sea. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">NCND can only add to the probability of that occurring</span>. </span>

In this model, the impact of the meltdown is almost entirely mitigated by preservation of the primary (the casing of the core) and secondary (the vessel hull) containment structures.

<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The danger from not having IHE and fire-resistant pits is further amplified by two aspects in the design of Trident missiles</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, themselves. First is the rocket motor design. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Trident-1 uses a rocket fuel which is so touchy the Air Force would not use it in MX,</span> except for the smaller third stage motor which ignites way out in spac</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">e. Trident-2 uses this more volatile propellant to increase its range a mere 100-150 nautical miles. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The other aspect is the manner in which the warheads are clustered around the third-stage motor</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> During the 1972 EXPO task force to configure an extended-range Poseidon missile -- now known as Trident-1 -- a third-stage motor was added. </span><span class="underline">Warheads under the Poseidon nose fairing were arranged ten in an outer circle and four in the center, on the deck of the post-boost control system (PBCS, or “bus”). <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">To find space for this new third-stage motor, the center reentry vehicles were removed.</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A third stage motor was then installed protruding up through the deck on which the warheads are mounted -- right in the middle of the circle of bombs</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">This arrangement then carried over into Trident-2. So now the responsible officials are belatedly worried that placing such touchy propellant in the middle of the warheads raises the ante for an accidental nuclear blast</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Since the Drell Panel released its report, Trident missiles can no longer be handled with their warheads installed. The warheads are mated to the missile after the missile is installed in the submarine. Both the British and US Navies claim this was their procedure anyway. When START-2 is ratified by Russia, only half the previously-planned number of Trident warheads will be deployed by 2003. One way of accomplishing that is to only load four on each missile, instead of eight. If that were the means chosen for reduction, Dr. Ray Kidder suggests using the space left to add blast deflectors and shielding that would protect the four remaining warheads from possible explosion of the third-stage motor.5 If that were done, no missile could carry more than four warheads. And since Britain plans to obtain its missiles from a common pool, the British missiles would also be limited to four warheads each. A bad aspect of this idea is that the planned compliment of missiles will still be required and production could not be stopped. C. THE SAFETY OF BRITAIN'S TRIDENT. In response to public and parliamentary concern over how the Drell findings relate to the British Trident, the Secretary of State for Defence in mid-1991 commissioned MOD's Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor E.R. Oxburgh, to head up a Safety Review Group to "review, in the light of any relevant aspects of the report of the Drell Panel ... the safety of the present and 6HC-337 of Session 1991-92, p. xv. 7The Safety of UK Nuclear Weapons, p. 1. 8The Safety of UK Nuclear Weapons, p. 1. 9The Safety of UK Nuclear Weapons, pp. 4-6. 10The Sun, 6 August 1992, pp. A 1 & A4. 11The Sun, 6 August 1992, p.

<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Trident is not the first to have primary problems -- the original conventional-explosive triggers in Poseidon warheads were so touchy that a jolt of the missile could set them</span> off</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">This new Trident problem is similar</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and also concerns the chemical explosive trigger which then Energy Secretary James D.

<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Another worrisome matter for both the US and Britain is that so much destructive power is put under the control of so few men on a Trident submarine</span>. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In a 1984 letter, the late Congressman Ted Weiss said the Navy's Congressional Liaison Office admitted that a conspiracy of only four men on a Trident submarine could fire the missiles<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A Trident submarine skipper with the cooperation of three other officers -- presumably the executive officer, the weapons officer, and the communications officer -- Could unleash the destructive power of as much as 6,500 Hiroshimas</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

That is scary. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Given 70 days of confined environment in an atmosphere of paranoia and secrecy, it is not hard to construct scenarios where reality can be distorted.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Drell Panel expressed satisfaction with the technical measures and serious consideration regarding control of the use of US Air Force nuclear weapons. But it points out that “the Navy's fleet ballistic missile system differs in that, whereas launch authority comes from outside the submarine, 16Drell Report, p. 34. 17The Day, 4 January 1995, p. A11. Page 7 of PLRC-991208 there is no requirement for external information to be provided in order physically to enable a launch. It is also important to evaluate the suitability of continuing this procedure in the future.”16 In response to the report's criticism, the US Navy "reluctantly agreed" to install electronic devices in Trident submarines that can only be unlocked by shore-based authorities.17 No one on the submarine would know the combination to the safe until it is transmitted to them. How this will really work and how much safer this will be than previous methods is not known. But it will undoubtedly serve its public-relations purpose. Command and control of missiles on a British submarine must be similar, and hardly any more stringent. The danger is certainly no less.</span>

<span class="underline">While submarines’ large warheads-to-vehicles ratio isn’t worth worrying much about, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">another potential risk – attribution – seems much more worthy of consternation, especially because uncertainty about missing submarines has been a problem before. </span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">If one of our submarines was damaged, disabled, or sunk, would the United States be able to attribute the cause properly</span>? In other words, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would we know what, or who, did it? The answer to this question is important because it is obviously nice to know when you are under attack, particularly if that attack might be part of an attempt at a disarming first strike that would render you unable to retaliate.</span> Both the 2001 government report and the ICBM Coalition letter cited above raise the specter of inconclusive attribution as a potential flaw in sea-based deterrence. The 2001 report contrasts submarines’ potential ambiguity with the “large and unambiguous” U.S. ICBM force, whose sheer size and wide dispersion “greatly reduces the potential gain from such a small, ambiguous attack<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.” If an adversary attacks our ICBMs, we’ll know it. If they attack a submarine, we might not. Now, an ambiguous assault on a single submarine would not threaten the U.S. ability to retaliate. But it would lead to uncertainty in a crisis situation, and that is a recipe for disaster</span>. If ballistic missile submarines are going to continue to be “the centerpiece, the core, of our deterrent,” then the forthcoming Nuclear Posture Review should make sure the United States has a clear plan in place for submarine forensics. The administration officials presenting the Review also must be able to reassure members of Congress about attribution ambiguity because rest assured that senators with a parochial stake in ICBMs and bombers will be ready to highlight every chink in the submarine force’s armor.

In addition, such an explosion, especially in times of crises, might be assumed to be a nuclear attack and lead to a nuclear response. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Thus an accidental nuclear explosion may even initiate a nuclear war.</span> In conclusion, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">even if such a catastrophic accidental nuclear explosion does not occur, we have seen that just the dispersal of plutonium</span> due to a HE detonation could lead to several thousand fatalities. Thus, prudence, if nothing else, dictates that India and Pakistan do not deploy nuclear weapons. They should also store them far away from missiles and aircrafts carrying potentially explosive fuel. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A further level of safety may be gained by keeping the weapons disassembled, so that the HE is not close to the fissile material pit. All these steps would not only reduce the danger of accidental explosions, but also reduce the risk of a nuclear weapon being launched through error, panic or miscalculation.</span> </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">5.5 NUCLEAR WARHEAD ACCIDENT ON A SUBMARINE </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">There is the potential for a very major nuclear warhead accident on a submarine</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;"> One Trident submarine could be armed with as many as 96 nuclear warheads in a small area without adequate blast protection between the warheads or from the missiles. In the event of a series of explosions there could be two very serious effects. Nuclear explosion. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">The risk of a nuclear yield becomes significant in a complex explosion on a submarine. Blast fragments could impact on warheads from a variety of directions which would substantially increase the chance that a detonation might produce a nuclear yield</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">. Even a very small nuclear yield, equivalent to a few kg of TNT would present a serious problem because of the generation of fission products and the effects of the intense heat on other radioactive substances and explosives. </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;"> Plutonium dispersal. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">The second risk is the dispersal of a very large amount of plutonium. If each warhead contains 4 kg of plutonium and there are 96 warheads on a submarine then the total amount of plutonium carried is around 0.4 tonnes. This is equivalent to 4,800 million lethal dos</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">es</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">.

The size of particles dispersed would affect the degree of risk to the general public. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">Plutonium would be dispersed over a wide area</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;"> which would lead to long term agricultural restrictions and also to the relocation the local population. </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;"> Figure 16.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">5.3 PLUTONIUM DISPERSAL </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The more likely outcome of a serious nuclear weapons accident is the dispersal of plutonium dust over a wide area.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This could occur during a fire or a conventional explosion. A </span><span class="underline">conventional explosion is regarded as 100 times more serious than a fire,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> because the plutonium would be in the form of fine particles, which are more dangerous. Absorption of plutonium into the human body </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">When plutonium has been dispersed into the atmosphere, the main way in which it is likely to enter the body in the short term is by the inhalation of dust particles.</span> Small particles are particularly dangerous as they can remain in the lung and be transferred to other parts of the body where they remain for many years</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Particle size is very important. Particles larger than 10 microns are likely to be cleared from nasal airways and swallowed. If the particles are smaller than 10 microns then the smaller they are the greater the proportion deposited in the lung. Large amounts of plutonium which are taken into the body can have serious toxic effects in addition to the effects of radiation. If 100 particles of plutonium, each 1 - 10 microns in size, are inhaled then 8 of these particles are expected to reach the bone structure and remain there for many years. After 50 years, half of the particles would still be in the skeleton. Also of the 100, 7 more particles would be retained in various parts of the body for between 6 months and 40 years or more. The remaining particles would be removed from the body more quickly. Alpha radiation is emitted from plutonium for thousands of years. While there is a risk from inhalation of plutonium, there is also a risk, particularly in the long term that a significant proportion will find its way into the food chain. The proportion of ingested plutonium which remains in the body is small. For plutonium dioxide, 0.1% of the amount ingested will remain in the body for a significant length of time. Higher amounts will be absorbed if the plutonium is in a soluble form or if the particles are extremely small. Biological effects of plutonium The alpha radiation from plutonium can only travel a very short distance and cannot penetrate the dead layer of skin around the body. However a particle emitting alpha radiation which is inhaled and absorbed can have a considerable effect on live cells in its immediate vicinity. The relative biological effectiveness of alpha radiation is greater than gamma or beta radiation by a factor of 20. A particle of plutonium can damage cells which are between 10 and 50 microns from it. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Cells have an ability to divide to create more cells. There are natural mechanisms to prevent this division when it is not needed, however the damage caused by plutonium particles and other forms of radiation, can have the effect of disrupting these mechanisms. This results in cells dividing and redividing when they should not. In this way, the inhalation of plutonium dust can result in cancer in the bones, lungs and other parts of the body.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There are also risks of genetic damage. In a male, 3 out of 1000 particles are likely to reach the gonads. In a female the proportion is 1 out 1000. These particles are likely to remain there for many years. They can damage reproductive cells in their immediate vicinity and break the DNA chains within cells. If these breaks are complex, the cell may be unable to repair the damage. This can result in genetic abnormalities in the offspring of the person who is exposed to radiation. Assessing the probability of cancers and of genetic damage is very difficult and not very reliable. Damage to one cell from a small dose of radiation can result in cancer. While the chance of this happening is very small, the damage caused by exposure to a small dose is as great as for a larger dose. However, the larger the dose, the more likely it is that cancer will occur. The same is true of genetic damage. Casualties </span><span class="underline">It has been calculated that if 8 x 10-5 g of weapons grade plutonium is inhaled and 15% is retained in the lung there would be a 100% risk of death from lung cancer. Assuming that one Trident warhead contains 4 kg of plutonium then this is equivalent to 50 million lethal doses. If 2 warheads in a vehicle were to explode the total amount of plutonium involved could be equivalent to 100 million lethal doses. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The risk of contracting cancer would be roughly in proportion with the amount inhaled. The proportion of plutonium which was inhaled as very small particles would be particularly significant. The risk factor for fatal cancer is given by the ICRP as 0.05 per Sv. The risk factor for all cancers is approximately to be 0.075 per Sv. The risk factor for hereditary effects for all future generations is given by the ICRP as 0.01 per Sv for all ages and 0.006 per Sv for people of a working age. Long term behaviour of plutonium in the environment </span><span class="underline">Plutonium which has been dispersed into the atmosphere will continue to be a significant radiation hazard for thousands of years</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Studies have been carried out to assess likely ways in which plutonium which has been discharged can reach the human foodchain and these give some indication of the way in which plutonium behaves in the environment. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In sea water a large proportion of plutonium is expected to accumulate in sediments. The levels of plutonium found in phyto plankton is likely to be high. From plankton the plutonium may then be passed along the food chain to zooplankton, plantiverous fish and pisciverous fish. Plutonium is also likely to be found in shrimps, crabs, lobsters, mussels and gastropod molluscs - algae have a particular ability to concentrate plutonium. Plutonium may also be taken in as food by sea mammals and birds feeding on sea life and feeding between the high and low water marks</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In the case of plutonium deposited on the soil the rate at which it is moved downward will depend on the soil type, for example there is less downward migration in clay soil. Downward migration in soils varies between 0.1 and 1 cm per year. </span><span class="underline">Plutonium may be moved upwards by mycelium and subsequently dispersed into the air in airborne spores. It may be absorbed by microorganisms which are food for protocoa and nematodes. These may then move the plutonium upwards towards the surface</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While downward movement will be the main factor there are also a number of ways in which plutonium will move upwards in the soil. The uptake of plutonium by plant roots is likely to be small, less than one ten thousandth per year, although the proportion will be higher for plutonium in soluble compounds. The proportion is greater if there are more organic ligands and micro organisms present. </span><span class="underline">Plutonium can also be deposited on plants from the resuspension of material on the surface of the soil. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">A high proportion of material which is resuspended will be very close to the ground and so could be deposited on plants. Particular plants show greater ability to concentrate plutonium, eg the lichen which is eaten by reindeer in Northern Scandinavia. Animals are likely to inhale some plutonium through inhalation of resuspended particles. The primary intake for herbivores is likely to be through food. Of the plutonium taken in as food, a proportion of 1 in 10,000 is likely to be subsequently deposited in the bones and liver. Relatively large amounts of plutonium will cause cancers in a range of animals which have been used in experiments. </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Future of the Alliance </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The failure of the Japanese authorities to offer anything but denials and "no documents" responses -- combined with the increasingly compromising facts -- created a deep sense of distrust in Japan toward the U.S. and Japanese governments</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. "You are lying to the people," reporters shouted at one of Suzuki's press conferences,172 and The New York Times described the mood as "the most uncomfortable for American diplomats in Japan in recent memory." Japan's security was based on trust in the United States, Japanese editorials warned, but "an 'alliance' based on falsehood cannot flourish."173 The future of the U.S.-Japanese relationship was also the main theme when Ambassador Reischauer later defended his disclosure in a commentary printed in the Washington Post in June 1981. </span><span class="underline">He warned that it was "unhealthy and even dangerous" for the U.S. government and the Japanese public to have significantly different understandings of the meaning of the word "introduction" of nuclear weapons.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> He said: It was natural in 1960 [...] to handle the problem of nuclear weapons on American ships by simply avoiding mention of the subject. [...] It may have seemed convenient to the Japanese government to bridge the gap by adhering to the old formula in which the American side neither affirmed nor denied the presence of nuclear weapons anywhere and the Japanese simply said that they trusted the United States. But insofar as these two statements covered over a deception, they are unworthy of the sort of relationship that has developed between Japan and the United States, and impair the growth of full trust between them.174 The disclosure of the nuclear transits "understanding" was further substantiated by a report in Jiji Press the following month. The agency cited a declassified U.S. Navy document from October 1958 as referring to an arrangement that permitted nuclear-armed ships to make port calls at U.S. Navy bases in Japan without prior consultation with the Japanese government (see above). In its response, the Japanese government's response completely dismissed the possibility that nuclear weapons were present on visiting warships. Moreover, by ignoring the Reischauer disclosure only a few months earlier, the Japanese government decided to attack the new document on a technicality: Since the document was 15 months older than the January 1960 security agreement, it "obviously [...] does not reflect the environment of the current Japan-U.S. security pact."175 </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Despite the denials, however, it was increasingly clear that Japan's three non-nuclear principles were not a factor at all</span> in U.S. Navy's planning of port visits to Japan. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Instead, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the visits appeared to take place under the terms and conditions of the Neither Confirm Nor Deny (NCND) policy</span>, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">which he oral agreement disclosed by Ambassador Reischauer was intended to serve. </span><span class="underline">Since Japan accepted NCND in operation in its ports, it inevitably also accepted the possibility that nuclear weapons would be onboard ships from time to time</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Otherwise, each visit would indirectly confirm that nuclear weapons could not possibly be present onboard the ships, a confirmation the NCND policy prohibited -- even indirectly. </span><span class="underline">The visit was an operational issue, and Japan's three non-nuclear principles were, for all practical purposes, irrelevant</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Trusting Yet Reminding The Japanese government may have gradually realized that there was a problem, because in February 1983 Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe told the Diet that the Japanese government would once again tell the United States that Japan does not permit nuclear weapons on its territory.176 The move was triggered by a U.S. request for the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN-65) to visit Sasebo. With the 1981 Reischauer scandal fresh in mind, Foreign Minister Abe told Kumashi Kakehashi, the mayor of Sasebo, that he would soon meet with U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield to make sure the U.S. comply with Japan's three non-nuclear principles.177 The initiative was curious one since the Japanese government only three years earlier had insisted that the security treaty effectively prevented U.S. ships from carrying nuclear weapons into Japanese ports without first consulting the Japanese government. If it was so certain then, then why ask now? Rather than an attempt to force concessions out of Washington, the initiative was probably more intended to prevent the national debate from erupting again. After the meeting with Ambassador Mansfield, Foreign Minister Abe told a House of Councilors Committee meeting that Japan had been assured by the United States that the USS Enterprise would not carry nuclear weapons during its visit to Sasebo. Abe explained that the assurance was given when Ambassador Mansfield said the U.S. would abide by the security treaty. "Since [Mansfield] said the United States will comply with the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, we don't have to ask [the U.S. if the USS] Enterprise will bring nuclear weapons to Japan."178 Contrary to Foreign Mininster Abe's assertion, however, Japan did not get any assurances from Ambassador Mansfield that the USS Enterprise would not carry nuclear weapons during its visit to Sasebo. On the contrary, Mansfield's reference to the security treaty ensured that the United States did not commit to anything related to nuclear weapons on the ships. </span><span class="underline">Because the security treaty did not address nuclear weapons, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the Neither Confirm Nor Deny policy's requirement to retain ambiguity about the armament of the ship was maintained</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While timid about its non-nuclear policy vis-a-vis the United States, Japan did not hesitate to enforce its nuclear ban when it came to other nuclear powers. For example, after the British carrier HMS Invincible (R05) had been prevented from using dock-facilities in Australia in December 1983 due to its presumed nuclear armament, the Japanese government announced that the HMS Invincible port clearance would depend on ascertaining whether or not the ship carried nuclear weapons. If Britain declared that it was nuclear armed, or if there were inadequate assurances of no nuclear armament, the clearance would be denied.</span><span class="underline">179 The British government, bound by its own Neither Confirm Nor Deny policy but with no security agreement like the United States to threaten in retaliation if denied access, gracefully canceled the visit. For once the Japanese government had upheld its non-nuclear principle and with no dire consequences for Japanese-British relations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. No sooner had the HMS Invincible story passed, however, before the Japanese media once again carried reports about U.S. nuclear weapons in Japanese ports. The Asahi Shimbun reprinted sections from the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships that stated that two U.S. submarines in several cases during the early 1960s had brought nuclear Regulus missiles into Yokosuka. Once again the Japanese government denied the report, and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told reporters that it was "inconceivable" that such port call had occurred. "Japan strictly abides by the non-nuclear principles and the prior consultation scheme," Nakasone said and added: "I believe that the U.S. has also respected them."180 Although Nakasone did not offer anything concrete in support for his belief, a spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Ryozo Kato, subsequently explained that the U.S. consistently had announced on various occasions that it understands the specific sentiments of the Japanese people on nuclear weapons and sincerely fulfills its duties in accordance with the security treaty. The U.S. State Department, in turn, responded with its assurance that it abided by the obligations under the Security Treaty but would not confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons anywhere.181 </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The Japanese and U.S. governments almost seemed to adhere to two parallel positions, where Japan linked the advance consultation provision to the three non-nuclear principles, while the U.S. linked it to the Neither Confirm Nor Deny policy</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To what extent U.S. and Japanese officials communicated about this division in private still remains unclear, but after Japanese media reported in January 1984 that U.S. congressional records revealed the presence of nuclear weapons in Japan even after the reversion of Okinawa, the U.S. response to the Japanese government did not indicate a great deal of trust. The State Department tried to locate the Congressional documents but was unsuccessful, so it asked the Tokyo Embassy to inform Japanese foreign ministry officials of this and add that the U.S. would neither confirm nor deny the presence nuclear weapons anywhere.182 Moreover, the message to Japan was: </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The details on U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in any one country are closely held on a bilateral basis between the nations involved</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">As you know, the U.S. has always honored, and will continue to honor, its obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and its related arrangements.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">183 </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The message was either an attempt to end further speculation among Japanese officials, or a dry reminder to the Japanese government of the limitations that existed in the U.S.-Japan relationship regardless of whether the accusations in the media were correct or not</span>. "</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Closely held" information about nuclear weapons deployments had previously been pursued by the Sato government in the late-1960s (see above), but denied at the time because it required a much closer and formalized NATO-like alliance than the one Japan enjoyed - or was prepared to have-under the mutual defense agreement. Admiral William Crowe, the CINCPAC, was greatly concerned that Japan would be inspired by New Zealand's non-nuclear stand and change its own port visit procedure. Although the firm rejection of nuclear weapons was the same in both countries, at least in public, Japan accepted the uncertainty of the ship's nuclear armament while New Zealand decided to make up its own mind. In a report to the Secretary of Defense from late 1984, Crowe explained CINCPAC's objective: [The New Zealand government] continues to publicly espouse a policy of denying port access to nuclear armed or powered vessels [deleted]. As you are aware, a number of other countries with nuclear sensitivities, notably Japan, Australia and our NATO allies, are watching closely how we handle this situation. Necessarily...our ultimate objective is unfettered port access while maintaining our NCND policy."184 When the New Zealand anti-nuclear legislation was passed in January 1985, Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone seemed to distance himself from the initiative by saying that it would not have any effect on Japan's three non-nuclear principles. Still, </span><span class="underline">only two years earlier Japan had exercised a New Zealand-type policy in connection with the visit of the British carrier HMS Invincible</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (see above). </span>

<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">NCND DISREGARDS NORMAL CONCERNS</span> AND RIGHTS. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">'The United States Navy has accumulated over 3,000 reactor years of operating experience since Nautilus first went to sea in 1955.' an official report states.1 Despite this seemingly impressive record, </span><span class="underline">there is a serious level of concern in many countries regarding the safety of nuclear powered ships</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is manifested by the Danish Government, for example, in such stringent regulations covering the information that must be supplied if a nuclear powered ship wishes to visit that the United States and other NATO countries will not comply with them, and no United States nuclear powered ship has visited Denmark since 1964.5 Recently a Soviet nuclear powered container ship was denied port access for a week by four of that country's major Pacific ports in a popular protest over nuclear safety, and was only allowed to dock at Vladivostok after an official inspection found no danger from radiation.100 The Australian Senate has recently completed a report on the radiological hazards of nuclear ship visits, visits to Australia by Nuclear Powered or Armed Vessels: </span><span class="underline">Contingency Planning for the Accidental Release of Ionizing Radiation, and is recommending a temporary ban on nuclear powered ship visits to most ports until , their plans for dealing with an accident involving radiation are improved<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span> Public protests at such visits continue in many countries. It is easy to identify visiting nuclear powered ships. These are essentially all naval ships apart from Soviet icebreakers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and are identified as nuclear powered in publicly available sources.9,72 </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The problem of safety for nuclear capable ships visits is completely different because of the workings of NCND. This allows potentially nuclear armed ships to tie up at normal berthing sites often close to densely populated areas in large city centres in many countries,</span> 57 whereas nuclear powered ships are generally berthed in specially allocated areas</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The US Navy will not break NCND even for United States ships in United States ports. To expose people to a danger which many consider to be very serious, </span><span class="underline">a major accident with a nuclear weapon in a city centre, is hard to justify.</span> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">This is even more the case when those exposed are denied the information they need to assess the danger being imposed on them, by the NCND policy in these situations. Governments wishing to undertake actions that may expose their citizens to danger normally inform their citizens of these proposed actions-and! seek approval for them. But governments that grant permission for visits by conventionally powered nuclear capable ships without breaching NCND, as they must do at present, deny their citizens the right to know with certainty whether they are being exposed to danger from the presence of nuclear weapons in their city or not. Consequently, the normal official right to object to proposals involving danger to the public, the ship visits in this case, is denied since the presence of nuclear weapons even if strongly suspected during many visits cannot be proved with NCND operating</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In the case of countries that officially accept nuclear weapons in their ports, their citizens have the right at least to know when this source of danger is present and object if they so wish. The situation is still worse when governments claim their ports are always nuclear weapon free but say they do not challenge NCND,</span> since those governments then cannot ever prove that they are being honest with their concerned citizens, who are left doubting the integrity of their own government. This all applies in peacetime particularly, when military justifications for concealment policies are difficult to sustain in the face of widespread public concern over an issue like nuclear weapons safety. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It can be argued justifiably that conventional weapons on ships in ports constitute a similar threat. The vital difference is that there is no NCND policy covering conventional weapons. In peacetime especially, it is unlikely that a ship's captain would refuse to provide any information at all regarding the conventional armaments of the ship, although details of numbers and types of weapons could be withheld. These can be assessed from publicly available information,72 and people can then respond as they see fit. To substantiate the claim that NCND overrides normal rights </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it is necessary to examine the safety and accident record of nuclear weapons</span>, and naval nuclear weapons in particular. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Officially, the record is claimed to be very good. A report published by the United States General Accounting Office in 1985 relating to naval nuclear weapon accident safeguards and emergency planning states that: Navy ships have operated with nuclear weapons capability for nearly 30 years. Our review of defence records showed that the Navy has had three nuclear weapon accidents. None of these resulted in severe damage to the weapon or release of radioactive material. Further, these accidents did not occur on ships in port or where civilian population or property was endangered.101 A seemingly impressive record, but there is a sustained high level of concern regarding the presence of nuclear weapons. Why is this? The answer is that while the record for major accidents may have been good up to now, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the record for less serious accidents is definitely not good.</span> The above report states that the US Navy reported 229 such accidents, what it calls nuclear weapons related 'incidents' from January 1965 to December 1983</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline">of which 65 involved nuclear weapons on ships in ports</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A detailed account of naval nuclear weapons accidents is given in the report Naval Accidents 1945 - 1988 by W Arkin and J Handler referred to earlier.44 This report includes a table of 383 naval nuclear weapons related </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">'incidents' between 1965 and 1977. Although details of these are not available, the table was compiled from a heavily censored US Navy document, the-total is significantly more than the US Navy reported from 1965 to 1983. Material is also presented that contradicts 58 the claims of a spotless record for naval nuclear reactor operation by the United States. The Soviet record in both these regards is criticised but excessive secrecy prevents large numbers of Soviet naval accidents from being; included in the report. Another survey published in 1988, A Handbook of Nuclear Weapons Accidents, by S Gregory and A Edwards of the School of Peace Studies Bradford University,65 gives details of over 200 accidents of varying seriousness, and the authors conclude that there may be many more still unreported. Some serious</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> accidents were discussed earlier. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">There are many other reports and studies of disturbing accidents or incidents involving nuclear weapon</span>s or their carriers that will not be discussed for the sake of brevity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. From the limited information available, the frequency of these does not appear to be decreasing. Very recently the US Navy sharply curtailed aircraft flights and warship movements for 48 hours after a series of accidents around the world. These included a fire on a nuclear powered submarine, a collision between 'a destroyer and a merchant ship, and United States ships and aircraft firing at or bombing one another.102 Faced with this picture of naval and nuclear weapons safety, </span><span class="underline">it is not surprising that serious concern is felt in many countries,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and that strong reactions are seen against policies of concealment. Another US General Accounting Office report on emergency planning for nuclear weapons accidents released in 1987 states that: </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">No guarantee exists that nuclear weapon accidents involving radiological contamination will not occur in the future</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Thus, to facilitate a prompt and coordinated response, emergency planning for this type of disaster should be coordinated among federal, state, and local agencies as it is for other types of natural and man-made disasters… Since the release of radioactive material from a nuclear weapon accident could be instantaneous and possibly spread to public areas, emergency planning must be in place before an accident occurrs.103</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">THE TIME HAS COME. The neither confirm nor deny policy has been examined in considerable detail. The official bases for maintaining the policy have been discussed and rejected. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A much more unacceptable basis for the high value that is at present placed on the policy by some countries has been suggested, and evidence for its validity has been presented</span>. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Grave problems that the policy raises have been exposed, and benefits that abandoning it would yield described. Mechanisms whereby the policy could be abandoned without serious loss of the values that certain countries now attach to it have been proposed, along with ways in which reluctance to abandon the policy could be overcome. Growing demands for naval arms control and disarmament have been referred to. </span><span class="underline">There are also increasing calls for naval arms to be considered as an integral part of an overall military balance rather than seeking an independent naval balance or parity83 The Disarmament Commission of the United Nations in its ` </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">May 1989 meeting referred for the first time to the NCND principle in its reporting documentation reflecting the suggestion: by several, delegations that the current practice of nuclear weapon States of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons onboard any particular ship at any particular time should be abandoned.149 </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Many suggestions of confidence building measures for naval forces and activities are appearing now, The United States</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and Russia established nuclear risk reduction centres in 1988 to increase communicati</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">on</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, avoid accidental nuclear war and terrorist attacks using nuclear weapons, and signed the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities, designed to help prevent the use of-force in responding to unintentional military incidents.150 Two recent media reports headed US-Soviet Warmth Melts the Cold War and Russians Scratched From the Arms Race(151) spell out clearly the amazing changes'' in superpower relations that are occurring, and the accompanying change in emphasis from military superiority to reductions in military spending that are emerging. (152) The Malta summit late in 1989 again showed the warming in East-West relations that is the mark of these times. President Bush declared: We stand at the threshold of a brand new era of US-Soviet relations. and President Gorbachev responded: The world leaves one epoch of Cold War, and enters another epoch. This is just the beginning of a long road to a long-lasting peaceful period.153 Also at Malta, President Gorbachev is reported to have formally proposed the abolition of all naval tactical nuclear weapons. The proposal would have restricted nuclear weapons at sea to strategic missile submarines. It was rejected out of hand by President Bush, who also refused to include the US Navy in conventional arms control agreements.159 At sea meanwhile there are ballistic missile submarines deployed on which the commanders enjoy a level of autonomy regarding the control of their nuclear weapons not equalled anywhere.98 Soviet submarines are deployed that are seen by experts in the West as a greater danger to their crews than to anyone else.155 Recent Soviet submarine accidents like those discussed under violations support this view. Reports have been appearing for some time that indicate the serious unreliability of some naval and air borne weapons including cruise missiles, and new missiles like Trident 2 and the MX missile have failed in tests.156 The NCND policy is intimately involved in the deployment of, or planned deployment of, these weapons. The contrast between these facts and the rapidly improving situation just discussed is depressing, and must be removed. Eliminating NCND would be a major step in achieving this. 73 The situation in the Asia-Pacific region is also much less encouraging than in Europe. Speaking to a panel of delegates from a Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference meeting in New Zealand late in 1989, the Head of the North East Asia Project at the Australian National University, Professor S Harris suggested the outside perception was that: the United States response to Soviet European developments was far more positive than to Soviet Pacific developments. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">It also appeared that the United States wanted the rest of the world to adjust to its perception but was at the same time slow to respond internationally to a changing world. he said.</span> A report of this meeting states: that it was quite clear from comments by various speakers that the United States is seen as an increasingly destabilising influence as it fails to keep up with change (in the Asia-Pacific region).</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But a United States representative, Mr P Rosenblatt, former White House official and Ambassador to Micronesia, said that: emphasis on economic expenditure as opposed to military expenditure raised the spectre of a destabilising effect in the region, particularly if Mikhail Gorbachev's words did not translate into action.157 The superpower military presence in the region is shown clearly in the Pacific by the presence of large naval and air forces. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Reductions in these forces analogous to reductions underway or proposed in Europe, and the associated easing of the present tensions reflected in the feelings just quoted, would again be asssted greatly by abandoning NCND</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Soviet Union is proposing a meeting of Foreign Ministers from countries in the region to establish a negotiating mechanism for the consideration of all suggestions connected with the region's security, and has suggested further steps to reduce military tensions. These include troop and armament reductions, limits on military exercises, information exchanges, the mutual renunciation of the first use of any weapons, and a tripartite agreement between the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union on preventing incidents in and over the high seas, or between Japan and the USSR to complement the existing US-USSR agreement158 Abandoning NCND would be a very appropriate goal for such negotiations to achieve as a first step to a more secure Pacific. While many of the arguments in this study could fruitfully be extended, it is considered that enough material has been presented to establish the validity of the claim that the neither confirm nor deny policy is oppressive in its working, is obstructive in many important respects, and is obsolete in now lacking any real strategic justification that can outweigh the problems the policy creates. A recent article, Whether to Confirm or Deny?, by Lieutenant N Flacco, US Navy, in which he suggests that 'it may be the right time for the Navy to reconsider its (NCND) policy.' supports many of the arguments presented here.162 </span><span class="underline">NCND is a backward looking policy, a policy of the past, increasingly more out of keeping with changes occurring both This is a time of increasing openness not secrecy, cooperation not confrontation. The time has come for NCND to be abandoned and replaced by measures like those suggested in this study embodied in a policy appropriate to this new era, a policy for the future. </span>

We have the only risk of nuclear war-international norms dictate no country will ever willingly enter conflict.

<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">It is widely acknowledged today among nuclear policy analysts and public officials that a "nuclear taboo" exists at the global level</span>. The taboo is associated with wide- spread popular revulsion against nuclear weapons and widely held inhibitions on their use</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Prominent analysts and theorists of deterrence, such as George Quester, Thomas Schelling, and Bruce Russett, have noted this phenomenon and suggest that it has played a role in explaining non-use.8 As Schelling first noted thirty years ago, the special status of nuclear weapons is something we have come to take for granted today.9 </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">No one today thinks nuclear weapons are "just another weapon."</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Whereas once countries such as Sweden, Switzerland, and Australia assumed they would ac- quire nuclear weapons as simply the latest in modern weapons technology, few think this way today.10 </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">By global level I refer to the collective level of the international community. The taboo is a systemic phenomenon. The shift in international attitudes toward nuclear weapons from 1945 to the present is well documented based on global public opin- 7.</span></span> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">Questions of origins and effects of norms can indeed be separated, since the functioning of a norm may differ from historical explanations for its rise. For example, the rise of the taboo historically has not been a simple function of the interests of the nuclear powers. Indeed, one of the most interesting features of its development is that it has been driven significantly by domestic and international grassroots peace and antinuclear movements, and the norm has developed despite consistent and long-standing official U.S. resistance to it. Ultimately, a nuclear non-use norm is in the greatest interest of small, non-nuclear states, since they have no recourse against nuclear attack other than the restraint induced by the norm. The nuclear powers, in principle, can always rely on deterrence for their security. See Tannenwald, in process. 8. See Quester 1991; Schelling 1994; and Russett 1989.

The decreasing legitimacy of nuclear weapons is not simply reflected in public opinion but has become institutionalized in an array of international agreements and regimes, both multilateral and bilateral, which together circumscribe the realm of legitimate nuclear use and restrict freedom of action with respect to nuclear weapons.</span> <span class="underline">These <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">include nuclear weapons free zones, arms control agreements, "negative security assurances," and the general laws of armed con- flic</span>t</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 11 Although there is no explicit legal prohibition outlawing nuclear weapons use, and its legality remains in dispute, the trend line of decreasing legitimacy and circum- scribed legality is clear. 12 Together, </span><span class="underline">these agreements enhance the normative presump- tion against nuclear use</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and, </span><span class="underline">by multiplying the fora where a decision to use nuclear weapons would have to be defended, substantially increase the burden of proof for any such decision</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.13 The nuclear taboo refers to a de facto prohibition against the use of nuclear weap- ons. The taboo is not the behavior (of non-use) itself, but rather the normative belief about the behavior. In this article, I refer to both norms and taboos. By norm I mean a shared expectation about behavior, a standard of right or wrong. Norms are prescrip- tions or proscriptions for behavior. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A taboo is a particularly forceful kind of norma- tive prohibition that, according to the anthropological and sociological literature, deals with "the sociology of danger."</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 14 It is concerned with the protection of indi- viduals and societies from behavior defined or perceived to be dangerous and typi- cally refers to something that is not done, said, or touched. I use the term taboo because it has often been used by political and military leaders themselves to refer to this normative phenomenon. However, a caveat is in order. The word taboo is generally associated with a stronger and more developed normative prohibition than the word norm and connotes such qualities as absoluteness, unthink- ingness, and taken-for-grantedness. It also involves expectations of awful conse- quences or sanctions to follow in the wake of a taboo violation. In its early days, the norm of nuclear non-use was clearly not a taboo in these senses, even though some decision makers referred to it as such. It has taken on more "taboo"-like qualities as it has developed over time. The fact that the word taboo is used, however, sheds important light on how its users perceive the world. 11. For example, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT, 1968); the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (1996); treaties that create nuclear weapons-free zones in Latin America, Africa, the South Pacific, on the moon, and the seabed; and U.S.-Soviet/Russian nuclear arms control agreements. Fujita 1988. "Negative security assurances" are declarations by the nuclear powers that they will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states party to the NPT. Bunn 1997. 12 In a 1996 advisory opinion, the World Court found that the use or threat of nuclear weapons is "generally" unlawful but said it could not "definitively" conclude whether it would be unlawful in ex- treme circumstances of self-defense if the survival of the state were at stake.

Nuclear Taboo 437 </span><span class="underline">Three Normative Effects I analyze the role of the taboo in terms of three kinds of normative effects: regulative (or constraining), constitutive, and a subset of constitutive effects I call "permis- sive."</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is commonly noted that there are different kinds of norms and rules.15 How- ever, since any given norm can operate in different ways, and may have multiple effects, it is analytically useful to think in terms of different kinds of effects of norms. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Regulative effects, emphasized by rationalist approaches to international relations, refer to how norms constrain or "regulate antecedently existing activities."</span> 16 In con- trast, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">constitutive effects, emphasized by constructivist perspectives, refer to how rules and norms, through actor practices, create or define forms of behavior, roles, and identities</span>.17 The primary regulative effect of the taboo is the injunction against using nuclear weapons first. It constrains a behavior (nuclear use) that would exist whether or not there were any rules about it.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But the taboo also exhibits several constitutive effects: on the categories actors use to understand weapons and on the identity of a "civi- lized" state. Categories provide important boundaries with implications for both be- havior and identity. The taboo helps to define a category of unacceptable "weapons of mass destruction," distinguished from unproblematic "conventional" weapons that are, in contrast, viewed as legitimate and usable. The taboo has also become part of a broader discourse-a set of practices-of the society of states defining what it means to be a "civilized" member of the international community. One of the require- ments for being a "civilized" state is participation in the regulation of warfare-a practice that began among European states during the nineteenth century.18 The nuclear taboo has become part of the contemporary discourse of "civilization," itself a much more deeply embedded or highly "taken-for-granted" norm than the nuclear taboo. It is evoked in such phrases as were used in the Persian Gulf War to demonize Saddam Hussein: "only a barbarian would use nuclear weapons." Finally, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">permissive effects-a subset of constitutive effects-are secondary, indi- rect, or "shadow" effects</span>, often unintended consequences of the operation of a norm. By this notion I refer to the way norms-particularly taboos-by serving as focal points, selectively divert our normative gaze.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> By defining categories of weapons in certain ways, such as "weapons of mass destruction," and drawing our attention to associated normative injunctions, they may obscure other "facts" about the world and shield other practices from attention. Thus one effect of the nuclear taboo, for example, may be to shield non-nuclear weapons from normative opprobrium.</span>

I wouldn't bother with some of the earlier neg strats, mostly because their local tournaments and disclosed just because its a regional wiki.
