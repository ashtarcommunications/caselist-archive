**Contention One in the Status quo**

**The US has not invited China to the ISS, in response China has built its own station**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Dellios ’12</span> (Rosita, Associate professor at Bond University, "China and outer space" (2012). Humanities %26 Social Sciences papers. Paper 571.http://epublications.bond.edu.au/hss_pubs/571)
Meanwhile, in low Earth orbit, China is constructing a manned space station as
AND
as part of China~’s the 12th five-year plan (Xinhua 2011b).

**But their station is compatible with the ISS as a sign of potential cooperation**

Observers describe the program as slow, systematic and cautious. According to the Chinese
AND
2011 US federal spending bill that explicitly prohibits NASA from collaborating with China.

**And Chinese conservatives are focusing on a militaristic space program—now is key to develop stable relations**

Not being proactive and assuming the status quo is sufficient is a dangerous policy.
AND
the same degree, a dangerous prospect for U.S. interests.

**Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its space exploration using the International Space Station, including an offer to the People’s Republic of China of participation in joint International Space Station missions.**

**Advantage 1 is Weaponization**

**Scenario One is Chinese Miscalculation:**

**China’s rapid militarization of space is caused by American unilateral space leadership, making a cycle of Chinese miscalculated space war inevitable in the status quo**

After reviewing Chinese counterspace capabilities and possible motivations, the question at hand, again
AND
, so why not share resources and capabilities in the pursuit of such activities

**And space wars escalate into a US nuclear attack on China**

A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of ~’peace through strength~’ deterrence
AND
space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.



**And a US first strike decimates the Chinese geography– causing environmental extinction in 24 hours**

What would happen if China launched its 20 Dongfeng-5 intercontinental ballistic missiles,
AND
with China. Such advice is worth heeding by nuclear hard-liners.


**Scenario Two is American miscalculation**

**The US is uneasy about current Chinese space development- the government perceives China as a threat**

China~’s military space program and its strategies for space warfare have caused rising concerns in
AND
China to explain the objectives of its rapidly advancing military space program.1

**And the archaic international relations system that the US prescribes to makes conflict with China and miscalculation inevitable as the long as the US holds unilateral leadership in space**

Although many U.S. experts are correct in emphasizing the importance of space
AND
seeks to expand its military capability, others have to take similar measures.

**A US led space attack on Chinese assets would be supported with a nuclear attack on Chinese terrestrial assets**

Having crossed a space Rubicon with their ASAT demonstrations, neither nation can un-
AND
ladder to a more damaging war both sides would probably want to avoid.

**Chinese disinterest in terrestrial conflict with the US, internal problems, and lack of a National Security Council all supercharge the risk of escalation by miscalculation**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">MacDonald 11</span> (Bruce W., United States Institute of Peace, USIP.org, "Testimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission on The Implications of China~’s Military and Civil Space Programs" 5-11-11 [[http://www.usip.org/files/resources/bmacdonald_testimony.pdf-http://www.usip.org/files/resources/bmacdonald_testimony.pdf]] )
In the face of this growing Chinese military space challenge, it is easy to
AND
control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead.

**US-China war causes global nuclear extinction**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Hunkovic, 2009</span>(Lee J, American Military University 2009, "The Chinese-Taiwanese Conflict Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan and the United States of America", [[http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/Hunkovic.pdf-http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/Hunkovic.pdf]])
A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate
AND
outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.


**Advantage 2 is US-Sino Relations**

**US-Sino relations are falling apart: China is being forced to advance space weaponization to keep up with the arms race, ensuring miscalculation and an East Asian arms race**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Neil 11</span> (Alexander, head of the Asia Security Programme at the Royal United Services Institute,1-11-11 "Viewpoint: A new Sino-US high-tech arms race?"

Beneath the veneer of official smiles and neatly choreographed handshakes at the defence summit in
AND
space domain creates a lingering atmosphere of uncertainty and mistrust in the region.

**Action now is key: the US policy of exclusion creates a cold war style arms race that uniquely kills US-Sino relations**

Space is another critical shared arena of potential interest-based engagement which must be
AND
it could suffer an erosion of its leadership over the long term.50

**No cooperation over space ensures that any attempt to boost relations will fail**

In Washington~’s space security community the debate has coalesced around the question of whether the
AND
this would strengthen US national security and international stability in the Pacific region.

**They will say yes because China uniquely desires prestige—and the ISS uniquely is the best forum for cooperation-solves transparency**

(Daniel M., "Does China have a comprehensive, coordinated, and consistent space policy? Implications for U.S. policymakers," p. 58-59)
Finally, the U.S. could be more accommodating to Chinese participation in
AND
spacefaring nation and is willing to initiate actions to build communication and trust.

**And cooperation over space is vital to spur cooperation on nuclear terrorism and space debris.**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Kulacki 11</span>(Gregory, a senior analyst and the China Project manager for the Union of Concerned Scientists 6/23/11, Volume 474, Nature, "US and China need contact, not cold war", [[http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nwgs/Kulacki_US-China-coop_Nature_6-23-11.pdf//~~]-http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nwgs/Kulacki_US-China-coop_Nature_6-23-11.pdf//sb]] )
Some see a moral argument behind the bans on US–China collaboration, arguing

and if China fails to address them it will harm the US public.

In addition to the direct-ascent ASAT capability demonstrated in January 2007, China
