Inherency
OBSERVATION ONE IS THE STATUS QUO DOES NOT PROMOTE HIGH SPEED RAIL:

The US federal government will not invest any money for High-Speed rail in the 2013 budget despite Administration requests
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Fox 12</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Joel Fox, Editor of Fox & Hounds and President of the Small Business Action Committee, “You Can’t Build High Speed Rail With No Money”, Fox and Hounds, April 18, 2012. [[http://www.foxandhoundsdaily.com/2012/04/you-cant-build-high-speed-rail-with-no-money/]])</span>

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Hence the plan:</span>

Text: The United States federal government should substantially increase its investment for an express train infrastructure system through a public-private partnership program.
1AC Economy
ADVANTAGE ONE IS THE ECONOMY:
__Subpoint A:__ First, the U.S. faces continued high unemployment, below average growth and the risk of a double-dip recession.

Subpoint B: Economic decline causes war—best studies prove it’s a bloody transition and there are multiple scenarios

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Alternatives to growth kill hundreds of millions and cause global conflict—we can’t “//turn off//” the economy.</span>

Subpoint C: We Solve
First is Megaregions:
Suburbanization makes US economic growth unsustainable – the US needs a new spatial shift towards development of megaregions
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Florida 10</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(7/12/10, Richard Florida is Senior Editor at The Atlantic and Director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto, “The Roadmap to a High-Speed Recovery”, [[http://www.tnr.com/print/article/economy/76961/richard-florida-reset-recovery-economy-future]])</span>

High speed rail is the key – it’s a __shovel-ready__ project that accelerates the development of mega-regions and results in massive job growth

Second is Stimulus:
High speed rail has a multiplier effect on the economy – only the plan solves short and long term growth

Gerard, [[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leo-hindery-jr/job-creation_b_1517730.html]]] )</span>

Third is competitiveness:

1AC Warming

ADVANTAGE TWO IS WARMING:
Subpoint A: Warming is real and anthropogenic

Transportation emissions will increase by nearly 2% a year --- they are a primary contributor to global warming. Current green technologies will fail to curb the trend without a high speed rail system.

Subpoint B: Warming causes multiple scenarios for mass extinction—hydrogen sulfide emission stratifies the ocean, destroys conveyor currents, kills the ozone, and linked to the past five extinctions

1AC Solvency
CONTENTION 2 IS SOLVENCY
