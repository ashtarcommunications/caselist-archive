The United States Congress should substantially increase acquisition of commercially hosted Space Based Infrared System satellite payloads.



1AC Infra-Red


__Advantage One is Infra-Red__

A host of problems are delaying Air Force acquisition of new infra-red satellites
**__Defense Industry Daily ‘11__** (“Despite Problems, SBIRS-High Moves Ahead,” 6-28-2011, http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Despite-Problems-SBIRS-High-Moves-Ahead-With-3rd-Satellite-Award-05467/)
**__The Space Based Infrared System__** __(SBIRS)-High satellite program **is a key component of the** USA’s **future missile alert system, designed to give maximum warning and monitoring of ballistic missile launches anywhere in the world**. The new satellites will replace the existing Defense Support Program (DSP) fleet. Their infrared sensors have 2 times the revisit rate and 3 times the sensitivity of DSP, while providing better persistent coverage. Unfortunately, the program **has been beset by massive cost overruns** on the order of 400%, **technical challenges** that continue to present problems, **and uncertain performance**. **Despite** these **problems, the** U.S. **Air Force is proceeding with the program, even as it terminates potential alternatives** and supplements__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. SBIRS – High: Current State Contracts and Key Events [updated] Additional Readings SBIRS – High: Current State The SBIRS team is led by the Infrared Space Systems Directorate at the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA. Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Sunnyvale, CA is the SBIRS prime contractor. Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems in Azusa, CA as the payload subcontractor, and Lockheed Martin Information Systems & Global Services in Boulder, CO is the ground system subcontractor. SBIRS-High GEO are satellites. SBIRS-High HEO (High Elliptical Orbit) are payloads hosted on spacecraft with classified launch dates. At present, 2 HEO are in service, and a 3rd HEO payload is prepping for launch. The first SBIRS High HEO payload was declared operational in November 2008. The first SBIRS-High GEO satellite was expected to launch in 2010, after significant delays. SBIRS GEO-1 wasn’t delivered to Cape Canaveral until March 2011, and the launch won’t take place until May 2011 at the earliest. </span>__According to US GAO auditors**,** the **SBIRS** program **has suffered from** immature technologies, unclear requirements, **unstable funding**, underestimated software complexity, **poor oversight, and other problems** **that have resulted in** billions of dollars in cost overruns and **years in schedule delays**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The cost of the program has ballooned from an original $4 billion estimate to over $17 billion. </span>**__Normally, this__** __kind of performance **would produce program cancellation, but** **the USAF had no alternatives for** a mission that must be carried out: **early ballistic missile detection**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>


But, the military won’t abandon current plans to purchase entire satellites one at a time despite the proven viability of alternative architectures
**__Iannotta ‘11__** (Ben Iannotta, “Hosted payload launch could set precedent,” Defense News, 10-1-2011, http://www.defensenews.com/article/20111001/C4ISR01/110010310/Hosted-payload-launch-could-set-precedent)
**__The__** __launch of the U.S. Air Force's **Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload** (CHIRP) **could point the way toward money-saving tweaks to the blueprints for U.S. military satellite constellations**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, Air Force officials said. A French Ariane 5 rocket boosted the $82.5 million CHIRP sensor into stationary orbit over the United States on Sept. 21. The payload consists of a telescope and infrared detectors that will stare at Earth from a perch on the SES-2 communications satellite, which is part of the fleet operated by SES World Skies, the Dutch satellite communications provider. CHIRP, whose development was about a year late, was built by the Air Force and SAIC. Air Force engineers will test CHIRP's ability to detect the heat of missiles launched at test ranges in New Mexico or Arizona. </span>__The CHIRP mission is viewed as more than a technical test, however__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Air Force had to work through numerous issues with SAIC, satellite builder Orbital Sciences Corp. and SES to get it into orbit. Because CHIRP's development was late, SES had to assign it a different satellite than originally planned. The problems have not dissuaded the Air Force from interest in hosted payloads. Earlier this year, the Air Force set up a hosted payload office to explore the possibility of launching additional intelligence sensors and communications antennas on commercially owned satellites. </span>__The Air Force's thinking is that **hosted payloads could take over** some of **the functions performed by free-flying military satellites, allowing the service to buy smaller and cheaper** versions of today's military spacecraft__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. "I don't think you're going to see a step function that we're going to say, ‘We're not going to build satellites anymore,'" said </span>__Air Force Lt. Gen. Ellen Pawlikowski, commander of the Space and Missile Systems Center__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in Los Angeles. Pawlikowski told reporters at the Air Force Association conference in Washington, D.C., that she </span>__envisions hosted payloads possibly taking over__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> some of the tactical communications performed by the Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites, and </span>**__missile-spotting duties performed by the__** __Space-Based Infrared System (**SBIRS**) **satellites**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__CHIRP was designed several years ago as an alternative to the technology aboard the SBIRS spacecraft, whose development at the time was **jeopardized by technical mistakes**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__If **the CHIRP experiment** goes well, Pawlikowski said, she **did not** expect the Air Force to **change the blueprint for SBIRS in the near term**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__"Would we get to the point where we'd say we're not going to build SBIRS seven and eight? That's a possibility__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">," she said. </span>**__The first SBIRS__** __geosynchronous **satellite is in orbit. Lockheed Martin is under contract to deliver three more, with planning underway** at the Air Force **for procurement of a fifth and sixth satellite**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span>


This ensures capability gaps – only the plan can launch the full array in time to solve
**__Butler ‘10__** (Amy Butler, “Stratcom Rings Missile-Warning-Gap Alarm,” Aviation Week, 4-19-2010, http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&id=news/awst/2010/04/19/AW_04_19_2010_p35-219773.xml&headline=Stratcom%20Rings%20Missile-Warning-Gap%20Alarm&prev=10)
**__Concerns are__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> once again </span>**__surfacing at__** __U.S. **Strategic Command about a** potential **gap in the critical mission area of space-based missile warning**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Last December, U.S. Air Force Gen. Kevin ­Chilton, Stratcom commander, issued </span>**__an urgent-need request__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> to the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) office </span>**__for alternatives to augment the mission__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, according to Lt. Cmdr. Steve Curry, a Stratcom official. </span>**__At issue is the timing of a transition between the__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Defense Support Program (</span>**__DSP__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">) </span>**__constellation__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">—built by TRW (now part of Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems) and in orbit—</span>**__and the new__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Space-Based Infrared System (</span>**__Sbirs__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">) </span>**__constellation__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> being manufactured by Lockheed Martin Space Systems. </span>**__Delivery of__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Sbirs GEO-1, which will be </span>**__the first spacecraft__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> bound for geosynchronous orbit to replace DSP, </span>**__is__** __at least **seven years late**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. And the program, now estimated at $15 billion, is costing far more than expected. </span>__DSP, and eventually Sbirs, will provide the early cue for defenses in the event of a ballistic missile attack against the U.S. or points abroad__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__However, the availability of GEO-1 is not part of the coverage-gap worries__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Gen. Robert Kehler, Air Force Space Command chief, says the satellite will likely be launched in early 2011 (although this date is not firm), and officials are exploring ways to extend the life of the DSP constellation. The second Sbirs satellite is slated to be lofted roughly a year after GEO-1. But </span>**__there was a gap in purchasing the third satellite and beyond, and this could__** __potentially **lead to holes in coverage**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Another thorny issue is related to the in-orbit failure of DSP-23, the final satellite in the series. However, DSPs in orbit are lasting longer than designed, says Lt. Gen. John Sheridan, commander of the Space and Missile Systems Center, which purchases USAF satellites. The ORS office was established to explore ways to decrease the time to develop and deliver satellites and launchers; commanders have been frustrated that most military satellites take 10 years or more to deliver. Furthermore, the office is exploring ways to cut the cost of satellite development. However, it has also been asked to address commanders’ specific requests quickly, such as Chilton’s urgent need for missile warning. As such, the ORS office has become a way for commanders to bypass the traditional, bureaucratic acquisition system. “The specific need is in the space mission area of missile warning,” Curry says. “Gen. Chilton is committed to using all available means, including the ORS office, to achieve Stratcom’s Unified Command Plan responsibilities.” Last year, Chilton raised a similar alarm, which led to the brief stand-up of a program called the Infrared Augmentation Satellite (IRAS) system. It was terminated in the final throes of the Fiscal 2011 budget request late last year, around the same time Chilton issued the urgent-need request to ORS. One senior defense official likened his persistence on the issue as a “rite of spring,” noting that one year after Chilton’s push for IRAS, “the new thing is the degree of urgency.” A senior Air Force official says </span>__it is a “good idea” to pursue a backup plan in the event Sbirs slips further or a DSP experiences a failure. However, no funding has been set aside__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Stephen Toner, vice president of the Sbirs infrared sensor program at Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems, says </span>**__the models used to predict coverage gaps are “very conservative.”__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Last month, Peter Wegner, ORS office director, provided suggestions from his review to Chilton for the missile warning requirement, says Curry. The office is now exploring various design and research paths. </span>**__One option is to prepare sensors—produced__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> by Raytheon and SAIC </span>**__under the Alternative Infrared Satellite System__**__—for flight. These sensors were developed **as a backup** should Sbirs GEO satellites encounter more delays. **The first** SAIC sensor **is**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> slated to be launched in the first quarter of 2011 on an SES Americom satellite, built by Orbital Sciences as </span>**__a commercially hosted payload experiment to demonstrate the ability of a large infrared__** __focal-plane **array to execute this mission in space**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Sheridan says </span>**__a new system could be ready in two years, and the cost is in the “tens of millions of dollars.”__**


But, making a firm commitment now is key

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The U.S. Air Force announced Thursday </span>**__an__** __innovative **infrared missile detection sensor launched** in September **on a commercial** communications **satellite is functioning as expected, fulfilling a groundbreaking partnership between the private and public space sectors**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Artist's concept of the SES 2 satellite in orbit. Credit: Orbital Sciences </span>__The Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload, also known as CHIRP__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, was powered up in late October on the SES 2 communications satellite, a privately-owned spacecraft launched Sept. 21 from French Guiana. CHIRP features a wide field-of-view infrared staring sensor that covers one-quarter of the globe from an orbit 22,300 miles above the equator. The Air Force uses infrared sensors to detect missile launches and support other military missions. Developed by Science Applications International Corp., CHIRP will detect bright spots against the backdrop of Earth. Infrared space sensors can monitor large explosions and wildfires, in addition to their primary missile early warning mission. </span>**__Not only is CHIRP testing a next-generation sensor that could be applied to future programs, the payload is hosted on-board a commercial satellite, a new paradigm that could save money for the Defense Department__** __and other government agencies__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. "This is an important first step for the Air Force," said Col. Scott Beidleman, director of development planning at the Space and Missile Systems Center in Los Angeles. "Now that the payload completed functional check out, the next step is calibration followed by execution of planned experiments. Analysis results will provide actionable information for acquisition decision makers. Also, </span>__given the path-finding nature of CHIRP, the Development Planning Directorate is gathering invaluable lessons learned on these technologies and commercial hosting__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">." </span>**__The Pentagon and NASA are looking into placing hosted payloads on more commercial satellites, especially given heightened funding pressures in a tough government spending environment__**__. NASA followed the progress of the CHIRP program and sent a representative to French Guiana for CHIRP's launch on a European Ariane 5 rocket__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__The CHIRP program cost $216 million, including payload development expenditures. **A single dedicated** Air Force **S**pace-**B**ased **I**nf**r**ared **S**ystem **satellite** for missile warning **costs more than $1.2 billion, and that figure doesn't include development spending**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Diagram of the CHIRP payload. Credit: SES Government Solutions </span>**__The CHIRP staring sensor is also less complex and provides improved performance of the SBIRS global scanning payload__**__, according to the Air Force__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. "The business proposition is very tempting," said Antonio Elias, executive vice president for advanced programs at Orbital Sciences Corp., a leading industrial proponent of hosted payloads. According to an Air Force spokesperson, CHIRP had a budget of $82.5 million integration, launch and operations. Owned by SES World Skies and manufactured by Orbital Sciences, the SES 2 satellite is positioned along the equator at 87 degrees west longitude. Its transponders are designed to beam television and digital media to North America. Orbital Sciences devised an architecture for hosted payloads to hook up to one of a satellite's transponders. Engineers added an antenna to listen for commands for CHIRP, intercept the signal and direct the message to CHIRP. A similar data path is available to downlink information back to Earth. "We invented a device to allow an instrument to cleverly hijack communications on a channel without having to wire anything on the spacecraft," Elias said. The design minimizes interference with the SES 2 satellite's primary communications mission, and it reduces the cost and complexity for CHIRP, according to Elias. Orbital says it offers the hosted payload option on all of its satellites, but the final decision is up to the spacecraft owner. SES Government Solutions agreed to place the CHIRP payload on the SES 2 satellite. Elias said hosted payloads require government customers to change their attitude from traditional multi-billion dollar programs with long development times. "For hosted payloads to really work, the government customer has to change their mindset. They have to develop a little bit based on speculation," Elias said. Commercial communications satellites are built in two years, while the design and development of advanced sensors for a specific military mission can take much longer. So a payload needs to be almost ready for flight before it can assigned to a host satellite. Orbital is leading satellite integration and testing for the next-generation satellite fleet for Iridium, a leading mobile communications provider. The Iridium NEXT constellation consists of 81 satellites, including spares, and are available for hosted payloads. </span>__The **Iridium NEXT** program **represents an unprecedented opportunity for hosted payloads, but the company** says it **needs commitments by the end of 2012**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Iridium CEO Matthew Desch said it's doubtful every slot for a hosted payload will be filled on Iridium NEXT. "</span>**__The train is leaving now__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">," Elias said. </span>


We’ll isolate multiple scenarios:


First is __Early Warning__:

Current launch detection satellites are on the brink of failure – delays in replacement risk collapsing deterrence – only the plan solves

Thompson, Chief Operating Officer of the Lexington Institute, former Professor and Deputy Director of the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University, Ph.D., M.A., Government, Georgetown University, B.S., Political Science, Northeastern University, “New Satellite Provides ‘Just-in-time’ Deterrence,” Space News, 6-15-2011, http://www.spacenews.com/commentaries/110613-sat-just-in-time-deterrence.html)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">It was a big relief to U.S. defense officials in May when the first geosynchronous satellite in </span>__the Space Based Infrared System__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (</span>**__SBIRS__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">) successfully reached orbit. The new spacecraft </span>**__is equipped with sensors that will provide the first indication of hostile missile launches, nuclear explosions__** __and other heat-generating events__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> around the globe relevant to national security. </span>__Such information is **essential to nuclear deterrence, which**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> as currently practiced </span>**__requires the__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> nation’s </span>__strategic **arsenal to be capable of** surviving an attack and then **retaliating in a controlled and proportionate manner**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__If news of enemy missile launches is not received quickly, the ability of U.S. forces to respond effectively might be so uncertain as to impair the entire structure of deterrence__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__There isn’t much doubt that the SBIRS constellation will be a big improvement over existing__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Defense Support Program </span>__satellites__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Each of the four geosynchronous satellites positioned about 36,000 kilometers above the equator will carry a scanning sensor with three times the sensitivity and twice the revisit rate of legacy sensors, plus a staring sensor that can provide persistent, higher-resolution coverage of specific areas (like Iran or North Korea). </span>__The sensitivity and timeliness of information generated by the new satellites will also enable the SBIRS constellation to provide valuable reconnaissance for the nation’s ballistic missile defense system, conventional warfighters and intelligence analysts. But the__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> core </span>__mission__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, the one </span>__that matters most, is assuring sufficient warning of hostile missile launches so that the nation’s nuclear arsenal can credibly deter aggression__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__What many observers don’t grasp is how tenuous the existing missile warning system has become__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__The first and most vital line of defense__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in that system </span>__since 1970 has been the legacy satellites that SBIRS will replace__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Prime contractor Northrop Grumman has introduced numerous upgrades to the Defense Support Program satellites that have improved their reliability, sensitivity and survivability. </span>__However__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, a review of the program’s launch history indicates that </span>**__the Air Force has managed to successfully launch only one__** __of the **satellite**s **in the last 10 years** — which is **very worrisome when** you consider that **the** nominal **design life**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> for the latest versions of Defense Support Program satellites </span>**__is only five years__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Fortunately, the satellites typically exceed their design life by 250 percent, and some have lasted even longer. But there’s a reason engineers specify conservative design lives, so </span>__the fact that the last successful launch of a legacy satellite occurred in 2004 means that **America’s missile warning network is living on borrowed time**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__Under the original SBIRS development plan, there was little danger of a gap in missile warning. The new spacecraft were supposed to begin reaching orbit in 2002, providing plenty of time to transition from the legacy constellation to the new one. But a variety of hardware and software problems delayed the program by many years, and then in 2008 the last__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (and most recently launched) </span>__D__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">efense </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">upport </span>__P__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">rogram </span>__spacecraft mysteriously failed in orbit__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__It was the unforeseen combination of **SBIRS delays and a legacy satellite failure** that **got policymakers scrambling to identify options for fill**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/xuyun/Desktop/Debate/2011-12/Emory/Doubles/SBIRs%20CHPS%201AC%20New%20-%20Emory%20-%2011%201-28%20Windows%20User.doc#_msocom_1|[K1]]] </span>**__ing a potential gap in missile warning__**__. **What they learned to their dismay is that there weren’t any viable alternatives to** stretching out the performance of the D__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">efense </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">upport </span>__P__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">rogram </span>__and **straining to get SBIRS into orbit as soon as possible**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. There are a number of possibilities for squeezing more life out of the Defense Support Program satellites, from reducing the fuel margins required for boosting them into retirement orbits to working around the failure of specific components in an architecture designed for redundancy. </span>__But **at this point**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> some of </span>**__the satellites in use must be “single string” spacecraft__**__, meaning **there are no backups for key functions**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, because the most recent Defense Support Program satellites still believed to be functioning were launched in 2000, 2001 and 2004. That’s a long time to be operating continuously in space without any repairs. The launch of SBIRS sensors on two National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) satellites in highly elliptical polar orbits beginning in 2006 has somewhat diminished the danger while bolstering confidence in the sensors to be carried on the more capable geosynchronous birds. But the sensors hosted by NRO can’t provide the coverage afforded by near-circular equatorial orbits at geosynchronous distances, so </span>**__there’s no alternative to fielding the full SBIRS architecture__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__Policymakers appear to believe that the legacy constellation will be viable through 2013, after which SBIRS will have to assume most of the missile warning mission__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Thus, a lot is riding on the success of the GEO-1 satellite that reached orbit in May. With solar panels and antennas deployed, operators are testing the twin sensors and other on-board equipment to make sure they meet performance specifications. SBIRS has been an uncommonly controversial program that began during a period of turmoil in space acquisition and was saddled with more requirements than any satellite should have to meet (three times too many, the Defense Science Board said in 2003). But the most capable part of the system has now reached orbit with all of its “key performance parameters” intact, which is a major achievement for prime contractor Lockheed Martin and payload integrator Northrop Grumman. It is also a big victory for the U.S. Air Force, which stuck with the SBIRS architecture despite years of criticism. Its leaders understood the urgency of replacing legacy missile warning satellites before they failed. However, </span>**__it will still be some time before the constellation is fully deployed, so the danger has not passed__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__The bottom line on nuclear deterrence is that it isn’t likely to work unless U.S. leaders have reliable information about what other nuclear powers are doing, and right now SBIRS is the only solution that can meet that need in a timely fashion__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>


Declining confidence in early warning risks accidental nuclear war
**__Graham ‘5__** (Thomas Graham, Jr., former special representative of the president for arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament, participated in every major U.S. arms control and nonproliferation negotiation from 1970 to 1997, “Space Weapons and the Risk of Accidental Nuclear War,” Arms Control Today, Dec 2005, http://www.armscontrol.org/print/1953)
**__The U__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__and Russia maintain thousands of nuclear warheads__** __on long-range ballistic missiles **on 15-minute alert**. **Once launched, they cannot be recalled**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and they will strike their targets in roughly 30 minutes. Fifteen years after the end of the Cold War, </span>__the chance of an accidental nuclear exchange has far from decreased__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Yet, the United States may be contemplating further exacerbating this threat by deploying missile interceptors in space. </span>**__Both the U__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__and Russia rely on space-based systems to provide early warning of a nuclear attack__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. If deployed, however, U.S. space-based missile defense interceptors could eliminate the Russian early warning satellites quickly and without warning. So, just the existence of U.S. space weapons could make Russia’s strategic trigger fingers itchy. The potential protection space-based defenses might offer the United States is swamped therefore by their potential cost: </span>**__a failure of__** __or false signal from **a component of the**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Russian </span>**__early warning system could lead to a disastrous reaction and accidental nuclear war__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__There is no conceivable missile defense__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, space-based or not, </span>__that would offer protection in the event that the Russian nuclear arsenal was launched at the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates. Nor are the Russians or other countries likely to stand still and watch the United States construct space-based defenses. These states are likely to respond by developing advanced anti-satellite weapon systems.[1] These weapons, in turn, would endanger U.S. early warning systems, impair valuable U.S. weapons intelligence efforts, and increase the jitteriness of U.S. officials. The Dangers of Failed Early Warning Systems The Russian early warning system is in serious disrepair. This system consists of older radar systems nearing the end of their operational life and just three functioning satellites, although the Russian military has plans to deploy more. The United States has 15 such satellites. Ten years ago, on January 25, 1995, this aging early warning network picked up a rocket launch from Norway. The Russian military could not determine the nature of the missile or its destination. Fearing that it might be a submarine-launched missile aimed at Moscow with the purpose of decapitating the Russian command and control structure, the Russian military alerted President Boris Yeltsin, his defense minister, and the chief of the general staff. They immediately opened an emergency teleconference to determine whether they needed to order Russia’s strategic forces to launch a counterattack. The rocket that had been launched was actually an atmospheric sounding rocket conducting scientific observations of the aurora borealis. Norway had notified Russia of this launch several weeks earlier, but the message had not reached the relevant sections of the military. In little more than two minutes before the deadline to order nuclear retaliation, the Russians realized their mistake and stood down their strategic forces. Thus, 10 years ago, when the declining Russian early warning system was stronger than today, it read this single small missile test launch as a U.S. nuclear missile attack on Russia. The alarm went up the Russian chain of command all the way to the top. The briefcase containing the nuclear missile launch codes was brought to Yeltsin as he was told of the attack. Fortunately, Yeltsin and the Russian leadership made the correct decision that day and directed the Russian strategic nuclear forces to stand down. Obviously, </span>**__nothing should be done in any way further to diminish the reliability of the space-based components of U.S.__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and Russian </span>**__ballistic missile early warning systems__**__. **A decline in confidence in such** **early warning systems**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> caused by the deployment of weapons in space </span>**__would enhance the risk of an accidental nuclear weapons attack__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/xuyun/Desktop/Debate/2011-12/Emory/Doubles/SBIRs%20CHPS%201AC%20New%20-%20Emory%20-%2011%201-28%20Windows%20User.doc#_msocom_2|[K2]]] </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Yet, as part of its plans for missile defense, the Pentagon is calling for the development of a test bed for space-based interceptors as well as examining a number of other exotic space weapons. In an interview published in Arms Control Today, Lt. Gen. Henry Obering, director of the Missile Defense Agency, touted what he said was “a very modest and moderate test-bed approach to launch some experiments.” Obering said the Pentagon would only deploy a handful of interceptors: “We are talking about onesies, twosies in terms of experimentation.”[2] </span>


Extinction
**__Morgan ‘9__** (Dennis Ray Morgan, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, South Korea, “World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race,” Futures, 41(10), December 2009, ScienceDirect)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question “Is Nuclear War Inevitable??” [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what most terrorists obviously already know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange. As Moore points out, all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian “dead hand” system, “where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,” it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States” [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal “Samson option” against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even “anti-Semitic” European cities [10]. In that case, of course, Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And </span>__what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on. **Any accident**, mistaken communication, false signal__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> or “lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason </span>**__could, in a matter of__** __a few **minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons**, and **once a weapon is used**, then **the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is** actually **less probable** since **each country would act under the “use them or lose them” strategy** and psychology; **restraint by one power would be interpreted as** a **weakness** by the other, **which could be exploited as a window of opportunity** to “win” the war__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In other words, </span>__once Pandora's Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, “everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self-determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors” In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and </span>**__once even just one is used, it is very likely that__** __many, if not **all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of** much of **human civilization** while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span>



Second scenario is __BMDS__:

Both U.S. commitment to, and international perception of, a multi-tiered ballistic missile defense system is inevitable – and most of it is already deployed – no offense
**__Futter ‘11__** (Andrew Futter, POLSIS, University of Birmingham, “The elephant in the room: US ballistic missile defense under Barack Obama,” forthcoming in Defence and Security Analysis, 2011, http://birmingham.academia.edu/AndrewFutter/Papers/454984/The_elephant_in_the_room_ballistic_missile_defence_under_Obama)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">According to the Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR) Report released by the Pentagon in early February 2010, </span>__the “Phased, Adaptive Approach” to BMD in Europe will become the template for US BMD policy in other regions of the world. Moreover, the BMDR makes it clear that the Obama Administration is pursuing this approach because of, and not instead of, the capability to defend the US against a limited long-range missile threat. When this is combined with the large-scale multilateral BMD effort central to the Obama BMD plan, the increased role for BMD in nuclear deterrence outlined in the Nuclear Posture Review and the bullish commitment not to accept restraints on BMD policy in either the New START agreement with Russia or in discussions with China, there is strong evidence to suggest that, rather than seeing BMD relegated in importance, its significance to US policy is increasing__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. On 1 February 2010, the Pentagon released the first official Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report that had been mandated by Congress and started back in March 2009. Along with the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), both of which emphasized the role and growing importance of BMD for the Administration, the BMDR was designed to provide a detailed overview of the Obama Administration’s strategic policy. The Review outlined six main goals of the US BMD programme: 1. Continue to defend the homeland against limited ballistic missile threats 2. Defend against regional missile threats to US forces, allies and regional partners 3. Deploy capabilities only when proven through testing 4. Ensure commitment to new capabilities is fiscally sustainable over the long-run 5. Ensure the programme is flexible enough to adapt as threats change 6. The US will seek to lead expanded international efforts on missile defence. The most fundamental aspect of the Report was the confirmation that with 30 Ground Based Interceptor missiles currently deployed in silos in Alaska and California and twinned with an expansive network of radar and sensors, the Obama Administration felt that the US was currently protected against a limited long-range missile threat. According to the Report, “The United States is currently protected against the threat of limited ICBM attacks as a result of investments made over the past decade”. It continued, that consequently, “the United States will refocus its homeland missile defence plans to maintain the current level of capability whilst continuing to hedge against future uncertainties”. As a result of this development, the Report maintains that more focus and energy can be concentrated on objective number two, namely protecting US troops and allies overseas from shorter-range missile threats through “regional based adaptive approaches that are tailored to the threats facing each region, the capabilities available, and the technologies best suited for deployment”. To this end, </span>__the Report announced that the Obama Administration would be pursuing “Phased Adaptive Approaches”, based on the new European model, in specific regions – primarily Europe, the Greater Middle East and East Asia – but also elsewhere around the world that would be “tailored to the threats and circumstances unique to that region”__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. According to the Report, these would enable “a flexible, scalable response to BMD threats around the world by incorporating new technologies quickly and cost-effectively and by maintaining a focus on current threat assessments”. </span>__Moves have already been made to begin implementing the Review’s recommendations__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and, in particular, to ‘Strengthening International Cooperation’. For example, in early February 2010 </span>__the State Department announced that agreements had been reached for Romania (and__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> possibly </span>__Bulgaria__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">) to become part of the European “Phased Adaptive Approach” by agreeing </span>__to host the land-based SM-3 interceptors needed for phase two of the programme planned for 2015, with Poland having already__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> tacitly </span>__agreed to house the Northern onshore SM-3 interceptor site needed for phase three scheduled for around 2018__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__The Obama Administration has also pushed ahead expediently to integrate the new plan with NATO’s “ALT-BMD” programme, and other missile defence assets in Europe__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. To this end, Alliance leaders have already announced that that the European PAA “reinforces NATO’s central role in missile defense in Europe”. Moreover, in co-ordination with the PAA, NATO has also endorsed the US plan to provide missile defense coverage over all European member states as part of the New Strategic Concept agreed at its 19-20 November 2010 Summit meeting in Lisbon. </span>__In concert with the BMD developments in Europe__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, which in many respects is the first tangible embodiment of the new missile defence plan, the Obama Administration has also begun implementing the sixth main objective of the Review which declares that multilateral and bilateral efforts would be stepped up with various US allies in regions across the world. The intention is that these allies should help share the burden and establish a network of regional missile defences across the globe to supplement the US system. In late January 2010, for example, </span>__it was announced that the US would be fielding additional PAC-3 interceptor batteries in four Middle Eastern Nations bordering Iran__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> as a buffer against potential Iranian retaliation to the economic sanctions related to Teheran’s nuclear programme. </span>__Two Patriot PAC-3 batteries each were to be deployed in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, whilst Aegis warships began maintaining a continuous presence in the waters around the Persian Gulf__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In addition, the UAE amongst others, has also expressed interest in buying US THAAD BMD batteries. </span>__Supplementing this is a nascent phased, adaptive approach – in all but name – in East Asia to combat the potential threat from North Korea. When added to the Obama Administration’s desire to push ahead with BMD cooperation with Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, this points to an extensive US missile defence commitment in the region__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__The rationale and dynamics of the BMDR was also firmly grounded in **the Administration’s** FY**2011 BMD budget** request in which the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) **requested** $8.4bn for BMD (totalling **nearly $10bn** overall__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">). The focus continued to be on combating the short- and medium-range regional threats to US troops and allies throughout the world. To this end $1.6bn, was requested </span>**__for__** __the **Aegis sea-based** system__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, $859m </span>__for **THAAD**, and__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> $281m </span>__for the **“Aegis ashore”** programme__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__The Ground-based interceptor__** __programme would receive $1.3bn__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, but this would be </span>__for completing further missile silos__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> at Ft Greely and not for additional deployments of interceptors, which would be held at 30. Notably, $319m was requested </span>__for **joint SM-3 development with Japan and significant funds for joint-cooperation on the Arrow BMD system with Israel**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. However, just days before the budget was released, Congressman Michael Turner (R-Oh), described the FY2011 budget request as, “the litmus test of whether the Administration is truly committed to its missile defense policy or merely paying it – and our nation and allies – lip service”. His observation is a useful indication of the continued misperception of what is really happening with BMD. As a result, </span>__far from suggesting that BMD has shrunk in importance, **there is every reason to conclude that it will become even more enmeshed and enshrined within both US and international security thinking**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For example, the most obvious future implication of the “Phased Adaptive Approach” for Europe is that the US may have the capability to intercept all types of missiles aimed at Europe and the US from this region, including potentially part of the Russian nuclear arsenal. If this is taken as a model across the globe, which according to the BMDR it is, then it is quite conceivable that </span>**__there will be a considerable expansion of US BMD activity in the near future__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__One further aspect that highlights the Obama Administration’s determination to push ahead with BMD, has been the fact **these plans have continued to be pursued despite strong** and growing **Russian and**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, to a lesser extent </span>**__Chinese, concerns__**__. More specifically, the fact that the Obama Administration forcefully and stubbornly rejected Moscow’s attempts to link the negotiations over New START to the limitation of future US BMD deployments is a strong indication of the importance Obama places on missile defence__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Although critics have made much of the unilateral Russian statement on BMD that accompanied the signing of </span>**__the new START Treaty__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in April 2010 – which added to the perception that the Obama Administration was trying to limit and downgrade BMD - the Treaty nevertheless contains no official limits on US missile defences. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates unequivocally declared in a May 2010 Wall St Journal op-ed that, The Treaty </span>**__will not constrain the U.S. from developing and deploying defenses__** __against ballistic missiles, as we have made clear to the Russian government. **The US will continue to deploy** and improve the **interceptors** that defend our homeland — those based **in California and Alaska**. We are also moving forward with plans to field missile defense systems to protect our troops and partners **in Europe, the Middle East, and Northeast Asia** against the dangerous threats posed by rogue nations like North Korea and Iran__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Gates, Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, other senior Obama Administration officials, as well as numerous other foreign policy specialists, have firmly rejected claims that the Treaty in any way limits US missile defence plans. In addition to this, </span>__another factor that points to the centrality of BMD is **the renewed enthusiasm within the** Obama **Administration – and** within **NATO - to establish** some type of **BMD cooperation with Russia**. Such an agreement **may offer the possibility of removing BMD as a major stumbling block in US-Russian relations**. **It might well provide a springboard for more BMD expansion**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and perhaps a basis for agreeing to further nuclear arms cuts. </span>**__Even relatively rudimentary cooperation, such as__** __coordinated deployments or the **sharing** of **missile launch data, would** appear to **offer reassurance that the system is not aimed at Russia** or that it could it be used against them__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has argued, “Politically, it would be a clear demonstration that the missile defense system is not directed against Russia … And militarily, it would make the whole system more effective”. </span>__To this end, the Obama Administration has sent delegations to Moscow and, in coordination with NATO, has been holding talks with Russian officials about collaborating on BMD__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The January 2011 meeting of the NATO-Russia Council, for example, involved serious consultations on the possible creation of a European missile defense system and other joint projects. </span>**__Ballistic missile defence__** __therefore **seems likely to remain a centrepiece of** the Obama Administration’s national security **strategy for the foreseeable future**. Although applied slightly differently from the Bush Administration, it represents a continuation of, rather than a break from, past policy__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. If the programme for Europe is to be taken as an example, </span>**__the result may well be a more comprehensive system of missile defences than even__** __the **Bush** Administration might have **envisaged**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The key difference is that with the homeland theoretically protected, the focus of the programme has shifted to improving and strengthening the complementary protection of forward-deployed US forces and allies against regional threats. CONCLUSION: BMD IS ALIVE, WELL, AND THRIVING UNDER OBAMA </span>__Despite the views of many prominent conservative and, to a lesser extent, liberal commentators, ballistic missile defence remains an integral component of the Obama Administration’s national security strategy. Rather than scaling the programme back or relegating its importance, there has been a conscious effort to recalibrate the programme, not diminish it__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Part of this tactical change has been driven by the 30 GBI’s already deployed in Alaska and California, which the Pentagon is confident gives the US the capacity to defend itself against a limited future long-range missile threat. Consequently, </span>__the Obama Administration has turned its attention to strengthening complementary systems designed to protect against short and medium-range missile threats in regions across the world__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The decision to alter, rather than cancel, missile defence in Europe is a revealing example of this new approach. </span>__Underpinning this change in tactics, is the intention to give the BMD system more flexibility to deal with different types of threat, utilise different types of technology, and address concerns in different regions as and when such **a** need arises. In essence the objective is to retain some sort of **flexible “missile defence surge capacity” to deploy around the world, in addition to the stationary system deployed in the US**. As such, there has been a continuation, rather than a deviation, from the Bush Administration’s goal of developing **a global layered missile defence system**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The most valuable insight into how BMD policy will develop under Obama was revealed by </span>__the February 2010 Ballistic Missile Defence and Nuclear Posture Review Reports__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, which </span>__strongly suggest that BMD is, and will remain, a key component of security strategy. In addition to maintaining a robust homeland defence and strengthening regional defences the BMDR makes it clear that **a central component of the Obama BMD plan will be to enlist international cooperation** for US BMD efforts. **A likely effect** of this approach **will be** the **greater acceptance of BMD as a legitimate and key part of US security strategy**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The NPR also makes it clear that the Administration sees an ever-increasing role for BMD in US homeland and extended deterrence. </span>__Although developments in politics, technology and the ballistic missile threat will inevitably condition and shape the future of BMD, there is much to suggest that missile defence will continue to become further entrenched in US and international security thinking, especially if BMD co-operation can be successfully pursued with Russia. Consequently, whilst changes in future dynamics could mean that fewer assets are deployed than have been stated, the opposite is also true. The Obama Administration certainly has not ruled out changing and upgrading this strategy if circumstances change. Either way it seems ballistic missile defence is alive and thriving under Barack Obama__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>


But, full SBIRS coverage is essential to the effectiveness of all missile defenses – gaps risk failures
**__Prouty ‘8__** (Scott J. Prouty, “Ballistic Missile Defense System Sensors and the Role of Space Systems,” Crosslink, Spring 2008, http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/spring2008/02.html)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The Aerospace Corporation is assisting the Missile Defense Agency with defining requirements, identifying new technologies, and integrating existing sensor capabilities for the Ballistic Missile Defense System. Aerospace is also applying rigorous testing and systems engineering expertise to the development and operation of the system. </span>__The mission of **the Missile Defense Agency** (MDA) is to develop and field an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) that provides the homeland, deployed forces, friends, and allies with a layered defense against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight. To fulfill this mission, the agency **is developing**, testing, **and integrating sensors, interceptors, and** a **Command and Control**, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) system **into a global architecture that must work to detect, track, and intercept enemy missiles**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. MDA relies on a variety of sensor systems operated on land and sea and in space to provide the information required to engage missile threats. Sensors used by the BMDS to detect and warn of upcoming threat launches include radio-frequency and electro-optical infrared sensors, MDA-developed sensor capabilities, and sensor capabilities developed by other agencies that are integrated into the BMDS. Except for the MDA Space Tracking and Surveillance System, space systems fall into the sensor capabilities developed by other agencies. Aerospace is extensively involved in the integration of these sensor data from sources developed by agencies outside MDA into the BMDS. Integrating these data allows MDA to take advantage of the significant investment in hardware, software, and talent that exists in the nation’s space program. In cross-agency integration, MDA engineers and acquisition professionals work with other agencies to develop products and services that interface between systems. Aerospace works across the development process to make space sensor data a valuable tool for the BMDS. These Aerospace activities are integral to BMDS systems engineering and also to the assessment of the utility of current and future space capabilities to support the BMDS. Aerospace has developed MDA requirements for current space systems, defined architectures for future systems, and identified key technologies that require development to meet future BMDS needs. In addition, Aerospace provides systems engineering expertise to the development and testing of </span>__BMDS-dedicated ground processing__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> that </span>__takes sensor data from space sensors-to include the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS)__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and others-</span>__and develops products that could potentially support BMDS operations__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__One product from this work is the fusion of infrared sensor data to develop boost-phase track messages that can identify missile position and velocity to support cueing of BMDS ground radar assets. This cueing allows for much more efficient use of radar resources, thereby increasing BMDS performance__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This capability has been demonstrated in MDA flight tests and is now in the process of being folded into more rigorous BMDS testing. Once proven in testing, it will be a candidate for transition to operations. BMDS Sensor Architecture BMDS relies primarily on fixed and transportable radar assets located around the world. These radars include X-band radars in the forms of the Sea-Based X-band (SBX) radar and the AN/TPY-2 forward-based radar; the SPY-1 S-band radar on Aegis ballistic missile defense ships; the Theater High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) radar; the Upgraded Early Warning Radars (UEWR); and the Cobra Dane radar. </span>**__The space sensor assets that can most readily be incorporated into BMDS are overhead nonimaging infrared assets__**__. These systems include **the SBIRS**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and Defense Support Program </span>**__satellites__**__, which were **designed to sense the infrared energy from a missile in flight**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. An X-band (wavelength 2.5-4 cm; frequency 8-12 GHz) radar can search, detect, and track missiles, and distinguish between warheads and countermeasures. The SBX radar is built upon a movable sea platform that will improve the ability to acquire, track, and discriminate countermeasures during the midcourse phase of flight. The AN/TPY-2 radar provides information early in the flight of a potential ballistic missile launch and helps discriminate threat reentry vehicles from associated countermeasures. The THAAD radar is an X-band, phased-array, solid-state radar that will provide extended coverage and the ability to engage incoming missiles more efficiently. The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program provides an early line of defense against ballistic missiles. The Aegis S-band (wavelength 8-15 cm; frequency 2-4 GHz) radar ensures target detection in adverse weather where X-band radars can potentially be heavily affected by sea or rain clutter. The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system also includes the UEWRs and the L-Band Cobra Dane radar. These radars provide long-range missile surveillance, acquisition and tracking, and object classification, as well as update information for the BMDS exoatmospheric kill vehicle(s). Functionality and Support </span>**__Space sensors__** __**fulfill five functions** in supporting the BMDS__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In the </span>__first, **"situational awareness,"**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> a number of national systems provide information to the warfighter/operator about the actions </span>**__and__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> intent of an adversary. </span>__Next, sensors send **a wakeup call**-the "bellringer"-informing an operator **that a threat missile launch has taken place** and that the defense system should be alerted to be ready to respond. The Overhead Nonimaging Infrared (ONIR) missile-warning satellite system, to include the **SBIRS**, **is the primary provider** from space systems **of this type of information**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The </span>__third__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> function, </span>**__"sensor-to-sensor cueing," allows a sensor with a threat missile in track to pass__** __pertinent **information** on that missile **to another sensor so that it can** efficiently **pick up the missile**. **Again**, this is **a function** from space systems **primarily fulfilled by** the **SBIRS** and ONIR system. The fourth and fifth functions, **"launch on" and "engage on," occur when the weapon system assigned to defend against the incoming threat is activated** based on the space sensor information. Accuracy of the information available from the sensor system and the capability of the weapon system differentiate the criteria of these two functions. In other words, **does the accuracy and timeliness of the information available** for the sensor system **allow for the weapon system to close the fire control loop and launch and negate an incoming threat missile? Sensor accuracy, timing, information latency, coverage, and availability** are **all** system attributes that **determine if a** possible **sensor system is capable of supporting these five functions**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For example, </span>__highly accurate **information that is too late or** timely information that is **inaccurate can negatively affect the execution of the BMDS mission**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This balancing act between accuracy </span>**__and__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> timeliness is one of the major design trades that continues to be investigated and analyzed within MDA and the external sensor community. In addition, </span>**__limited coverage and availability can adversely affect__** __the benefit of a sensor to support **the mission**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Why Space Sensors? </span>**__Space systems provide global coverage and a wide-area search capability__**__, allowing space sensors to monitor the globe looking for missile launches. These space sensors provide the global look **that ground- and sea-based radars cannot** because of their more limited fields of regard__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Though ground- and sea-based radars have a more limited field of regard, these radars generally provide more detailed and accurate information on the threat to the BMDS and provide the fire-control quality data for the weapon system. </span>__The persistent, global coverage of space assets when integrated with the accuracy of ground and sea-based radars allows the BMDS to take advantage of the best performance attributes of each sensor type for improved integrated sensor performance in support of BMDS mission capabilities__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span>


An effective multi-tiered BMDS is key to deter and deny all missile threats – specifically, prevents war with North Korea and Syrian bioweapons use

__Twenty-first century threats to the United States, its de­ployed forces, and its friends and allies differ fundamental­ly from those of the Cold War. **An unprecedented number of international actors have** now acquired – **or are seeking to acquire – missiles**. These include not only states, but also non-state groups interested in obtaining missiles with nucle­ar or other payloads. The spectrum encompasses the missile arsenals already in the hands of Russia and China, as well as the emerging arsenals of a number of hostile states__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__The character of this threat has also changed. Unlike the Soviet Union, these newer missile possessors do not attempt to match U.S. systems, either in quality or in quantity. In­stead, their missiles are designed to inflict major devasta­tion without necessarily possessing the accuracy associated with the U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals of the Cold War.1 **The warning time that the U**nited **S**tates **might have be­fore** the **deployment** of such capabilities **by a hostile state, or even a terrorist** actor, **is eroding as a result of** several fac­tors, including the continued proliferation and widespread availability of technologies to build missiles and the result­ing possibility that an entire system might be purchased out­right.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Would-be possessors do not have to engage in the pro­tracted process of designing and building a missile. They could purchase and assemble components, reverse-engineer a missile after having purchased a prototype, or immediately acquire a number of assembled missiles. Even missiles that are primitive by U.S. standards might suffice for a rogue state or terrorist organization seeking to inflict extensive damage upon the United States. As the Rumsfeld Commission point­ed out in its 1998 report: Rogue States </span>__North Korea__ __In the years since the surprise launch of its three-stage Tae­po Dong 1 missile over Japan in August 1998, **North Korea has made substantial advances in its ballistic missile capabilities and** now possesses the largest ballistic missile force in the developing world, according to Jane’s Information Group.3 Pyongyang has engaged in extensive efforts to conceal the size and scope of its ballistic missile programs, though es­timates suggest that it may have deployed as many as 1000 ballistic missiles, including some 600-800 Scud-type short-range rockets, between 150 and 200 medium-range No Dong missiles, and 50 other longer-range missiles.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">4 In 2003, North Korea lifted its self-imposed 1999 mora­torium on long-range missile testing.5 In July 2006, the Kim Jong-il regime fired a Taepo Dong 2 long-range missile as part of a series of missile tests.6 While the 2006 test failed 40 seconds after launch, it signified a considerable advance in the development of North Korea’s extended-range missile capability. </span>__The Congressional Research Service has indicat­ed that the Taepo Dong 2’s design would allow it to deliver a 1,500-kilogram warhead to targets as far as 8,000 kilometers away.7 According to 2005 testimony by Vice Admiral Low­ell Jacoby, USN (Ret.), former director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), **Pyongyang’s** Taepo Dong 2 **mis­sile “could deliver a nuclear warhead to** parts of **the U**nited **S**tates in a two-stage variant and target all of North Ameri­ca with a three-stage variant.”8____He also stated that North Ko­rea had achieved the ability to arm a missile with a nuclear device. North Korea has had a declared nuclear capability since 2005.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">10 In 2008, North Korean officials admitted that 37 ki­lograms of plutonium had been produced at the Yongbyon reactor, enough for as many as nine nuclear weapons.11 American assessments suggest that the actual amount of plutonium produced is likely much higher and that as much as 60 kilograms could have been extracted.12 </span>__Based upon this judgment, **North Korea may have as many as 15 nucle­ar weapons**, though most estimates in the U.S. intelligence community place the number at around ten__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.13 The extent of North Korea’s uranium enrichment program is not well known, but Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer (A.Q.) Khan stated that he had provided uranium enrichment equipment to Pyongyang.14 In 2002, DPRK First Vice For­eign Minister Kang Sok-ju admitted that North Korea was pursuing a uranium-enrichment program, the clear impli­cation being that the program was meant for weapons pro­duction.15 An operational North Korean uranium program could have the capability to add as many as six additional nuclear weapons a year to Pyongyang’s arsenal.16 A resolu­tion to the North Korean nuclear weapons dilemma has yet to be achieved, despite the various efforts to use the six-par­ty talks and other efforts for this purpose.17 </span>__Iran__ __**With** the benefit of **assistance from** abroad, including **North Korea and Pakistan**, the Islamic Republic of **Iran has moved forward with its ballistic missile program**. Iran has had a demonstrated tactical ballistic missile capability since the 1980s, but in June 2003 it marked a major milestone when it deployed its 1,300-kilometer-range Shahab-3, capable of targeting Israel and Turkey, as well as U.S. forces in the Per­sian Gulf.18 Since then, Iran has begun “mass production” of This work has yielded impor­tant dividends: in September 2007, Iran publicly unveiled a “new” medium-range ballistic missile, the Ghadr-1, at a mil­itary parade in Tehran.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> This missile, which Iran claims has a range of 1,800 kilometers, appears to be an extended-range variant of the Shahab-3.21 Subsequently, </span>__in November 2007, Iran carried out a test of its Ashoura missile, a 2,000-kilo­meter-range solid fuel variant of the Shahab.22 These steps are part of what U.S. officials believe is a growing emphasis in Tehran on the development of an inter­continental ballistic missile capability.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As John Rood, then-acting assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, told Congress in May 2007, “The In­lah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. </span>__The transfer of the Shahab 3 into the Pasdaran, in lieu of the Artesh, suggests that Ira­nian missile technologies could find their way into terrorist hands as part of Tehran’s ongoing sponsorship of terrorist activities. Intelligence Community assesses that **Iran would be able to develop an ICBM capable of reaching the U**nited **S**tates and all regions of Europe **before 2015** if it chose to do so.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> And, I would point out that Iran has acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea in the past and note the possibility that it could do so again in the future, potentially acquiring mis­siles with even longer ranges.”23 </span>__As a result of these advanc­es, it is likely that Iran could field an intercontinental ballis­tic missile by the middle of the next decade.24 Iran may have conducted tests to determine whether its ballistic missiles, notably the Shahab-3 or the Scud, could be detonated by re­mote control while still in flight.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The significance of such a capability lies in its potential to launch an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, discussed later in this section. </span>__This effort is closely linked to Iran’s growing interest in space. In October 2005, Iran became the first space nation in the Muslim world when it launched a surveillance satellite on a Russian rocket from Russia’s missile base at Plesetsk.25 Since then, Iran has made great strides toward development of an indigenous space launch capability.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In February 2007, it successfully carried out an initial test of a “space rocket” built in Iran.26 A year later unveiled its first space center, with Tehran claiming that it had now “joined the world’s top 11 countries possessing space technology to build satel­lites and launch rockets into space.”27 </span>__These advances ampli­fy and expand Iran’s ballistic missile program, since a space-launch vehicle (SLV) is similar in technology and function to the booster on an intercontinental ballistic missile. The threat posed by Iran’s ballistic missile program is closely linked to Tehran’s nuclear effort.__ <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Since it was pub­licly exposed by an Iranian opposition group in August 2002, Since December 2007 Iran has built a stockpile of low-enriched uranium hexafloride. According to the IAEA, Iran’s stockpile had reached more than 1000 pounds by August 31, 2008, with monthly production rates of more than 100 pounds. In 2009 this could give Iran at least 1,500 pounds that could be recirculated through its centrifuges to pro­duce the 35 pounds of weapon-grade uranium sufficient for one bomb.31 In April 2008, Iranian president Mahmoud Ah­madinejad disclosed that his government had begun to in­stall another 6,000 centrifuges at the Natanz facility.32 Ira­nian leaders have taken this to be a critical milestone. “The nuclear issue (of Iran) is the most important political devel­opment in contemporary history,” Ahmadinejad announced to supporters at that time. “Iran’s victory in this biggest po­litical battle will lead to new international developments.”33 </span>__Thus **all indicators point toward** the development of an **Ira­nian nuclear capability** with varying estimates **not** about **whether** Iran is doing so, **but** instead **when** it will have such weapons. There have also been reports that Iran as well as North Korea, and even terrorist groups, could have benefited from information from the notorious A.Q. Khan proliferation network. In 2006 drawings were discovered on computers owned by Swiss businessmen that included how to build a warhead that could be fitted on an Iranian ballistic missile. Whether these drawings were earlier passed on to Iran is not certain. The nuclear-related documents allegedly included hundreds of pages of specifications for a compact nuclear device that could have been designed for Iran.34__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Other states already possess or are developing weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. They include: Pakistan• , which has had a nuclear capability at least since 1998 and has extensive ballistic and cruise missile pro­grams. Pakistan possessed as many as 100 nuclear war­heads and continues to upgrade its missile forces. The country has made major advances in missile technology, especially considering that it presently lacks the domestic science and technology base for developing such weap­ons, which suggests that it has been very successful in acquiring technologies from abroad. At the moment, Pak­istan’s longest-range ballistic missile is the Hatf-6, which has a range of 2,000 kilometers. At that range, the Hatf-6 is nearing the 2,500 kilometer threshold which the Rums­feld Commission indicated would mark the existence of the technical base necessary for the development of long-range missile systems. While Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles are • ostensibly intended to deter Indian aggression, Pakistan’s domestic political situation is so turbulent that there is no guarantee that these weapons will be used strictly for that purpose. For example, under a radicalized regime such missiles could be used against U.S. forces and mili­tary installations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite Paki­stan’s cooperation in the War on Terror, serious questions exist as to whether elements in the Pakistani security services, in particular the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), are actively working against U.S. inter­ests by supporting Afghan and Pakistani Taliban fighters in the Pakistani tribal areas. The fact that such powerful elements could be operating outside official Pakistani policy channels is frightening, even though ISI does not directly supervise the nuclear arsenal. Pakistan’s nuclear forces are overseen by the National Command Author­ 34 ity (NCA), and underwent a thorough security upgrade in 2003. Nevertheless, concerns remain about the com­mand and control of Pakistan’s nuclear forces. Particu­larly troubling is the level of sympathy for al-Qaeda and the Taliban within the junior and mid-level cadres of the Pakistani military as a result of fighting side-by-side with Islamists against Indian forces in Jammu and Kashmir. It is precisely these officers who are most likely to be pro­moted to sensitive positions in the years ahead. </span>**__Syria__**__•__ __, which **maintains biological and chemical weapons capabilities and possesses a large inventory of** surface-to-surface **ballistic missile systems, could deliver** con­ventional and unconventional **warheads to neighboring countries** in the Middle East.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">35 </span>**__Syria has__** __also **shown** more than a passing **interest in acquiring a nuclear** weapons **capability,** as evidenced by the construction the Al-Kibar reactor site, which was subsequently destroyed by an Is­raeli Air Force strike in September 2007.____The Central In­telligence Agency (CIA) has estimated that Damascus possesses hundreds of free-rocket-over-ground (FROG) missiles, Scud missiles, and SS-21 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs).36 Syria also maintains the indigenous capability to manufacture liquid-fuel Scuds.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">37 In Septem­ber 2003 testimony before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, then-Under Secretary of State John Bolton outlined </span>__that **Syria “is fully committed to expanding** and improving **its** CW [chemical weapons] program” and “is continuing to de­velop an **offensive biological weapons capability**.”38 Syr­ia’s mobile missile force is **capable of targeting** much of **Israel,** as well as parts of **Iraq, Jordan, and Turkey**, and it has “developed a longer-range missile – the Scud-D – with assistance from North Korea” while simultane­ously pursuing “both solid- and liquid-propellant mis­sile programs.”__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">39 Egypt• , which is engaged in a clandestine effort to acquire WMD and ballistic missile technologies. Egypt has been a primary destination for North Korea’s ballistic missile exports and has received shipments of Scud B and C mis­ 35 siles, as well as No Dong missiles.40 Inspections by the IAEA have uncovered plutonium traces at Egyptian nu­clear facilities, increasing international concern about clandestine nuclear development efforts on the part of the Mubarak regime.41 The IAEA has also criticized Cairo for failing to declare certain nuclear materials and sites, one of which was a facility for separating plutonium that could be used in an atomic weapon.42 Saudi Arabia• , which will undoubtedly find a nuclear weapons program a more attractive option if Iran achieves nuclear status and may already be pursuing a nuclear hedging strategy. Under an agreement signed during the October 2003 visit to Islamabad by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, Riyadh reportedly gained access to Pakistani nuclear technologies in exchange for stepped-up energy cooperation and improved strategic relations with Pak­istan.43 While Saudi Arabia has denied that it is devel­oping a nuclear weapons capability, it has been granted “small quantities protocol” status from the IAEA, which removes strict oversight of its nuclear reactor and could potentially facilitate the clandestine pursuit of nuclear weapons.44 Riyadh, meanwhile, was reported to be seek­ing modern replacements from China for its aging arse­nal of CSS-2 missiles originally purchased from China more than a generation ago.45 Strategic Competitors People’s Republic of China According to the Defense Department, “China has the most active ballistic missile program in the world. It is develop­ing and testing offensive missiles, forming additional missile units, qualitatively upgrading certain missile systems, and developing methods to counter ballistic missile defenses.”46 PRC missile modernization efforts build upon current capa­bilities that encompass ballistic missiles able to target the United States as well as Japan and other regional U.S. allies. For example, China has over 46 Dong-feng 4, Dong-feng 5, and Dong-feng 31 intercontinental ballistic missiles, approx­imately 35 intermediate-range (Dong-feng 3, and Dong-feng 21) missiles, and hundreds of short-range rockets currently deployed.47 Between 990 and 1,070 SRBMs are deployed op­posite Taiwan, and the People’s Liberation Army is increasing this force by more than 100 missiles each year.48 At the same time, China is in the midst of a massive, multi-year strategic-military modernization program, encompassing air power, naval, and land force capabilities, air defense, and electron­ic-, information- and space-warfare technologies.49 As part of this effort, China is upgrading its existing bal­listic missile arsenal. This includes the deployment of its Dong-feng 31 and Dong-feng 31A ICBMs with multiple inde­pendently targetable re-entry vehicle (MIRV) warhead tech­nology designed to defeat primitive anti-missile systems, priority solid-fuel propellant research intended to provide Beijing with immediate “launch on command” capabili­ties, and the transformation of its strategic offensive forc­es from large, stationary missiles to more versatile road- and rail-mobile variants. Notably, a successful flight test of China’s new submarine-launched version of the Dong-feng 31, the Julang 2, was conducted in June 2005.50 The Julang 2 has a range of up to 9,600 kilometers and, according to the U.S. Air Force’s National Air Intelligence Center, “will, for the first time, allow Chinese [missile submarines] to target portions of the United States from operating areas located near the Chinese coast.”51 These capabilities are even more troubling in light of remarks made by Chinese Major Gener­al Zhu Chenghu, who declared that nuclear weapons would have to be used if the United States intervened militarily in a conflict over Taiwan.52 In addition, China has also begun to undermine Ameri­can space dominance and is developing asymmetrical op­tions to exploit perceived U.S. vulnerabilities in space. These include a variety of space-denial capabilities, as well as space assets and launch systems that will significantly augment Beijing’s space operations. For example, in the wake of its successful October 2003 launch of the Shenzhou V space­craft, China is developing advanced military capabilities as part of an exo-atmospheric “deterrent” force even while Bei­jing warns against any U.S. weaponization of space. In Jan­uary 2007, China successfully destroyed a Chinese weather satellite using a direct-ascent, anti-satellite weapon, indi­cating its ability to attack satellites operating in low-earth orbit. Beyond the hit-to-kill technology demonstrated in this operation, the PRC is also developing technologies to “jam, blind, or otherwise disable satellites.”</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">53 </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">China has also developed a range of “nano-satellite” technologies for spacewarfare, apparently for the purpose of crippling American space assets.54 Other Chinese advances in space include the Ziyuan 1 and Ziyuan 2 remote-sensing satellites and the develop­ment, through a joint venture between China’s Tsinghua University and the United Kingdom’s University of Surrey, of a constellation of seven mini-satellites (weighing between 101 and 500 kilograms) with 50-meter-resolution remote-sensing payloads.55 Furthermore, there is growing evidence that China is increasingly interested in developing an EMP capability, both as a theater weapon for use in a potential Taiwan conflict and as a strategic asset to counter the Unit­ed States.56 Beijing’s space achievements also include the Shenzhou VII, the third Chinese manned spaceflight, together with China’s first spacewalk in September 2008.57 In addition, China is working on in-orbit rendezvous and docking pro­cedures (which also have direct applications for ASAT and space-denial missions), and exploring the prospects for a manned space station. The Shenzhou VII mission and space­walk will provide China with docking techniques required for the construction of a space station that will reportedly be accomplished by joining two Shenzhou vehicles togeth­er. Moreover, the PRC has an elaborate lunar exploration program that includes an unmanned moon lander, a sam­ple return mission, and an eventual human mission to the moon. For these missions, Beijing is developing a new Long March V booster. The timetables for the Chinese unmanned moon landing, a sample return mission, and a manned lunar mission are believed to be 2012, 2015, and 2017, respectively. China’s manned moon mission is approximately three years ahead of the U.S. target date for returning to the moon. Another extremely troubling development is the PRC’s increasing efforts in the realm of cyber warfare, particular­ly as a means to attack U.S. infrastructure, computers, and associated networks. Such asymmetrical efforts underscore Beijing’s understanding of the increasing role played in U.S. military operations by command, control, communication, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems. The objective of the PRC is to establish elec­tronic dominance early in any conflict scenario in order to disrupt and downgrade the utility of such assets, while si­multaneously taking steps to ensure that an adversary can­not deny China access to its own information systems.58 The inescapable conclusion is that Chinese strategic force mod­ernization, space denial and anti-access capabilities, and cyber warfare activities provide clear evidence of a strategy aimed at degrading the ability of the United States to proj­ect power and support its allies in the region and thus un­dermining the credibility of the U.S. extended deterrent. To address these challenges, the United States must ensure that it remains the preeminent space power. Russian Federation With the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Repub­lics (USSR), the Russian Federation inherited the sprawling Soviet ballistic missile apparatus, which includes medium- and long-range solid- and liquid-fueled missiles. Presently, Moscow retains a formidable offensive strategic arsenal – the cornerstone of which is the SS-18 Satan ICBM, slated to remain in combat service for the next ten or fifteen years.59 However, Russia’s principal ballistic missile of the future is the Topol ICBM, which has recently been deployed.60 The Russian military has created a highly maneuverable variant of this missile, the Topol M, which has MIRV warhead tech­nology. Beyond the Topol M, Russia appears to be continu­ing with the development of the RS-24, which is capable of being equipped with as many as 10 warheads.61 The RS-24 has been successfully tested on several occasions.62 The Rus­sian navy has also continued flight tests of its Bulava sea-launched strategic missile system, which has a range of at least 8,000 kilometers and can carry ten or more MIRV war­heads, with varying degrees of success.63 Over the past several years, Russia has substantially al­tered its strategic posture. In late 2003, Russia unveiled a new military doctrine lowering the bar on the use of nu­clear force to protect Russian interests in its “near abroad” of Central Asia and the Caucasus.64 Then-President Vladi­mir Putin announced the end of Russian force reductions and launched massive exercises of the country’s strategic forces.65 Russia has also announced that it will discontin­ue missile-launch notifications to other signatories of the Hague Code of Conduct on missile proliferation. Moscow and Beijing have held joint military exercises on one anoth­er’s territory and continue to strengthen military ties with other countries in the region, by way of the Shanghai Coop­eration Organization.66 These steps are seen by Moscow as a hedge against Western encroachment into countries on its periphery and a means to blunt the emerging American missile defense system. These trends are likely to continue under the Medvedev administration, as power in Russia ap­pears to have shifted to the prime minister’s office, now oc­cupied by Putin. The Dangers This itemized list of advances in ballistic missile capabil­ities in recent years, if viewed individually, might still un­derstate the dangers to the United States and its allies. The proliferation of ballistic missile capabilities by potential enemies, both states and non-state actors, must be viewed more broadly. It carries with it the implication that America and its allies may face coalitions of missile powers as addi­tional states acquire such capabilities. For example, Russia or China could decide to back North Korea in a confronta­tion with South Korea, Japan, and the United States. Like­wise, U.S. allies may drop out in the face of such a combined threat stemming from enemy coalitions whose members are armed with ballistic missiles, thus possibly confronting the United States with the larger missile threat presented by such a combination of missile possessors. Furthermore, in an emerging multi-polar world where ballistic missile and nuclear proliferation create an increasingly complex coali­tion dynamic, the unpredictability factor increases dramat­ically and must be addressed. The analogy of two scorpions in a bottle that characterized the U.S.-Soviet confrontation in the Cold War is giving way to multiple scorpions in a bot­tle, with all the complexity, unpredictability, and danger that this possibility implies. </span>__Asymmetric Threats__ __Asymmetric threats by rogue states and strategic compet­itors pose growing and compounding dangers to the Unit­ed States and its allies. WMD Terrorism An increasing number of terrorist groups are making con­certed efforts to acquire WMD.67__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As long ago as 1994, ists affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Jihad Organization made a serious bid to buy an atomic bomb or fissile material from one of Russia’s crumbling “nuclear cities.”68 More recently, the 9/11 Commission explicitly warned that </span>__“**Al-Qaeda remains extremely interested in conducting** chemical, **biologica**l, ra­diological, **or nuclear attacks**.”__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">69 After the March 2003 arrest of 9/11 mastermind Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, investiga­tions revealed that terrorists had obtained materials for pro­ducing botulinum and salmonella toxins and cyanide.70 Lebanon’s Hezbollah has also acquired menacing capa­bilities that were put on display during the 34-day war be­tween the Shiite militia and the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006 days of the war, when Hezbollah should have been weakened by Israel’s sustained military operations, mi­litiamen launched more rockets into Israel than at any oth­er. During the course of the conflict, Hezbollah man­aged to launch over 4,000 of its estimated 13,000 rockets into northern Israel.71 Particularly troubling is the fact that in the final time during the conflict, striking as deep into Israeli ter­ritory as Haifa. Since the 2006 war, Hezbollah has rearmed both quan­titatively and qualitatively, and Hezbollah Secretary Gen­eral Hassan Nasrallah has claimed that the group’s arsenal now includes rockets that can target anywhere in Israel. A 2007 United Nations report concludes that Hezbollah may now have as many as 10,000 long-range rockets and 20,000 short-range rockets.72 United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has suggested that Hezbollah is now capable of striking Israel’s main metropolis, Tel Aviv, and that the mi­litia has tripled its stockpile of C-802 land-to-sea missiles. The addition of longer-range missiles significantly challeng­es efforts to counter Hezbollah’s capabilities. As part of the ceasefire agreement that ended the hostilities in 2006, the Lebanese army and the United Nations Interim Force in Leb­ anon (UNIFIL) have assumed much greater responsibilities in disrupting Hezbollah activities south of the Litani River. In response, Hezbollah has simply moved many of its long-range missile launchers north of the Litani into areas of the Bekaa Valley where neither the Lebanese army nor UNIFIL patrol. Even in southern Lebanon, where the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL are ostensibly providing security, Hezbollah has been successful in rearming with anti-tank missiles and Katyusha rockets hidden in villages and camouflaged bun­kers, according to the Israel Defense Force (IDF).</span>__73__ __The Ship-borne Scud Threat__ __Among the threats outlined in the 1998 Rumsfeld Commis­sion Report is the one posed by ballistic missiles launched from vessels such as freighters, tankers, or container ships close to the American coastline. Such a danger has only in­creased in the past decade. In August 2004, then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized that “One of the nations in the Middle East had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> They had taken a short-range, probably Scud missile, put it on a transporter-erector launcher, lowered it in, tak­en the vessel out into the water, peeled back the top, erect­ed it, fired it, lowered it, covered it up. And the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50, 60, 100 other ships operating in the im­mediate area.”74 U.S. officials have suggested that Rumsfeld was referring to Iran, which tested a ship-launched missile in the late 1990s.75 This ship-borne ballistic capability could be used to launch EMP attacks from locations off the U.S. coastline with devastating effects (more below). Asymmetric Proliferation In 2002, writing in the Financial Times, Defense Science Board chairman William Schneider described the mechan­ics by which North Korea has managed to acquire nuclear capabilities as the quintessential “twenty-first century tem­plate for proliferation.” </span>__The rapid, clandestine acquisition of critical mass in Pyongyang’s nuclear program, according to Schneider, reflects the existence of a vibrant, and self-sus­taining, proliferation architecture in today’s internation­al system.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">76 Schneider was referring to what has now been deemed “second-tier proliferation,” whereby “states in the developing world with varying technical capabilities trade among themselves to bolster one another’s nuclear and stra­tegic weapons efforts.”77 North Korea is a prime example of this trend. The devel­opment of the Al-Kibar reactor in Syria, destroyed by an Is­raeli airstrike in September 2007, is believed to have been greatly aided by North Korea. In fact, North Korea went so far as to send personnel to help construct the reactor. Be­yond its nuclear proliferation efforts, the Kim Jong-Il regime has become a principal supplier of ballistic missile compo­nents and associated technologies to the Middle East. The Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) estimates that North Korea has exported more than 1,000 Scud missiles along with mis­sile-related parts to the Middle East region. Missile exports, which net North Korea around $1.5 billion a year, constitute one of its largest sources of revenue. North Korea has since expanded this trade, and is now believed to be offering tech­nologies associated with its advanced Taepo Dong 2 ICBM to a number of regional client states, including Syria and Iran.78 Moreover, North Korea has sold missiles to Pakistan in exchange for nuclear technologies,a trade facilitated in large part by A.Q. Khan’s proliferation network (see below for more on A.Q. Khan).79 China has also used the transfer of nuclear and ballistic missile technologies as a tool of global influence and a mon­ey-making enterprise. Extensive Chinese assistance has been instrumental to North Korea’s development of the Taepo Dong 2, and it has played a central role in Pakistan’s development of nuclear capabilities. This cooperation has led to a trilater­al “proliferation axis” that has given Pakistan access to North Korean ballistic missiles and allowed Pakistani nuclear know-how to flow to North Korea.80 Chinese defense companies have also been complicit in aiding Iran’s progress on ballistic missile technology. The United States responded by impos­ing penalties on these companies for exporting to Iran highperformance metals and other components that can be used to extend the range of Tehran’s missile arsenal.81 Furthermore, such activities are not confined to state ac­tors. In late 2003, the discovery of the clandestine nucle­ar cartel headed by Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan exposed an alarming web of WMD and ballistic missile prolifera­tion. Khan confessed that he had provided Libya, Iran, and North Korea with technical assistance and components for manufacturing high-speed centrifuges.82 The government of Pakistan also revealed that he “gave some centrifuges to Iran,” and U.S. intelligence officials believe that North Ko­rea purchased high-speed centrifuges from the Khan net­work.83 Perhaps most troubling was the discovery of a nu­clear weapon design in 2008 on the computer hard drives of several members of Khan’s network.84 The bomb design is a miniaturized implosion device cable of fitting on North Korea’s No Dong missiles, as well as Iran’s Shahab and Pak­istan’s Hatf-5 (Ghauri) missiles. Depending on how much the design allows for warhead size reduction, these coun­tries may be able to make significant advances in their MIRV warhead programs. The EMP Threat According to the 2004 report of the EMP Commission,85 </span>**__the U__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__faces a threat from EMP that could have cata­strophic consequences based on even a single nuclear war­head__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. EMP is generated by any nuclear weapon burst at any altitude above a few dozen kilometers, with the height of</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">burst being significant in determining the area exposed to EMP. </span><span class="A7">__<span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif;">The EMP threat arises from the ability, whether by ter­rorists or states, to launch relatively unsophisticated mis­siles with nuclear warheads to detonate at altitudes</span>__</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;"> from 40 to 400 kilometers </span><span class="A7">__<span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif;">above the earth’s surface</span>__</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The rationale for such action would be the high political-military payoff in the form of devastating consequences. An EMP attack would constitute a highly successful asymmetric strategy against a society as heavily dependent as the United States is on electronics, energy, telecommunications networks, transportation systems, the movement of inventories in its manufacturing sector, and food processing and distribution capabilities. As noted in the EMP Commission report, EMP was an unintended result of a nuclear detonation at an al­titude of about 400 kilometers during the Starfish nuclear weapons tests above Johnstone Island in the Central Pacif­ic in 1962. The effects, felt some 1400 kilometers away in Ha­waii, included “the failure of street lighting systems, tripping of circuit breakers, triggering of burglar alarms, and damage to a telecommunications relay facility.” Nuclear tests con­ducted by the Soviet Union, also in 1962, produced damage to overhead and underground buried cables at distances as far away as 600 kilometers, together with surge arrest­er burnout, spark-gap breakdown, blown fuses, and power-supply breakdown.</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">86 </span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">The destruction and mayhem caused by an EMP explosion would be far more substantial today given the ubiquity of electronics and society’s increased re­liance on them to run critical infrastructures. </span>__Several potential enemies__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> either </span>__already have__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, or could soon acquire, </span>__the capability to attack the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates with a high-altitude nuclear explosion EMP that would cover a wide geographic region.

U.S. </span>__satellites, both civilian and military, are vulnerable to__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> a range of at­tacks that include </span>__EMP__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, especially in low-earth orbits. Again, as the EMP Commission concluded, “The national security and homeland security communities use commercial satel­lites for critical activities, including direct and backup com­munications, emergency response services, and continuity of operations during emergencies.”</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">87 </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Such satellites could </span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">be disabled by collateral radiation effects from an EMP at­tack on ground targets. </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Thus it is obvious that an interdependence exists between the objects of a potential EMP attack. </span>__Disabling one of the infrastructures, such as telecommunications or electricity, would have severe consequences for others, with cascading effects from which an advanced, technologically dependent society such as the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>__might not__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> easily </span>__recover__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. An EMP attack mounted against the United States would have far broader international consequences, given the in­terdependence of America and other economies in an era of globalization. An EMP attack against other economies, such as Japan or a European nation, would have major effects in the United States, and on other countries if the attack was on the United States. The services that would be essential to cope with the consequences of a terrorist attack, such as hospitals and emergency services, themselves might be dis­abled and therefore would not be available when and where they were most needed. As Senator John Kyl has pointed out, “A terrorist organization might have trouble putting a nu­clear warhead ‘on target’ with a Scud, but it would be much easier to simply launch and detonate in the atmosphere. No need for the risk and difficulty trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon over the border or hit a particular city. Just launch a cheap missile from a freighter in international waters – al-Qaeda is believed to own about eighty such vessels – and make sure to get it a few miles in the air.”</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">88</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Notably, Russia has considered attack options that in­clude EMP. During the May 1999 NATO air campaign against Serbia, members of the Russian Duma, meeting with U.S. congressional counterparts, reportedly speculated about the paralyzing effects of an EMP attack on the United States.</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">89 </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">To amplify on the Rumsfeld statement cited under “Ship-borne Scud Threat,” above, Iran is reported to have tested whether its ballistic missiles, such as the Shahab-3 or the Scud, could be detonated by remote control while still in high-altitude flight. The most plausible explanation for such tests is that Iran is developing the capability to explode a high-altitude nuclear weapon that could destroy critical electronic and technological infrastructures.</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">90 </span>**__Without an<span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif;"> effective missile defense the U</span>__**<span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span class="A7">**__<span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif;">S</span>__**</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span class="A7">**__<span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif;">will remain vul­nerable to the EMP threat given its extensive dependence on high-tech, electronic infrastructure that cannot easily be hardened to withstand such an attack</span>__**</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. The ability to launch an incapacitating EMP strike against the United States pro­vides enemies with an asymmetric threat that would not only inhibit U.S. military action but would also strike a se­vere economic and psychological blow.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Response</span>__Given this multiplicity of ballistic missile threats, the Unit­ed States must deploy a missile defense that deters hostile states from developing or acquiring missile capabilities that could threaten the United States, its allies and coalition part­ners, and its forces deployed abroad. Furthermore, America’s missile defense R&D programs, together with planned de­ployments, must be sufficiently robust to dissuade would-be missile possessors from attempting to challenge the United States. Washington must deter future enemies from acquir­ing ballistic missiles, just as in the past it dissuaded them from developing strategic bombers because of America’s abil­ity to overwhelm such systems. Finally, U.S. missile defense must be capable of defeating those ballistic missiles, what­ever their range and type, that could be launched against the United States. U.S. and allied ballistic missile defense capabilities are an essential element of a broader damage limitation strat­egy.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The purpose of this strategy is to protect and defend the people, territory, infrastructure, and institutions of the United States and its allies to the greatest extent possible. </span>__This strategy is a marked departure from the retaliation-based deterrence strategy of the Cold War. It is a strategy specifically tailored to meeting the security demands result­ing from the emerging multi-polar world, which has been brought about, at least in part, by the proliferation of bal­listic missiles and nuclear weapons. A mix of offensive and defensive strategic forces, which are modernized to meet the new and challenging requirements of this strategy, will be necessary.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Thus, a global and layered ballistic missile de­fense system must be intricately linked to other strategic forces, where the broader strategic posture of the U.S. and its allies results in security benefits that are greater than the sum of its parts. </span>__As the United States dissuades future potential possess­ors, it must recognize that threats are increasing at a pace that no longer allows the luxury of long lead times within which a missile defense could be developed and deployed. Therefore**, the U**nited **S**tates **must develop and rapidly field** a **missile defense with global reach, capable of coping with threats** against the United States and its forces and allies from any direction. At the same time, America must attempt to dissuade hostile actors from acquiring missiles by render­ing such investments a poor use of limited resources__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Ad­ditionally, given the uncertainty in predicting where, when, and by whom missiles might be launched – and what their targets may be – constant defenses are called for that are capable of intercepting missiles irrespective of their geo­graphic origin. Other things being equal, it is preferable to intercept threatening ballistic missiles as far away from their intend­ed targets and as early in their flight trajectory as possible. Best of all would be to have the capability to destroy an at­tacking missile shortly after it is launched, while its rockets still burn and any perturbation will lead to its destruction – with, in many cases, the debris falling back onto the area from which the attack was launched in the first place. </span>**__The ca­pability to interdict a missile and its warheads in any phases__** **__of their flight__** __(boost, midcourse, and terminal) **requires an ability to detect** and intercept **the attack within a very few minutes and to track and destroy the attacking missile and its warheads during their longer midcourse traverse through space** before they reenter the atmosphere__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Finally, the last-ditch defense would be to destroy the attacking missiles as they reenter and pass through the atmosphere – and as ac­companying debris and decoys burn up on reentry – in the terminal phase en route to their targets. </span>**__The best defense ca­pability would be layered so that it could provide opportuni­ties for destruction in all three phases__** __of flight__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Only space-based defenses inherently have this global capability and permanence. While sea-based defenses can move freely through the two-thirds of the earth’s surface that are oceans, their capability is limited by geography and by the specific operations of the fleet – including where the sea-based missile defense happens to be deployed at any given time, and how quickly it could be redeployed to meet a crisis situation. Air-based and ground-based defenses, meanwhile, can have global capabilities, but frequently take considerable time to deploy when and where needed and are also depen­dent on the cooperation of U.S. friends and allies in permit­ting the necessary supporting activities on their territories. Thus, only a space-based missile defense will possess both constancy and global availability, irrespective of allied sup­port and agreement. As such, space-based missile defense constitutes the only truly global system, with all the rest be­ing either regional or local.</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">91</span>__In the case of **sea-based systems**, namely the Aegis pro­gram discussed in section 2, we have a regional system **ca­pable of boost-phase, midcourse, and terminal intercept** de­pending on where and how it is positioned, or vectored. It **has a near-global application** for regional operations, **be­cause it is** sea-based and theoretically **it can be deployed over any portion of the earth’s surface covered by oceans**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. A land-based system can theoretically be deployed anywhere over about one-third of the world’s surface and, depending on how it is vectored, under some limited conditions would also be capable of boost-phase, midcourse, and terminal in­terception. Yet space-based missile defense alone is truly global in reach because of the medium in which it oper­ates, unconstrained by overflight or territorial restrictions. It also offers inherent interdiction advantages, described in greater detail below.</span>

Bioweapons cause extinction
**__Ochs ‘2__**<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (Richard Ochs, "BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS MUST BE ABOLISHED IMMEDIATELY", 6-9-2002, [[http://www.freefromterror.net/other_articles/abolish.html]])</span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The failure of the FBI to prosecute the perpetrator of the anthrax letters even though the FBI is believed to know who it is has led several experts to conclude that the perpetrator is untouchable because he has knowledge damaging to the government. That knowledge is believed to be the US violation of the 1972 Convention on Biological Weapons, which states that it is illegal to "develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire" such weapons. The US is using state-of-the-art genetic splicing to make designer bioweapons. An article by Laura Rozen in Salon (2/8/02) revealed that the "Defense Intelligence Agency hired Battelle to create a genetically enhanced version of anthrax" even though no vaccine was proven to be effective beforehand. A former Clinton administration official, Elisa D. Harris, "was shocked to read in the New York Times" (9/4/01) about bioweapons research "that she herself had not known about, although she had served for eight years in the White House as the point person for weapons of mass destruction nonproliferation issues."What other secret, illegal and genetically modified bioweapons are in the works? If we are told "none," why should we believe anything they tell us? </span>**__Of all the weapons of mass destruction__**__, the genetically engineered **biological weapons**, many without a known cure or vaccine, **are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a "nuclear winter," resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons,**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> on the other hand, </span>**__can get out of control very easily__****__, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions__**__. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause.__ <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. Potentially worse than that, </span>**__bio-engineered agents__** <span style="font-size: 7pt;">by the hundreds with no known cure</span> __**could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation**.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? </span>**__HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Ironically, the Bush administration has just changed the U.S. nuclear doctrine to allow nuclear retaliation against threats upon allies by conventional weapons. The past doctrine allowed such use only as a last resort when our nation’s survival was at stake. Will the new policy also allow easier use of US bioweapons? How slippery is this slope? Against this tendency can be posed a rational alternative policy.</span>__To preclude possibilities of human extinction, "patriotism" needs to be redefined to make humanity’s survival primary and absolute. Even if we lose our cherished freedom, our sovereignty, our government or our Constitution, where there is life, there is hope. What good is anything else if humanity is extinguished?__ <span style="font-size: 7pt;">This concept should be promoted to the center of national debate. For example, for sake of argument, suppose the ancient Israelites developed defensive bioweapons of mass destruction when they were enslaved by Egypt. Then suppose these weapons were released by design or accident and wiped everybody out? </span>__As bad as slavery is, extinction is worse__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Our generation, our century, our epoch needs to take the long view. We truly hold in our hands the precious gift of all future life. Empires may come and go, but who are the honored custodians of life on earth? Temporal politicians? Corporate competitors? Strategic brinksmen? Military gamers? Inflated egos dripping with testosterone? How can any sane person believe that national sovereignty is more important than survival of the species? Now that extinction is possible, our slogan should be "Where there is life, there is hope." No government, no economic system, no national pride, no religion, no political system can be placed above human survival. The egos of leaders must not blind us. </span>

So understanding the reality in the middle there is extremely important in order to not only deter the use of ballistic missiles, but start to get into affecting the strategies that an adversary would use in their earlier calculations of do they even want to invest their precious resources into arsenals of missiles__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Then I believe we have absolutely used missile defense in its greatest role. First of all </span>__from a point of view of practicality, it is not a shield__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Missile defense is not being built in a way that there is an absolute agreement, or there's an absolute concurrence that the missiles that are being shot, large attacks, hundreds of missiles, let's say, from a short range point of view which is very capable, it's very conceivable today. Would missile defense be able to negate all of those effects? No. Do I believe it in the future? No. I do believe there's a practical reality to, </span>__there will be some threats coming through, and I hear this discussion of building shields. I do believe that is not beneficial to have that point of view__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__On the other hand, there are great capabilities that it can have and it **can definitely cause an opponent** or adversary **not to be successful in achieving their military** objectives **or** even their **geopolitical objectives**, and there's a case where I believe missile defense does have a direct application__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, but it must be done in a specific way. </span>**__Missile defense__** __is not so much a deterrence against strategic threats as it **is an effective way to prevent escalation of wars** and other conflicts in order that it grows to be a strategic, **to a strategic context** of warfare. So **it is very effective**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, I believe, </span>**__in preventing escalation of lower level conflicts into__** __what we would call **higher level conflicts**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. So there are some fundamentals, though, and I'd like to discuss those in the next couple of charts. First of all, again, quoting our distinguished lunch-time speaker here today, Dr. Schlesinger, back in 2008 a point that he made that rings through with my agency is the fact that the psychological and political objectives of deterring opponents and reassuring allies are really built on the precepts that you have a physical and credible deterrence against the use of ballistic missiles in our case. Now I don't want to put Dr. Schlesinger on the spot, but I know there's a lot of discussion of cyber and so I'm not going to get into physical and non-physical from that aspect, but I think that this is the appropriate conference. But from the case of missile defense, we are looking at tangible, something tangible that an adversary can see, and communicates across cultures, across levels of understanding and it becomes very effective in the realm of deterrence. Next chart. </span>__A basic fundamental__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, as I said, </span>__about missile defense is **it's not a foolproof shield. But the more layers you add, the much better effectiveness you have**. That goes without denying__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. And so number one, </span>**__there is not one single system__** __out there **that would provide** the type of **protection** that__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> I think </span>__any of us would be satisfied with. **But when you combine systems you get to a very high level of protection**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As Roger was saying earlier, Roger Burg, our estimates of these precise numbers, we're not there yet. We have a lot of testing to do in the future before we can accredit our models and simulations and have a lot of confidence. But one thing we do know is </span>**__there is an extensive amount of capability available and it becomes very difficult to counter a missile defense system that is deploying several different layers of defense and takes several opportunities for an intercept__** __of an incoming missile__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and has the ability to handle rate sizes, has the ability to have preferential defense over some assets over others that it's trying to defend, </span>**__and it gives you a very effective military capability__** __when deployed in layers__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Primarily our ICBM defense today, </span>**__the ground-based mid-course defense system__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, is a defense system being established against a first generation of ICBMs or perhaps a second generation. That's what we're building the capability for today so that there </span>__is credible deterrence in the area of someone going to launch a first or second generation ICBM__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. I can talk more about that in questions. </span>__The next layer__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, though, </span>__is the area that's growing the most__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. That is in </span>__our medium range and intermediate range threats__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. There were hundreds a few years ago, there are thousands now around the world and not only in numbers, but also in proliferation of launchers, so rate sizes become more credible. Then </span>__for short range ballistic missile defense__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> you can see the systems here, </span>__both **our lower tier Aegis system and our Patriot system and our THAAD system** that works in both is being developed__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__So when we test and when we do our war games and our exercises, we do that to a greater extent now in **integrating these** systems **together**. It's the integration which **is the key to having an effective missile defense**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As you can see, some of our futuristic capability we're developing now such as Aegis Ashore, which lends to a more semi-permanent type commitment or defense in areas around the world. Next chart. What I believe is most beneficial in the area of deterrence is first having credible capability. Realistic, more challenging flight tests. We had a failure in our GMD system last year, earlier this year, but we were testing for the first time against a threat from 8,000 kilometers away, rather than 3500 which we had had many successes at. So the more success they have, the more we're going to challenge the system. We're looking at how we can improve the system. Nineteen of 22 intercepts since four years ago, about four years ago this time. And the numbers keep increasing with our success, but one thing that's not in the statistic is we go after much more difficult intercept attempts every time we do test. Credible capacity. That isn't discussed, I believe, or understood enough in the areas of missile defense. We demonstrate capability against one or two missiles in the air at once, but as I said, the threat is growing today where it's very reasonable to assume 50 to 100 missiles could be launched at you at any one time, especially in the short range category. We must have the ability to intercept that many missiles in the air at once and with a shot doctrine, let's just say, of two interceptors against every missile that means in a region if you're threatened by 100 missiles you obviously have to have at least 200 interceptors deployed in the local area. So that's a capacity. Our government is addressing that issue in our upcoming budgets, and the requests and demands from our warfighting commanders for the Missile Defense Agency and Department of Defense, is to provide that capacity. But what goes along with that also is mobility. We obviously can't build thousands and thousands and thousands of interceptors to cover the globe, but what you can do is what we do with the rest of our precious defense resources is have mobility and the ability to surge. But the next point is very critical. If we're going to surge into an area, the nature of missile defense, the way one country can threaten non-contiguous countries often over great distances, we must rely on an international network to have not only utilizing their capability but also frankly their access and their real estate and their geometries that they allow us to effectively have missile defense. That means our command and control networks need to be established now so that we can practice and do wargames and exercises. Also demonstrating our commitment to extended deterrence in this realm. Demonstrated operations is the next step after you have the networks in place and the agreements. We need to have a greater demonstration of missile defense capability in our operations. If you look at our allied wargames and exercises the number is increasing significantly over the last ten years. Finally, enduring commitment. Aegis Ashore, as I mentioned before, that's where you take the Aegis system, a very effective system we have shown short range. We're moving into the realm at this point in time of medium and intermediate range capability testing with Aegis. But moving it to a location where it provides the basis and an anchor for that framework that we can surge the rest of our capability around underscores the credibility, not only capability but capacity. The next chart just gives a quick snapshot, I won't go through all of this, but it just shows those international wargames and exercises which emphasize and exercise our ability to conduct missile defense operations with our friends and allies on an international basis. Next chart. Finally, I just want to say, as I said in the beginning, I believe deterrence does require a demonstration of capability and also our ability to have the type of analysis that Roger was referring to before with nuclear deterrence in the past. We must anchor our models and simulations with empirical data to give us greater confidence. We can make judgments. I'm not saying -- To me, a goal of this would be within plus or minus ten percent. I would be extremely happy with that. And that's what the test program that you see across the board here. So I'll leave my opening comments from the fact </span>**__we are not only committed to developing missile defense, but demonstrating it in a way that allows it to be an instrument of deterrence__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Thank you.</span>

The NSP signaled benign intent in space development, but political controversy and residual global uncertainty over its implementation continue to deny effective multilateral cooperation on space security
**__Huntley ‘11__** (Wade L. Huntley, Ph.D., senior lecturer in the National Security Affairs department at the Naval Postgraduate School, “The 2011 U.S. National Space Security Policy: Engagement as a Work in Progress,” Disarmament Times, Spring 2011, http://disarm.igc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=429:the-2011-us-national-space-security-policy-engagement-as-a-work-in-progress&catid=154:disarmament-times-spring-2011&Itemid=2)
**__U.S. space policy__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in the two decades since the end of the Cold War </span>**__has been evolving against a backdrop of uncertainty__**__. Technological developments shape and redistribute power resources relevant to space security activities, and **game-changing advances in space technologies could emerge at any time**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Also, space activities involve an increasing number and variety of actors. Whereas states have been dominant in the past, recent trends suggest an increasing trend toward privatization of space activities, with private launches and space tourism on the horizon. While the same context influences many other countries as well, </span>__the central role of U.S. space activities on the global stage generates particular attention. This is especially true of U.S. policies and activities regarding military security in space. The U.S. space security position is widely understood to be world dominant, and so U.S. behavior naturally overshadows and shapes the behavior of others. U.S. behavior, however, does not necessarily “set the tone.” Rather, the reactions of other countries and non-state actors to the directions of U.S. policies and activities are inevitably filtered through their own outlooks. **Although cooperative and multilateral tacks in U.S. government policies generally have a palliative effect on the global atmosphere, U.S. policy-makers do not characteristically assume that cooperative gestures will routinely elicit quid pro quo responses**. **That additional uncertainty underlies** **the ongoing tension between “nationalist” and “internationalist” impulses in U.S. policy-making on space**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (as on many other issues) </span>**__and in turn magnifies global uncertainties concerning the future of space governance__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. During the Cold War, national security concerns dominated U.S. space activities. While manned missions and commercial opportunities occupied prominent positions in the public image, with NASA becoming the “face” of the U.S. space posture, activities from Sputnik onward were inspired by — and funding for them justified by — the underlying security competition with the Soviet Union. Importantly for current circumstances, this Cold War posture became entrenched in core attitudes and bureaucratic practices across much of the space community. As a result, </span>__even as Cold War ended, U.S. space policy could not easily diverge from its focus on national security__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For example, the 1996 National Space Policy issued by the Clinton administration, while envisioning greater “partnership and cooperation” internationally, aimed to maintain a U.S. “leadership role” across the full range of space activities. Guidelines for security activities in space were prominent, and while these guidelines included provisions for arms control as well as expressly military activities, the policy less effectively explained how tensions in these aims would be reconciled.1 Moreover, the overarching tone of the policy was to view U.S. space activities as derivative of broader national goals, rather than constituting national goals in themselves, continuing a trend since the end of the Apollo missions. As is well understood, </span>__the space policies of the Bush administration were decidedly oriented toward military security concerns and independent action__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The 2006 National Space Policy unabashedly proclaimed the U.S. intention to maintain a dominant position in space indefinitely. This policy orientation dismissed multilateral cooperation as impinging on U.S. “freedom of action,” throwing weight instead behind a wide range of technology development initiatives founded on the assumption that deployment of weapons in space was, if not already factual, certainly inevitable.2 U.S. commercial and civil engagement was overshadowed by these security concerns, expressed through the tightening of export control restrictions inhibiting a broad range of technology sharing. Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns. </span>__This background is essential for appreciating how the space policies of the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails. **The** U.S. **N**ational **S**pace **P**olicy issued in June 2010 **has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone**, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3 Less broadly noticed was this policy’s clarity and coherence in articulating a vision for U.S. space activities on its own terms. The document is organized around core principles, subsidiary goals and implementing guidelines that exceed its predecessors in delineating a longer-term direction for U.S. space policy that is integrated with, rather than derivative of, broader U.S. global aims.4 The policy also was generated and issued far earlier in the tenure of the administration than either of its predecessors, indicating an increased prioritization of attention to space policy at higher levels of policy-making. To some degree, a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, new budget realities and unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds. The 2011 National Security Space Strategy, released February 4, is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation and greater attention to space policy in general. This first-of-its-kind strategic statement culminates a congressionally mandated space posture review.6 The initial section portraying the strategic environment to which U.S. security policy must be responsive highlights the growing problems of space debris, orbital congestion and coordination among a growing number of space actors — not state-based security threats per se. The Security Space Strategy features the objective of a “stable space environment in which nations exercise shared responsibility.”7 Specific provisions intended to implement this strategy, relevant to the preceding observations, include:8 • The strategy presents a full section on “Partnering with Responsible Nations, International Organizations, and Commercial Firms.” This category is not wholly multilateral in the traditional sense, displaying a symbiosis of alliance-building and collective cooperation not always carefully distinguished; i.e., “The United States will lead in building coalitions of like-minded space-faring nations and, where appropriate, work with international institutions to do so.” • The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and norms of behavior for responsible space operations.” [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements in the longer-term. • The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships,” and to “expand provision of safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right. • The strategy commits to reforming export controls. “In particular, as new opportunities arise for international collaboration, a revised export control system will better enable the domestic firms competing for these contracts.” As noted above, the oppressive impact of current U.S. export controls not only impinges on U.S. commercial space actors but also epitomizes the high degree to which U.S. policy has subsumed commercial and civil interests to national security concerns. The strategy appears to acknowledge this connection and commit to remedy it. • The most assertive passages of the statement are moderated with community-building intent. For example, the strategy’s section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression” concludes that the U.S. “will retain the right and capabilities to respond in self-defense, should deterrence fail,” but immediately adds that the U.S. “will use force in a manner that is consistent with longstanding principles of international law, treaties to which the United States is a party, and the inherent right of self defense.” • The concluding and most conflict-oriented section of the strategy opens by noting that “some actors may still believe counterspace actions could provide military advantage.” Counterspace capabilities, unarticulated in the document, include ASATs, ground-based directed energy weapons and satellite transmission jamming. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Gregory Schulte explained at the strategy’s rollout that China is a principal concern in this regard, but so is the proliferation of these technologies: “If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry what others can do.”10 This section of the strategy does not, however, call for maintaining options to develop complementary space conflict capabilities. Rather, the strategy asserts that the U.S. “must be prepared to ‘fight through’ a degraded environment,” and identifies “resilience” and “space protection” as the key criteria. The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps as striking as the prevalence of such passages, however, is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand the kind of independent space-based military capabilities that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 </span>__The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative </span>__“as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. </span>**__These policy movements toward multilateral engagement__** __and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) **mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 </span>__Critics also decried the strategy’s emphasis on “the old fallacious assumption that the power of example will prevent adversaries from doing the United States harm,” and endorsed maintaining the goal of U.S. retention of a “dominant position in military and intelligence space capabilities.”__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">15 In fact, the administration’s warming toward normative commitments in general — and the EU Code of Conduct in particular — are in part intended to forestall pressure for more formal and binding measures that would definitively cut off the “hedge” of unilateral U.S. weapons development options.16 </span>**__The balance of U.S. debate may have shifted toward greater international cooperation, but the terms of the debate remain the same__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In sum, the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also, and more importantly, a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 </span>__But if this reading is sound, **the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that </span>__more **specific guidelines for military implementation** of the strategy **remain to be developed**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.18 </span>**__Many devils may lurk in these details__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>


Specifically, the NSP rhetorically committed to hosted military payloads, but it won’t be implemented for a decade
**__Hudson ‘11__** (Katie Hudson, “National Security Space Strategy Brings Opportunity for Hosted Payloads,” Hosted Payloads: presented by Space News, 2-7-2011, http://www.hostedpayload.com/blog/national-security-space-strategy-brings-opportunity-for-hosted-payloads)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Last Friday, the U.S. Defense Department released the new National Security Space Strategy. The decade long policy is meant to help direct the U.S. Government in terms of Obama’s National Space Policy. Deputy Defense Secretary, Gregory Schulte said this policy is aimed at making the United States "more resilient" and capable of protecting its holdings in an increasingly trafficked and at times hostile setting. </span>**__In the N__**__ational **S**pace **P**olicy__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, announced in June 2010, </span>**__an emphasis was put on the “reliance on commercial space activities” including “hosting government payloads on commercial spacecraft__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and purchasing of data products.” Schute also mentioned that </span>__U.S. Defense Department officials are working with Australia on sharing space situational awareness and are figuring out how the DoD can host payloads on their satellites. “And we’re looking for a whole range of activities to implement the new strategy in a budget-constrained environment__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">,” he said. In an article on MSNBC.com, it was mentioned that </span>__both the National Security Space Strategy and the National Space Policy reflect a policy shift in response to space security. There is now a focus on the threats of anti-satellite weapons and the growing amount of space debris. We are also in a time where there are almost 60 different commercial companies or countries that own or operate assets in space__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__Both the Space Policy and the Security Strategy come at an important time in the space world. Given tight budgets, and possibly even tighter budgets in the future, international cooperation will be helpful__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In the MSNBC.com article, Schulte stated that </span>**__the D__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">epartment </span>**__o__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">f </span>**__D__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">efense </span>**__has begun talking about hosting payloads on commercial satellites__** __in the "budget-constrained environment__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">." </span>**__The policy is not expected to be actually implemented for another ten years__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. By then, will the threat of space debris become a crisis? Having multiple payloads on board a satellite would help decrease the amount of debris down the line, but the question remains:How soon till a policy is actually implemented?</span>


That’s because they’re restricted to experimental missions – Congressional action is key
**__Selding ‘11__** (Peter B. de Selding, “CHIRP Delay Holds Lessons for U.S. Air Force, Industry,” Space News, 9-12-2011, http://www.spacenews.com/military/110912-chirp-delay-lessons-af-industry.html)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">In a presentation here Sept. 12 at the World Satellite Business Week conference, Kathy Shockey, vice president of research and business development at commercial satellite builder Space Systems/Loral of Palo Alto, Calif., said Loral estimates that nine commercial telecommunications satellites per year built by U.S. and European manufacturers could be made available for hosted payloads seeking a ride to geostationary orbit 36,000 kilometers over the equator. Burgess cautioned that </span>**__most commercial__** __telecommunications **satellites are designed to be able to launch on at least two of the world’s principal commercial rockets**. The two dominant commercial launch providers now are Evry, France-based **Arianespace and** International Launch Services (**ILS**) of McLean, Va. ILS is owned by the Russian government-controlled Khrunichev Space Center of Moscow, which builds the Russian Proton heavy-lift **rockets** marketed worldwide by ILS__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Burgess said </span>**__the Air Force accepted CHIRP’s__** __**launch aboard a European rocket, but would have hesitated before permitting** its **launch** aboard an ILS Proton vehicle, which is operated **from Russia**’s Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Loverro said that with a little extra effort, the Air Force CHIRP team might have secured U.S. Air Force approval for an ILS Proton launch as well. But he added: “It would not have been our first choice.” </span>**__Current U.S. government policy permits U.S. government payloads to launch on non-U.S. rockets only if the payloads are experimental in nature__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, as is CHIRP. Loverro said </span>__the next step will be to secure a decision to allow operational payloads to use non-U.S. rockets__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In a statement issued Sept. 14, the Air For Space and Missile Systems Center said, “</span>__[t]he policy currently in place is limited to military experimental hosted payloads and in the future **there will have to be a Congressional campaign to allow** operational **hosted payloads on a foreign** U.S. **launcher for commercial opportunities**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. “This does not address all U.S. government experimental payloads. </span>__The new, much anticipated **Arianespace launch with** **the first U.S. commercially hosted payload is the beginning of a new way of ridesharing to space**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">,” the statement concludes. </span>**__In recent years, U.S.-built rockets have been virtually absent from the commercial launch landscape because of their price and__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> what some satellite owners view as their </span>**__lack of availability__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>


The plan is essential to move beyond the lip service of the NSP – creates a formal procurement mechanism and standardizes technical interfaces
**__Rhodes ‘11__** (Rhodes Communications, “To Catch a Moving Train,” Space News International, 5-2-2011, http://rhodescomm.com/_literature_102214/To_Catch_a_Moving_Train)
**__The U.S. Defense Department's fast-fading opportunity to piggyback a military mission aboard__** __Iridium Communications‘ **next-generation satellite constellation underscores the need for a formal mechanism** and procedures **by which government agencies, the Pentagon in particular, can identify and capitalize on brewing hosted payload opportunities**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Perhaps the biggest challenge associated with hosted payloads is that government and commercial entities operate on different time scales. Commercial satellite operators, for whom time is money, set and largely adhere to tight schedules for deploying new capabilities. Large government bureaucracies, on the other hand, barring a genuine emergency can rarely muster a relatively simple investment decision within the narrow opening that a commercial development program offers. Since few commercial satellite operators can afford to put manufacturing programs on hold while awaiting a government commitment to get on board never mind the arrival of an integration-ready payload — it's likely that most such opportunities will be missed. Iridium, for example, must replace a constellation of some 66 low-orbiting satellites that were launched mainly in the late l990s. An independent analysis has determined that the current Iridium ﬂeet should last until 2017 or so, which puts the company on a relatively tight schedule forgetting the Iridium Next replacement constellation built, launched aboard multiple rockets and then checked out on orbit. Iridium has long made clear that hosting government payloads is part of the Iridium Next business plan. The company even reserved space and power aboard each of the satellites for hosted payloads, assigning the rights to market that real estate — for a price — to Orbital Sciences Corp. which is under contract to perform ﬁnal assembly and integration of the spacecraft. </span>__The fact that the Pentagon hasn't jumped at the opportunity is not due to a lack of interest__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, according to Iridium Chief Executive Matt Desch, who noted there were ideas for applications that would have taken up a significant portion if not all of the Iridium Next hosted payload capacity. He wasn't specific, but </span>__one could easily envision leveraging the constellation to deploy orbital surveillance or space weather monitoring capabilities with global coverage__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> for a very modest price. </span>**__The problem__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, he said, </span>**__is the Pentagon's massive procurement bureaucracy has yet to adapt to doing business this way__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. "l am afraid </span>**__this is going to be a very big thing in the next I0 years —and not, as it should be, in the next two or three years__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">," he said at a recent conference. It would be easy to criticize the Pentagon for fumbling such a big and rare opportunity — another commercial satellite program of this scale isn't likely to come along for another TD to l5 years, if at all — but it also would be unfair; this was going to be a tough train to catch under any circumstances. Although lridium's plans for hosting govemment payloads have been known for years, it was not until mid-2010 that the company secured the financing to build the satellites and awarded the prime contract to Thales Alenia Space. </span>__Given Iridium's end-of-2012 deadline for securing hosted payload commitments, the Pentagon effectively had some two-and-a-half years to design a program utilizing all or at least a signiﬁcant portion of Iridium Next's capacity, marshal the necessary resources and win approvals across the chain of command and from Congress__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. That's probably asking too much; big govemment bureaucracies simply don't move that quickly. Nr. Desch remains hopeful of selling most of the Iridium Next hosted payload space to other U.S. government customers, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and even the Pentagon could still ﬁnd a way to utilize at least some of the capacity, albeit on a much smaller scale than Iridium originally envisioned. But if Iridium represents an elusive, once-in-a-decade opportunity, </span>__there are literally dozens of far more accessible opportunities to place payloads aboard commercial geostationary orbiting satellites, 20 or more of which are launched every year__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Geostationary satellite owners have been pitching the hosted payload concept for years but to date have gotten only a handful of takers. Established ﬁxed satellite services providers have steady and predictable fleet replacement cycles and there are enough of them such that the government can count on multiple opportunities with similar characteristics each year. </span>**__The Pentagon faces signiﬁcant declines in its space budget in the coming years even as its demand for space-based services continues to grow__**__. The White House. meanwhile, has made it ofﬁcial policy to leverage commercial space capabilities wherever possible. **It is time to move beyond the lip service Pentagon officials have paid to the hosted payload concept and set up a program** **specifically designed to identify military needs — both** **experimental and operational** — **that could be met with payloads compatible with multiple commercial platforms** that go into assembly in any given year__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__Industry could help the cause by **developing standard interfaces that government piggyback payloads could be designed to**. That way, if a payload misses its targeted flight opportunity, another suitable ride will come along sooner rather than later__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Hosted Payload Alliance. an industry group created to educate prospective government customers on the topic, could play an important role in getting government and manufacturers to agree on common interface standards. </span>__The current ﬂeet replenishment cycle of the major geostationary satellite operators is winding down, but **there still should be plenty of opportunities to exploit in the next few years**. Certainly **there will be no excuse for missing the next big fleet replenishment wave**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The lridium experience, by virtue of its high profile, is </span>__a wake-up call for the Defense Department to finally get serious about leveraging what to date has been an underutilized commercial space resource__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span>


This uniquely cements cooperation in three ways – __institutionalizes__ engagement, provides the __diplomatic capital__ to pursue a multilateral agenda, and ensures the U.S. is __perceived__ as committed

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">A. Option Set I: Leverage foreign launch providers </span>**__Multinational alliances and globalization across the entire commercial space sector__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, especially in the communications satellite segment, </span>**__have increased tremendously__**__, presenting both new challenges and opportunities for U.S. national security__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.’ The March 12, 2010, Space Posture Review: Interim Report states, “Growing international and commercial interest and expertise in space presents opportunities for the United States for further collaboration and partnership in support of U.S. national security space activities, and the global community at large.” This option set explores two approaches to leveraging foreign launch providers—(l) </span>**__the U.S. government may enter into explicit partnerships with foreign providers to assure launch for__** __commercial and **government payloads**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">; or (2) the U.S. government may reevaluate, remove, or streamline certain export control policies and regulations. While the analysis and evaluation of this option set focuses on improving commercial launch customers‘ access to space, </span>__the **policies and actions regarding foreign launch providers have been in the past—and** most likely **will continue to be—used to leverage trade policy, technology control and innovation policy, geopolitics, and national security**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. U.S. government interaction with foreign launch providers has a complex history, often following several avenues at once and often at cross purposes. A. l. Possible actions. </span>__Recognizing the importance of commercial launch capabilities internationally and nationally, **the U.S. government could explore avenues to leverage the world launch market by entering into strategic partnerships**. **Current U.S. government international cooperation—including DoD partnerships to conduct space operations—is a patchwork of agreements that vary** according to the nations involved **and make collaboration among multiple partners more difficult**. This patchwork reﬂects the simple fact that **there is no coherent**. structured **U.S. government strategy for commercial space access that can create synergies within international relationships**. The Space Posture Review: Interim Report notes, “The long history of cooperation in civilian space programs and **U.S. government partnerships with commercial space service providers can serve as a foundation for collaborative global action to shape the future space environment**." **One example of such collaboration would be a U.S. government-Arianespace**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, ILS, CGWIC, or ISRO‘ </span>**__partnership to utilize foreign launch sites__** __and assure launch access prioritization. **The U.S. government would enter into negotiations to assure mutual access to and sharing of industrial base** capacities and **capabilities**. **Such arrangements could begin with national security assets on commercial satellites with hosted payloads**. The main goal would be to view the launch enterprise as a global one, with a global industrial base and global interests. One goal, from a U.S. perspective, would be to ensure it maintains access to space in the face of technical launch problems or natural or man-made disasters affecting U.S. launch sites__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. To more effectively leverage foreign launch providers and improve access for commercial launch customers, the United States should consider using existing legal authority, such as detailed in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and I991, to issue export authorizations for commercial satellite launches, consistent with national security requirements, to all foreign launch providers. The United States should also seek to reform its complex system of U.S. export control laws and regulations. U.S. access to foreign space capabilities faces a signiﬁcant challenge because of this complex system, which fails to acknowledge the dynamics of global space commerce. Action to address this could consist of statutory and regulatory reform, including, but not limited to, possible changes to the ITAR that implement the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778). In the last several years, the Departments of State, Defense, and Commerce have undertaken numerous export control reviews with a push toward actionable recommendations. Most recently, President Obama formed an interagency task force in August 2009 to review export regulations. He announced initial results of his administration's efforts at a March 2010 U.S. Export-Import Bank conference, noting that the “reform program will enhance national security by focusing on the enforcement of strict controls around the export of the most critical technologies and products, while strengthening the competitiveness of key manufacturing industries in the U.S. by streamlining the regulations that apply to their exports“ Several options are under consideration for reforming this system: In Congress, efforts7 are under way to update the Export Administration Act, writ large, and several legislators have voiced strong support, in particular for moving satellites and related components from the State Department-administered U.S. Munitions List (USML) to the Commerce Department-administered Commercial Control List (CCL). These endeavors complement broader efforts in the executive branch to reform the “byzantine amalgam of authorities, roles, and missions scattered around different parts of the federal government" and update antiquated Cold War restrictions found in the Arms Export Control Act and Export Administration Act, in part by creating a single export control list. ln April 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates outlined an export control reform plan that includes “a single export-control list, a single licensing agency, a single enforcement-coordination agency, and a single information-technology system,“ with possible changes enacted before the end of the year. Although implementation details remain undeﬁned, including the extent and likelihood of needed legislation, this plan has the potential to reform to a signiﬁcant degree U.S. export control policies and administration. A third approach would involve using a last-tracking system such as the one developed alter the launch of Operation Enduring Freedom: executive branch agencies could identify tiers of allies for which to speed up reviews while operating within existing legislation and using existing control lists. Reforming the “rule set“ for how ITAR is applied could also be valuable by offering a reassessment of which technologies need to be controlled for export and dealing with issues of timing. review. transparency. and cost in the export licensing process.” A.2. Potential beneﬁts. As the Space Posture Review: Interim Report states succinctly: “</span>**__New opportunities for partnership__** __and collaboration **with both international and commercial space actors have the potential to support future national security space activities and enhance U.S. leadership**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">."" </span>**__Forming alliances__**__. **Encouraging cooperation with foreign entities** could provide several beneﬁts to the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates, </span>__including ensuring continued U.S. access to space after a technical failure or a launch facility calamity. strengthening the competitive position of the U.S. commercial satellite sector. **enhancing the U.S. position in partnerships, and reinforcing collaboration among other space-faring nations**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As the Booz, Allen 8: Hamilton 2000 defense industry "Viewpoint" notes, </span>__strategic commercial alliances: (l) provide capabilities to expand quickly service offerings and markets in ways not possible under time and resource constraints; (2) earn a rate of return 50 percent higher than base businesses—"retums more than double as ﬁrms gain experience in alliances"; and (3) are a powerful altemative to acquiring other companies because they “avoid costly accumulation of debt and buildup of balance sheet goodwill." ‘Z In those respects. **international commercial alliances could help U.S. ﬁrms access foreign funding, business systems. space expertise, technology, and intellectual capital and increase U.S. industry's market share overseas, thus providing economic beneﬁts** to the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates. </span>__Moreover. **U.S. experiences with foreign entities in foreign markets could help those entities obtain the requisite approvals to operate U.S. govemment satellite systems in other countries, resolve satellite spectrum and coordination issues, and mitigate risks associated with catastrophic domestic launch failures** by providing for contingency launch capabilities from foreign nations__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__Multinational alliances would also signal U.S. policymakers’ intent to ensure U.S. commercial and military access to space within a cooperative, international domain, help promote international cooperation, and build support for U.S. positions within various govemmental and business forums__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__First, **partnerships could allow the U**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__to demonstrate greater leadership in mitigating those shared risks related to vulnerability of space assets through launch facility and data sharing, offering improved space situational awareness, establishing collective security agreements for space assets, exploring space deterrence and satellite security doctrines, and formulating and agreeing to rules of the road on the expected peaceful behavior in the space domain__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.” </span>__Second, **partnerships could also help the U**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__build consensus__** __on important space-related issues **in bilateral or multilateral organizations such as the U**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__N__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">ations, </span>__the International Telecommunication Union, **and the W**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">orld </span>**__T__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">rade </span>**__O__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">rganization; </span>**__working with emerging spacefaring nations is particularly important because of their growing presence in__** __the marketplace and participation in **international organizations**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">." </span>__Third, **alliances could serve as a bridge to future collaborative etforts** between U.S. national security forces and U.S. allies__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

That prevents aggression in space
**__Lynn ‘11__** (William J. Lynn, III, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, “A Military Strategy for the New Space Environment,” The Washington Quarterly, Summer 2011, http://www.twq.com/11summer/docs/11summer_Lynn.pdf)
**__To respond to the proliferation of counterspace weapons, the U__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__is employing new ways to prevent and deter aggression__** __against U.S. and allied space systems. In the contested space environment of today, **we can no longer rely solely on the threat of retaliation to protect space systems from attack**. **We must expand our traditional concepts of deterrence**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Accordingly, </span>__the National Security Space Strategy outlines the multilayered approach we will take to deter aggression__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This approach includes several important initiatives. </span>__First, we are assessing **diplomatic initiatives such as the EU Code of Conduct to promote international norms of responsible behavior**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. These initiatives define how responsible space-faring nations are expected to conduct themselves </span>**__and__** __**should over time discourage destabilizing acts that threaten the overall stability of the space domain**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Nations willfully acting contrary to such norms can expect to be isolated as rogue actors. </span>__Second, **we can utilize** **alliances in space** to **serve the same deterrent function as basing troops** **in allied countries**. **They can ensure an attack on one is an attack on all**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__As with terrestrial defense alliances, partnerships in space also can add resilience and capabilities__**__, without relinquishing the strategic advantage our systems provide__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. At their fullest, </span>__these partnerships could consist of completely interoperable systems in which costs, benefits, and risks are shared among trusted participants__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For instance, Australia recently became a full partner in the Wideband Global Satellite Communications System (WGS), which directly supports warfighters. The cost-savings from our partnership with Australia allowed the Pentagon to procure an additional satellite for the WGS constellation. By sharing the benefits and risks of developing this system, we enhanced our operational capability and raised the cost of aggression against it. </span>**__Increasingly, we will want to operate in coalitions in space, just as we do in other domains__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. To achieve this, the department will examine all mission areas to identify where shared interests open the door to greater levels of cooperation. One way to foster greater cooperation is to transform the Joint Space Operations Center, which provides command and control for our space forces, into a Combined Space Operations Center run in concert with international partners. Such an arrangement will allow our partners to work side-by-side with U.S. commanders, improving our situational awareness while integrating a multilateral approach to day-to-day operations. Networking our space operations center with those of our allies offers a further way to expand collaboration. But even as we increasingly work in partnerships, we will maintain some U.S.-only capabilities for our most sensitive national security missions. </span>__Third, **we need to make our space systems more resilient**, and our combat power less reliant on their full functioning. This will help deny adversaries the benefit from an attack in space__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Just as in the cyber domain, </span>**__denying the benefit of attack in space__** __**can join retaliatory deterrence** **as a disincentive to adversaries**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. To maintain our combat power, we are learning how to operate in a degraded information environment. Training exercises where we disrupt space-based capabilities help our forces become proficient at operating with interference. To improve resiliency, we are developing technology to help us mitigate the loss or degradation of on-orbit systems. For instance, we now have ground, air, and naval-based platforms which can increasingly augment or replace space assets. The U.S. military is one of the few militaries today with the capability to operate in all domains on a global basis, and this ability provides a strategic advantage when space capabilities come under threat. Responsive space capabilities which rapidly launch replacements can also play an important role in reconstituting functionality either during or after an attack. And broader partnerships with commercial firms which enable national security payloads to ride on commercial satellites will further improve our resiliency. Hosting military payloads on commercial spacecraft, as we are already doing with a missile warning sensor, is not only cost-effective, it also enables a more diverse, robust, and distributed set of space systems. Finally, the United States views free access to space as a vital national interest. Consistent with our inherent right of self-defense, we will respond accordingly to attacks on it, at a time and place of our choosing</span><span style="font-family: "Arial Narrow",sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">[1]</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">and not necessarily in space. Ultimately, deterrence must impact the decision-making of particular countries and leaders in specific scenarios. </span>**__A multilayered approach to deterrence offers the greatest likelihood of encouraging restraint, and thereby protecting our vital space capabilities from attack__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>


Otherwise, miscalculation makes conflicts and escalation to extinction inevitable
**__Mitchell, et al ‘1__** (Gordon M. Mitchell, Assoc. Prof of Communications, University of Pittsburgh, Kevin Ayotte & David Cram Helwich, “Missile Defense: Transatlantic Diplomacy at a Cross-Roads”, ISIS Briefing on Ballistic Missile Defense No. 6, July 2001)
__A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of 'peace through strength' deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that '… the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use'__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.33 This drift toward usage is strengthened by a strategic fact elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, 'anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand'.34 </span>__The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent 'dual capability' of spaceborne weapon components__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As Marc Vidricaire, Delegation of Canada to the UN Conference on Disarmament, explains: 'If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land'. 35 To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting 'Death Stars', capable of sending munitions hurtling through the Earth's atmosphere. </span>**__The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense 'use or lose' pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig__** __orbiting Death Stars with **automated 'hair trigger' devices**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, </span>__by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious **seeds of accidental conflict**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed </span>__'complexly interactive, tightly coupled' industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other's flawless performance__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. According to Perrow, </span>__this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As Perrow explains, '[t]he odd term "normal accident" is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, </span>__multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable'__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.36 </span>__Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to 'normal accidents'__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, </span>__'**even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage —** **even more than** would be done by **a nuclear weapon**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of the same size!'. 37 In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: 'One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people'.38</span>**__Given this unique potential for destruction__**__, it is not hard to imagine that **any nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear**, biological, and/or chemical **weapons**. **An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span>



Prefer our methodology – deterrence can only function when grounded in cooperation and trust
**__Lupovici ‘8__** (Amir Lupovici, Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Munk Centre for International Studies, University of Toronto, “Why the Cold War Practices of Deterrence are Still Prevalent: Physical Security, Ontological Security and Strategic Discourse,” http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2008/Lupovici.pdf )
__Since deterrence can become part of the actors’ identity, it is also involved in the actors’ will to achieve ontological security, securing the actors’ identity and routines__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As McSweeney explains, </span>__ontological security is “the acquisition of confidence in the routines of daily life—the essential predictability of interaction through which we feel confident in knowing what is going on and that we have the practical skill to go on in this context__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.” These routines become part of the social structure that enables and constrains the actors’ possibilities (McSweeney, 1999: 50-1, 154-5; Wendt, 1999: 131, 229-30). Thus, </span>**__through the emergence of the deterrence norm and the construction of deterrence identities__**__, the **actors create an intersubjective context and intersubjective understandings that in turn affect their interests and routines**. In this context, deterrence strategy and deterrence practices are better understood by the actors, **and** therefore **the continuous avoidance of violence is more easily achieved**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Furthermore, within such a context of deterrence relations, rationality is (re)defined, clarifying the appropriate practices for a rational actor, and this, in turn, reproduces this context and the actors’ identities. Therefore, </span>**__the internalization of deterrence ideas helps__** __to explain how **actors** may **create more cooperative practices and break away from the spiral of hostility that is** forced and maintained by the identities that are **attached to the security dilemma, and which lead to mutual perception of the other as an aggressive enemy**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As Wendt for example suggests, </span>__in situations where states are restrained from using violence—such as MAD (mutual assured destruction)—states not only avoid violence, but “ironically, may be willing to trust each other enough to take on collective identity”__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In such cases if actors believe that others have no desire to engulf them, then it will be easier to trust them and to identify with their own needs (Wendt, 1999: 358-9). In this respect, </span>**__the norm of deterrence, the trust that is being built between the opponents, and the (mutual) constitution of their role identities may all lead to the creation of long term influences that preserve the practices of deterrence as well as the avoidance of violence__**__. **Since a basic level of trust is needed to attain ontological security**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, 21 </span>**__the existence of it may further strengthen the practices of deterrence__** __and the actors’ identities of deterrer and deterred actors__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In this respect, I argue that for the reasons mentioned earlier, </span>__the practices of deterrence should be understood as providing both physical and ontological security, thus refuting that there is necessarily tension between them__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Exactly for this reason I argue that Rasmussen’s (2002: 331-2) assertion—according to which MAD was about enhancing ontological over physical security—is only partly correct. Certainly, MAD should be understood as providing ontological security; but it also allowed for physical security, since, compared to previous strategies and doctrines, it was all about decreasing the physical threat of nuclear weapons. Furthermore, </span>__the ability to increase one dimension of security helped to enhance the other, since it strengthened the actors’ identities and created more stable expectations of avoiding violence__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span>
