CONTENTION ONE: COMPLICITY
The economic order implements an inequality shaped by the better-off which disproportionately hurts the needy. Pogge-1<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Kshithij/Documents/High%20School/Speech%20and%20Debate/LD%20Debate/2011%20Nov%20Dec%20-%20People%20in%20Need/Cases/The%20Real%2099%20Percent%20AC.doc#_ftn1|[1]]]</span>:

And, the severe poverty in developing countries is the fault of greed. Pogge-3:
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Once we break ... the poor countries.</span>

CONTENTION TWO IS THE KILLER.
Severe poverty is the most dehumanizing state of being a living human begin can experience. Robinson and Ciriello<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Kshithij/Documents/High%20School/Speech%20and%20Debate/LD%20Debate/2011%20Nov%20Dec%20-%20People%20in%20Need/Cases/The%20Real%2099%20Percent%20AC.doc#_ftn2|[2]]]</span>:

===Universalizability AC (Glenbrooks)=== 

I affirm.

V: M

1. Universalizability separates morality from expressions of desires. Hare<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Kshithij/Documents/High%20School/Speech%20and%20Debate/LD%20Debate/2011%20Nov%20Dec%20-%20People%20in%20Need/Cases/Reason%20AC.doc#_ftn1|[1]]]</span>:

**__The__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> two features ... however be overcome.</span>

2. Humans rely on practical reason – they require reasons for why they ought to act as they do. Korsgaard<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Kshithij/Documents/High%20School/Speech%20and%20Debate/LD%20Debate/2011%20Nov%20Dec%20-%20People%20in%20Need/Cases/Reason%20AC.doc#_ftn2|[2]]]</span>:

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But </span>**__the human__** ... **__or go forward.__**

If we question why we need reasons, we ask for a reason for reasons, supporting the own argument. Velleman<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Kshithij/Documents/High%20School/Speech%20and%20Debate/LD%20Debate/2011%20Nov%20Dec%20-%20People%20in%20Need/Cases/Reason%20AC.doc#_ftn3|[3]]]</span>:

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As we have ... act for reasons.</span>

The inherent rationality of human beings indicates that the same reasons provided to human beings would result in the same moral law, requiring moral laws to be universalizable. Engstrom<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Kshithij/Documents/High%20School/Speech%20and%20Debate/LD%20Debate/2011%20Nov%20Dec%20-%20People%20in%20Need/Cases/Reason%20AC.doc#_ftn4|[4]]]</span>:

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As we saw, </span>...<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of practical knowledge.</span>

3. Universalizability creates equal moral burdens for all people; it doesn’t levy and judge different obligations. As a result, it provides an equal distribution of human dignity. Any moral theory that allows for discrepancies fails in prescription by saying different obligations can change the situation, which makes the prescription of an obligation worthless. Pettit<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Kshithij/Documents/High%20School/Speech%20and%20Debate/LD%20Debate/2011%20Nov%20Dec%20-%20People%20in%20Need/Cases/Reason%20AC.doc#_ftn5|[5]]]</span>:
**__Every prescription as__** ...<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to confront them.</span>
These are three independent reasons for why the standard is consistency with universalizability.
<span class="cite">The affirmative thesis is that assisting people in need is an act that is a universalizable moral law, meeting the standard and exerting a moral obligation.</span>
<span class="cite">Assisting people in need is an act of beneficence that is universalizable. Herman-1</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Kshithij/Documents/High%20School/Speech%20and%20Debate/LD%20Debate/2011%20Nov%20Dec%20-%20People%20in%20Need/Cases/Reason%20AC.doc#_ftn6|[6]]]</span><span class="cite">: </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This negative answer ... of the good will.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The principle of non-beneficence cannot be rationally universalized. Herman-2<span style="font-size: 10pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Kshithij/Documents/High%20School/Speech%20and%20Debate/LD%20Debate/2011%20Nov%20Dec%20-%20People%20in%20Need/Cases/Reason%20AC.doc#_ftn7|[7]]]</span>:</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">We are not ... anything at all.</span>
<span class="cite">Humans offer rational justification for their actions: they require help to meet their needs, and as a result, have a moral obligation to assist other people in need as well. Gilabert</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Kshithij/Documents/High%20School/Speech%20and%20Debate/LD%20Debate/2011%20Nov%20Dec%20-%20People%20in%20Need/Cases/Reason%20AC.doc#_ftn8|[8]]]</span><span class="cite">:</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The first formulation ... toward each other.</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">Thus the principle of universalizability requires humans to will the maxim of help for their own needs, needing people to assist them. </span>

===Autonomy NC (Glenbrooks)===

**Individuals at the core of morality make rational decisions. Korsgaard[[file:///C:/Users/Kshithij/Documents/High%20School/Speech%20and%20Debate/LD%20Debate/2011%20Nov%20Dec%20-%20People%20in%20Need/Cases/NPO%20NC.doc#_ftn2|**[2]**]]:**

**__It is the__** ... **__source of obligation__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**Thus, the standard is respecting autonomy.**

The thesis of the negative case is that individuals have no positive obligations because it violates their individual autonomy; thus the aff doesn<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">’</span>t happen and you negate.
**Assisting people in need requires taking action.**
