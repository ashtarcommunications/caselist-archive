Sixth, our military strategy is failing because the... will cost more to maintain than the Afghan government can afford. 

**Contention Two: Imperial Overstretch**

**The current COIN strategy is failing—it is distracting the military and hurting the economy.**

The United States emerged from World War II in a position ..., the United States will pay a high price if it endlessly repeats its mistakes. To change our foreign policy—to come to grips with the end of the Pax Americana—we first need to change the way we see the world. 

**Finally—the best case scenario for the current strategy in Afghanistan is even worse than outright failure—staying the course is delusional.**
Tom **Engelhardt**, Fellow at The Nation Institute, author of TomDispatch, Co-founder of the American Empire Project, **2010** (“Tomgram: Engelhardt, The Petraeus Syndrome,” TomDispatch, July 11th, Available Online at http://www.tomdispatch.com/dialogs/print/?id=175272, Accessed 08-31-2010) 
Okay, it hasn’t happened yet -- and the odds... Americans have to deal with, who needs a future Petraeus Syndrome? 

**Thus, Woodward Academy offers the following plan:**

**The United States federal government should substantially draw down its military presence in Afghanistan by shifting from a counter-insurgency strategy to a counter-terrorism strategy that reduces its military footprint to the minimum level needed to help train Afghan security forces, prevent massive human rights atrocities, resist an expansion of Taliban control beyond the Pashtun south, and engage in robust counter-terrorism operations as needed including a decrease to 68,000 troops or less by October 2011 and 30,000 or less by July 2012.**
**We’ll clarify.**

**Contention Three: Solvency**

**First—the plan is a substantial reduction in military presence—this saves billions and reduces resentment.**
**The Afghanistan Study Group**—an ad hoc group of public policy practitioners, former U.S. government officials, academics, business representatives, policy-concerned activists and association leaders concerned with the Obama administration’s policy course in Afghanistan,2010 (“The Way Forward: A Five-Point Approach,” A New Way Forward: Rethinking U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan, August 16th, Available Online at http://www.afghanistanstudygroup.org/NewWayForward_report.pdf, Accessed 08-29-**2010**) 
2. Scale back and eventually Suspend Combat operations in the South ... per year and reduce local resentment at our large and intrusive military presence. 

**Second—shifting to a counter-terrorism posture is key to defeat al Qaeda—the status quo strategy is doomed to failure.**
Austin **Long**, Assistant Professor of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, co-founder of the Working Group on Insurgency and Irregular Warfare at the MIT Center for International Studies and participant in the RAND Counterinsurgency Board of Experts, **2010**(“Small is Beautiful: The Counterterrorism Option in Afghanistan,” Orbis, Volume 54, Issue 2, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via ScienceDirect) 
One of the most important debates ... This would be a clear and cost-effective alignment of resources with goals, the essence of strategy. 

**Third—shifting to counter-terrorism is the most effective strategy—it reduces casualties, reassures allies, and keeps the pressure on extremists.**
Thomas **Snodgrass**, Retired Colonel in the U.S. Air Force, Director of Military Affairs for The Society of Americans for National Existence, Former Adjunct Professor of History at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, 2010 (“Conservatives: Abandoning Counterinsurgency,” The American Thinker, August 5th, Available Online at http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/08/conservatives_abandoning_count.html, Accessed 08-30-**2010**) 
The lesson learned from history must be to do what we ... and quickly as possible. 

**Fourth—the plan is key to prevent precipitous withdrawal—public support makes a long-term counter-insurgency posture politically untenable.**
Steven **Simon**, Adjunct Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Director for Global Issues and Senior Director for Transnational Threats at the National Security Council, **and** Jonathan **Stevenson**, Professor of Strategic Studies at the U.S. Naval War College, **2009** (“Afghanistan: How Much is Enough?,” Survival, Volume 51, Issue 5, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via InformaWorld) 
It follows that the most difficult ... the administration will be compelled to withdraw precipitously, and the United States will lose considerable traction in the region. 

**Finally—pessimistic predictions about the consequences of a drawdown are wrong—we’ll beat their disads with this card alone.**
**The Afghanistan Study Group**—an ad hoc group of public policy practitioners, former U.S. government officials, academics, business representatives, policy-concerned activists and association leaders concerned with the Obama administration’s policy course in Afghanistan,**2010** (“What’s Wrong With The Current U.S Strategy,” A New Way Forward: Rethinking U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan, August 16th, Available Online at http://www.afghanistanstudygroup.org/NewWayForward_report.pdf, Accessed 08-29-2010) 
Second, a U.S. drawdown would not make Al Qaeda substantially more lethal. In order for events in Afghanistan to enhance Al Qaeda’s ability to threaten the U.S. homeland, three separate steps must occur: 1) the Taliban must seize control of a substantial portion of the country, 2) Al Qaeda must ... from Al Qaeda.

Contention One: Grand Strategy 
**First, the current strategy in Afghanistan bogs the U.S. down and constrains the effectiveness of its power.**
**Friedman, 9/08**/10 [George Friedman, internationally recognized expert in security and intelligence issues relating to national security, information warfare and computer security, Founder, Chairman, and Chief Intelligence Officer of Stratfor—a private intelligence company that provides customized intelligence services for its clients, holds a Ph.D. in Government from Cornell University, “9/11 and the 9-Year War,” Republished from Stratfor by RealClearPolitics, September 8, 2010, http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2010/09/08/911_and_the_9-year_war_99164.html) 
The initial response was understandable and necessary…along with the war on al Qaeda. 

**Second – Obama’s trip to Asia proves that Afghanistan prevents the US from having diplomatic influence**

He previously taught at Princeton University and the University of Chicago, where he served as master of the social science collegiate division and deputy dean of social sciences.

I wouldn't call it a "shellacking,"… dug yourself into a deep economic hole. 

**Third, this prevents the U.S. from addressing grand strategic challenges that pose existential risks—drawing down in Afghanistan is necessary to refocus foreign policy and engage with the global commons**
**Bajpai, 9/13**/10 [Kanti Bajpai, Professor of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University (India), Professor in the Politics and International Relations of South Asia at both the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies and the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford (England), “Exit Is A Smarter Strategy,” The Times of India, September 13, 2010, http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/6541291.cms?prtpage=1]

As the public leaking and pundit-wrangling…time to accomplish something. 

**This is an unacceptable outcome—caving to the generals will cement the DOD’s control of U.S. foreign policy and eviscerate civilian control of the military.**
Joshua **Foust**, military intelligence analyst who specializes in the socio-cultural dynamics of irregular warfare, has worked on open-source analysis programs for the Defense Intelligence Agency and as an analyst for the Afghanistan cell of the U.S. Army Human Terrain System, currently serves as the Afghanistan editor at Global Voices Online and writes for Registan.net—the leading academic blog about Central and South Asia, spent 10 weeks in 2009 embedded with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, **11-16**-2010 (“Don’t bring a knife to a gunfight… over Afghan strategy,” Need To Know—a public affairs program on PBS, November 16th, Available Online at http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/voices/don%E2%80%99t-bring-a-knife-to-a-gunfight%E2%80%A6-over-afghan-strategy/5168/, Accessed 11-18-2010) 
And what to make of all the public…and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 

**We will isolate two impacts—the first is CREDIBILITY:**
**Now is the key time for Obama to reassert control and reject the Petraeus Lobby’s pleas for more time to continue COIN—this is vital to reassure allies and restore America’s international credibility.**
Andrew J. **Bacevich**, Professor of History and International Relations at Boston University, graduated from West Point, former Colonel in the United States Army, holds a Ph.D. in American Diplomatic History from Princeton University, **10-05**-2010 (“Obama Must Defy His Generals,” The New Republic, October 5th, Available Online at http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130346439, Accessed 10-12-2010) 
"The President is an elected king,"…thereafter seeking new employment. 

**And, credibility is crucial to spur the international cooperation needed to address emerging threats—failure to do so makes global conflict inevitable.**
**The** **Q**uadrennial **D**efense **R**eview **Independent Panel**—a bipartisan congressional panel charged with conducting an assessment of the assumptions, strategy, findings, and risks described in the Department of Defense’s Quadrennial Defense Review, 20**10** (“The QDR in Perspective: Meeting America’s National Security Needs In the 21st Century,” The Final Report of the Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel, Released on July 29th, Available Online at http://www.usip.org/files/qdr/qdrreport.pdf, Accessed 11-12-2010, p. 28-29) 
These five trends frame a range of choices…higher than anyone would like. 

**The second impact is ADVENTURISM:**
**The usurpation of grand strategy by the military brass will have devastating consequences—military dominance of foreign policy results in tunnel vision, conflict escalation, and adventurist wars that drag the U.S. into perpetual quagmires.**
Eric **Martin**, editor of Obsidian Wings, The Progressive Realist, and American Footprints—three leading foreign policy blogs, holds a B.A. in Philosophy from New York University and a J.D. from Fordham University, **10-09**-2010 (“If All You Have Is A Hammer…,” American Footprints—a foreign policy blog, October 9th, Available Online at http://americanfootprints.com/wp/2010/10/if-all-you-ask-is-a-hammer/, Accessed 10-19-2010) 
One of the maladies plaguing US foreign policy…mythically endowed “surges” etc. 

**The impact is widespread conflict and suffering—military activism makes every impact worse.**
Jeffrey D. **Sachs**, Director of The Earth Institute, Quetelet Professor of Sustainable Development, and Professor of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University, Special Advisor to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, former Director of the UN Millennium Project and Special Advisor to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the Millennium Development Goals, widely considered to be the leading international economic advisor of his generation, holds a Ph.D. from Harvard University, 20**07** (“America’s Failed Militarized Foreign Policy,” Project Syndicate, November 22nd, Available Online at http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs135/English, Accessed 11-18-2010) 
Many of today’s war zones…And we are all mortal.” 

**And, military activism is an unsustainable strategy—reclaiming civilian control of foreign policy is vital to contain threats while maintaining American power.**
Patrick **Porter**, Senior Lecturer in the Defence Studies Department at King’s College London, former Fairfax Oxford Australia Scholar and Fellow of the Institute of Historical Research in London, holds a Ph.D. in Cultural and Religious History from Oxford University, **11-15**-2010 (“The military is not a surgical tool of political engineering,” Guardian, November 15th, Available Online at http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/15/we-may-never-destroy-al-qaida, Accessed 11-18-2010) 
The road to strategic hell…it is time to look in the mirror. 

**Finally, military leaders are engaged in an explicit campaign to manipulate the December Review in order to maintain the current strategy—negative evidence should be assessed with extreme skepticism.**
Michael A. **Cohen**, former Senior Research Fellow at the New America Foundation, B.A. in International Relations from American University and M.A. in International Relations from Columbia University, served in the Department of State as chief speechwriter for U.S. Representative to the United Nations Bill Richardson and Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, currently serves on the board of the National Security Network and has taught at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, **10-29**-2010 (“Petraeus Versus Obama,” Foreign Policy, October 29th, Available Online at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/29/petraeus_versus_obama, Accessed 11-10-2010) 
There are important implications here…the situation in Afghanistan with the truth. 

Contention Three: The War In Afghanistan 
**First, shifting to counter-terrorism is the most effective strategy—it reduces casualties, reassures allies, and keeps the pressure on extremists.**
Thomas **Snodgrass**, Retired Colonel in the U.S. Air Force, Director of Military Affairs for The Society of Americans for National Existence, Former Adjunct Professor of History at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, 8-05-20**10** (“Conservatives: Abandoning Counterinsurgency,” The American Thinker, August 5th, Available Online at http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/08/conservatives_abandoning_count.html, Accessed 08-30-2010) 
The lesson learned from history…and quickly as possible. 

**Second, the war continues to go badly—every COIN metric shows epic failure: governance is hopeless, the elections were a joke, and corruption is rampant.**
Michael A. **Cohen**, former Senior Research Fellow at the New America Foundation, B.A. in International Relations from American University and M.A. in International Relations from Columbia University, served in the Department of State as chief speechwriter for U.S. Representative to the United Nations Bill Richardson and Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, currently serves on the board of the National Security Network and has taught at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, **10-29**-2010 (“Petraeus Versus Obama,” Foreign Policy, October 29th, Available Online at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/29/petraeus_versus_obama, Accessed 11-10-2010) 
What seems most backwards…with official shrugs in Kabul.

__Contention One: Flipping the COIN__

The invasion and ongoing U.S. occupation of Afghanistan is founded on a dominant discourse rooted in __colonialism__—fears of Islamic terrorism have combined with images of oppressed Muslim women to __justify American conquest__.

__Specifically__, the population-centric counterinsurgency mission in Afghanistan is __profoundly gendered__—U.S. military presence relies on the __reproduction of gendered hierarchies__.

__And__, this conflation of the “War On Terrorism” with the “War For Afghan Women” is being used to __justify conquest__—the __underlying framework__ of the war is __epistemologically indefensible__.

Thus the plan: The United States federal government should end the war in Afghanistan.

We’ll clarify.


__Contention Two: Solvency__

__First__, U.S. military presence is __devastating the people of Afghanistan__—concerns about the harms of withdrawal are __terminally non-unique__.

__Second__, ending the war is the only ethical option—every day that the war continues __guarantees violence and suffering__.

**A. Interpretation - presence requires forward deployed forces physically present within the country**

(Bradford, “National Security Strategy and Forward Presence: Implications for Acquisition and Use of Forces,” March, http://cna.org/sites/default/files/research/2793019200.pdf) Italics in original, CONUS = Continental United States
Another difference between…considered part of presence.



==Critiques== 

===Positive Peace K=== 

**The Schema---Peace is a psychological not material factor. Traditional conflict management strategies promote militarism through symptom focus promoting structural violence. Failure to explore the psychological roots of enemy creation makes the 1AC harms and inherency claims suspect.**
**Smoke and Harman, 87** [Richard Smoke BA Harvard magna cum laude, PhD MIT, Professor at Brown, Winner Bancroft Prize in History, and Willis Harman M.S. in Physics and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, Paths To Peace, 1987, Entire Preface] The existence of nuclear weapons…is to believe it can be done 

**The AFF represents an unstable world needing innovative solutions to constant problems, which entrenches insecurity logic. The impact is a circular apocalyptic impulse that makes every impact inevitable.**
**Chernus, 01** [Ira, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, “Fighting Terror in the National Insecurity State,” http://spot.colorado.edu/~chernus/WaronTerrorismEssays/FightingTerror.htm] And the vision of an endless…a genuinely secure future 

**The impact turns and outweighs the case**
**Zuleuta, 04** [Felicity de Zuleuta, MD Cambridge, Psychotherapist, Attachment and Human Survival ed Green and Scholes, 2004] It is clear that childhood…mankind is to survive 

**Critical praxis outweighs policy making---voting affirmative guarantees error replication. Only a radical break from dominant paradigms can avoid becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy**
**Cheeseman and Bruce, 96** [Graeme Cheesman Senior Lecturer at New South Wales, and Robert Bruce Associate Professor in social sciences at Curtin University, Discourses of Danger & Dread Frontiers, 1996, p. 5-9] This goal is pursued in ways…not to understand to understand them, and why? 

===Cult of Reputation K=== 

__First__, the affirmative is caught up in __the cult of reputation__—the assumption that the U.S.’s credibility is __its own possession__ and that it __spills over across issues and to other countries__ is __demonstrably false__. 
Shiping <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tang</span></span>, Associate Research Fellow and Deputy Director of the Center for Regional Security Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, Co-director of the Sino-American Security Dialogue, <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2005</span></span> (“Reputation, Cult of Reputation, and International Conflict,” //Security Studies//, Volume 14, Number 1, January-March, p. 41-45)

__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">Second</span>__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">, the U.S. __can’t control the perceptions of others__—the __underlying assumptions__ of </span>the cult of reputation are __logically__ and __empirically__ bankrupt.

Christopher J. <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fettweis</span></span>, Assistant Professor of National Security Affairs in the National Security Decision Making Department at the U.S. Naval War College, holds a Ph.D. in International Relations and Comparative Politics from the University of Maryland-College Park, 2007-<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2008</span></span> (“Credibility and the War on Terror,” //Political Science Quarterly//, Volume 122, Number 4, Winter, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via IngentaConnect, p. 633)

__Third__, this __turns the case__—the belief in credibility __empirically causes war__. 
Shiping <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tang</span></span>, Associate Research Fellow and Deputy Director of the Center for Regional Security Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, Co-director of the Sino-American Security Dialogue, <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2005</span></span> (“Reputation, Cult of Reputation, and International Conflict,” //Security Studies//, Volume 14, Number 1, January-March, p. 46)

The alternative is to __stop believing in credibility__. 
Basing decisions on perceptions of credibility makes __serial policy failure__ inevitable—__decades of scholarship__ are on our side. 
Christopher J. <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fettweis</span></span>, Assistant Professor of National Security Affairs in the National Security Decision Making Department at the U.S. Naval War College, holds a Ph.D. in International Relations and Comparative Politics from the University of Maryland-College Park, <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2009</span></span> ("Madmen in Authority: Threats, Pathology and Grand Strategy," Paper Presented at the Annual Meeting of the International Society of Political Psychology, June, Available Online at http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p314364_index.html , p. 4-6) 
<span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Many academic fields deal with pathology...</span></span>international system as a whole.


__Finally__, even if their policy recommendation is right, vote negative because __their justification for it is not__—we’ll beat their permutations and framework arguments with this evidence alone. 
Joshua <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Foust</span></span>, military intelligence analyst who specializes in the socio-cultural dynamics of irregular warfare, has worked on open-source analysis programs for the Defense Intelligence Agency and as an analyst for the Afghanistan cell of the U.S. Army Human Terrain System, currently serves as the Afghanistan editor at //Global Voices Online// and writes for //Registan.net//—the leading academic blog about Central and South Asia, spent 10 weeks in 2009 embedded with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2010</span></span> (“The Afghanistan Study Group Report: An Exercise in Determined Ignorance,” //Registan.net//, September 11th, Available Online at http://www.registan.net/index.php/2010/09/11/the-afghanistan-study-group-report-an-exercise-in-determined-ignorance/, Accessed 09-28-2010) 
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">But in a real way, this is symptomatic...</span>We can do better.



==Disadvantages== 
===Turkey Deterrence=== 

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">**TNW withdrawal kills US credibility, spurs allied prolif and collapses NATO cohesion**</span>

===South Korea Deterrence=== 
Same as the 1NC on Nasir Nanjee and Ronak Dave, except these two new cards:


**China and the U.S. are vying for power – recent visits to Asia reassert our hegemony**
**Gelb, 11/3** [Leslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist and senior government official, is author of Power Rules: How Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy (HarperCollins 2009), a book that shows how to think about and use power in the 21st century. He is president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. “Obama's Next Headache,” The Daily Beast, 11/3/10, http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-03/obamas-asia-trip-balancing-chinas-power-without-inflaming-beijing] 
President Obama’s 10-day trip to Asia… decisions essential to reigniting the American economy. 

**Withdrawal now crushes deterrence – current aggressive stance is key**
**Carroll, 11/23** [Conn Carroll is the Assistant Director for The Heritage Foundation's Strategic Communications and he serves as editor of The Foundry, the think tank's rapid-response policy blog, “Morning Bell: Don’t Give In To North Korea Demands,” The Foundry, November 23, 2010, http://blog.heritage.org/2010/11/23/morning-bell-don%E2%80%99t-give-in-to-north-korea-demands/] 
At 2:43 PM local time today… ships and airplanes that they see in the region."


===START=== 

**New START will be ratified by the Senate before the end of the lame duck session but it will be close and Obama’s political capital is key.**
Jim **Lobe**, Washington bureau chief for Inter Press Service, **12-02**-2010 (“Obama Pushes START Treaty to Top of Legislative Agenda,” Inter Press Service, December 2nd, Available Online at http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=53758, Accessed 12-04-2010) 
With time running out…We do taxes and then we do START." 

**Withdrawal would be massively unpopular – several reasons**
**Harrison 03** (Selig, Director of the Asia Program at the Center for International Policy, is a senior scholar of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and director of the Century Foundation’s Project on the United States and the Future of Korea. He has specialized in South Asia and East Asia for fifty years as a journalist and scholar and is the author of six books on Asian affairs and U.S. relations with Asia, Baluch expert and left wing theorist at the Carnegie Institute. Former managing editor of The New Republic, Former senior fellow in charge of Asian studies at the Brookings Institution, Senior fellow at the East-West Center and Lecturer in Asian studies at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, Adjunct professor of Asian studies at the Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University, “Korean Endgame: A Strategy for Reunification and U.S. Disengagement”, p. 181-182) 
Why has the presence of U.S. ground forces… their headquarters in the United States. 

**START prevents nuclear war**
John **Isaacs**, Executive Director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, December 4, 20**09**. The Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation, “Rebuttals to Arguments Against New START,” http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/nuclearweapons/articles/rebuttals_to_arguments_against_new_start/ 
First, it is not necessarily the case… A new arms control treaty will reduce this risk.

===SKFTA=== 

**SKFTA will be voted on within weeks.**
**Reuters, 2/16** [Doug Palmer, “Obama wants all three trade pacts passed: Geithner,” February 16, 2011, http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/16/us-usa-trade-geithner-idUSTRE71F4X020110216] 
(Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Wednesday… on executive pay during the financial crisis. 

**Withdrawal will crush Obama’s political capital – Carter proves**
**Feffer, 04** [6/23/04, John, contributor to Foreign Policy in Focus and the author of North Korea, South Korea: U.S. Policy at a Time of Crisis, “Bring Our Troops Home (from Korea),” http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig5/feffer1.html] 
North Korea has argued that it is under threat… through a complete withdrawal. 

**PC is key to pressure democrats and tea party members.**
**The Wharton School, 1/12** [University of Pennsylvania “U.S.-South Korea Trade Pact: A Turning Point for American Exports?” Knowledge at Wharton, Law and Public Policy, http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2671] 
Spooner, a Republican, notes that Republican Rob Portman… Boehner and Cantor pressure them firmly. 

**Failing to ratify SKFTA kills the alliance and economic ties**
**Bandow, 10/20/10** [Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, former special assistant to President Ronald Reagan, he is the author of Tripwire: Korea and U.S. Foreign Policy in a Changed World (Cato Institute), “A Free Trade Agreement with South Korea Would Promote Both Prosperity and Security,” The Cato Institute, Trade Briefing Paper no. 31, October 20, 2010, http://www.cato.org/pubs/tbp/tbp-031.pdf] 
Conclusion: The High Cost of Rejection… its influence throughout East Asia. 

**Economic collapse causes global nuclear war**
**Mead, 09** [Walter Russell, Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, The New Republic, “Only Makes You Stronger”, 2/4, http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=571cbbb9-2887-4d81-8542-92e83915f5f8&p=2] 
If current market turmoil seriously damaged the performance… we may still have to fight.


===South Korean Investment DA=== 

**First, the South Korean economy is growing in the status quo—2010 was a banner year.**
**JoongAng Daily**—an English language daily newspaper in South Korea, **01-27**-2011 (“Economic growth last year was best since 2002,” January 27th, Available Online at http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2931549, Accessed 02-14-2011) 
Korea’s economy grew by 6.1 percent in 2010… The economy has grown since the first quarter of 2009. 

**Second, the plan devastates the South Korean economy—U.S. military presence is vital to investor confidence.**
**Ronald S. Mangum**, Professor at the American Military University, retired Brigadier General in the United States Army, served as Commanding General of the Special Operations Command Korea, holds an M.A. in Diplomacy and Military Science from Norwich University, 20**04** (“Joint Force Training: Key to ROK Military Transformation,” The Korean Journal of Defense Analysis, Volume 26, Number 1, Spring, Available Online at http://www.kida.re.kr/data/2006/04/13/06_ronald_s_mangum.pdf, Accessed 02-14-2011, p. 126) 
Many Koreans ignore the fact that… to improve the capability of its forces. 

**Third, the South Korean economy is key to Asian democracy.**
**Newsweek, 2010** (1/29/10, “Selling South Korea,” http://www.newsweek.com/2010/01/28/selling-south-korea.html) 
In short, the South Korean model is a more mature cousin… to them than, say, that of China." 

**Extinction.**
**Diamond, 95** (Larry, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, founding co-editor of the Journal of Democracy, Professor of Political Science and Sociology and Coordinator of the Democracy Program at the the Center on Democracy at Stanford University, "Promoting Democracy in the 1990s: Actors and instruments, issues and imperatives : a report to the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict", December 1995, June 26th 2010, http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/di.htm) 
This hardly exhausts the lists of threats… accountability, popular sovereignty, and openness.

===Japan BMD Deterrence=== 

**BMD is key to stability and alliance deterrence credibility.**
**Auslin, 10** [Michael Auslin is a resident scholar at AEI. “The U.S.-Japan Alliance,” January, 2010, http://www.aei.org/outlook/100929] 
Still, the various challenges the alliance faces… U.S. and Japanese military superiority. 

**BMD is key to deterrence capability and solve proliferation – now is key – rising threat from missile capability.**
**Klingner, 11** [Bruce Klingner is Senior Research Fellow for Northeast Asia in the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation. “The Case for Comprehensive Missile Defense in Asia,” January 7, 2011, Backgrounder #2506, The Heritage Foundation, http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2011/01/The-Case-for-Comprehensive-Missile-Defense-in-Asia] 
The United States and its allies are at risk… North Korean or Iranian missiles.”[3] 

**And missile proliferation causes miscalculation and lowers the threshold for nuclear war.**
**Cimbala, 2008** [Stephen, Distinguished Prof. Pol. Sci. – Penn. State Brandywine, Comparative Strategy, “Anticipatory Attacks: Nuclear Crisis Stability in Future Asia”, 27, Informa World] 
If the possibility existed of a mistaken preemption… the obsolescence or marginalization of major interstate warfare.

===<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Congress CP</span>=== 

**CP Text: Congress should fund the withdrawal costs from South Korea**

**The counterplan is mutually exclusive with the plan—only the President can order a withdrawal—Congressional action to eliminate funding is a distinct action that results in withdrawal.**
**Rosen, 07** [Jeffrey Rosen is the legal affairs editor of The New Republic and author of The Most Democratic Branch: How the Courts Serve America. "In Wartime, Who Has the Power?" 
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/weekinreview/04rosen.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1] 
Legal scholars — both critics and supporters… for specified numbers of troops. 

**The counterplan is key to reign in the Imperial Presidency—Congressional use of the power of the purse is the best way to reassert legislative control of checks and balances**
**Raven-Hansen and Banks, 94** [Peter Raven-Hansen Research Professor of Law, The National Law Center, George Washington University, William C.

Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Robert F. Kennedy. “The Imperial Presidency”, 2004, p. 497-498] 
There is little more typically American than… involving the United States in useless wars and grandiose dreams. 

**Sole presidential authority makes nuclear war inevitable**

A basic theory--if not the basic theory of our Constitution… remains in the sole possession of the President. 

===Taliban Negotiations CP=== 
CP Text: The United States should immediately enter into diplomatic negotiations with the Afghan Taliban, Pakistani military, and members of the Afghan government and Northern Alliance. In exchange for a guarantee by the Taliban that it will not provide al Qaeda or other terrorist organizations with a safe haven in Afghanistan and that it will agree to allow the United States military to continue counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda in Afghanistan, the United States should agree to a ceasefire and offer to provide the Taliban with amnesty and representation in a coalition government. Pursuant to a negotiated agreement, the United States should seek formal United Nations recognition of the coalition government by inviting nations including but not limited to India, Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia to participate in an international diplomatic conference. If the Taliban is unwilling to negotiate, the United States should continue its existing counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan.
We’ll clarify.

__First__, __now is the key time__—the counterplan effectively __spurs peace talks__ and __a political settlement__ but delays will __bolster the Taliban__ and __doom negotiations__.

==Turkey Negative== 
===Credibility Frontline=== 
**Removal of TNWs will cause Turkey to rearm which is worse**
Mustafa **Kibaroglu**, Teacher at Department of International Relations at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey, Fellow at Harvard University, Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of Internation Studies, International Atomic Energy Agency, and United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, June **10**, “Reassessing the Role of U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Turkey”, Arms Control Association, http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2010_06/Kibaroglu#25]) There is a common belief… nuclear capabilities. 

**Turkey wants to keep TNW’s**
**Kelleher**, senior fellow at the Watson Institute at Brown University, **2009**(Catherine, “Getting to zero starts here”, Arms Control Today, October, proquest, 6-24-10, RH) The role of tactical nuclear weapons… its own nuclear weapons. 

**Conflict doesn’t escalate**
**Takeyh et al 07** Senior Fellow for ME Studies at Council on Foreign Relations, June 28, 2007 [“Why the Iraq war won't engulf the Mideast,” http://www.cfr.org/publication/13702/why_the_iraq_war_wont_engulf_the_mideast.html] Yet, the Saudis, Iranians, Jordanians… enveloping the entire Middle East. 

**Iran is rational**
**Steff 2010** (Reuben, Intern, Centre for Strategic Studies. Dissertation on ballistic missiles and deterrence. MA, The Russian Resurgence, America and the Great Crisis of 2010, 7 January 2010, http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1001/S00022.htm) But numerous scholars have… deterrent to outside coercion. 

**Iranian prolif doesn’t spill over**
**Procida 2009** (Frank, National Intelligence Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Why an Iranian Nuclear Bomb Is Not the End of the World, 9 June 2009, http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65127/frank-procida/overblown) Since the advent of the… successes in the near future. 

**Prolif will be slow**
**Tepperman 2009** (Jon Tepperman, Managing Editor of Foreign Affairs. “Why Obama Should Learn to Love the Bomb” Newsweek, 30 Aug, Lexis) The risk of an arms race… bombs tend to mellow behavior. 

===Terrorism Frontline=== 
**Nuclear terrorism is not the greatest threat that faces America, as of now, there just is no probability that terrorist would even use the weapons**
**Doherty 2010** (“Not Our Greatest Threat”, by Patrick C. Doherty, Director of the Smart Strategy Initiative within the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation. New American Foundation, Published: April 12, 2010 http://smartstrategy.newamerica.net/node/30439, Accessed 7.5.2010) First, on the threat… think they’re fooling?

**No risk of terrorism: nuclear weapons secure****Knops 10** (Raymond, Netherlands representative, NATO Parliamentary Assembly, 048 DSCFC 10 E - U.S. NON-STRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN EUROPE: A FUNDAMENTAL NATO DEBATE, http://www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=2083) Recent incidents have also… internal oversight procedures. 

**Terror threat overblown – more likely to be hit by a comet**
John **Mueller**, “Is There Still a Terrorist Threat?” FOREIGN AFFAIRS v. 85 n. 5, September/October **2005**, p. 2+. But while keeping such potential… an enemy that scarcely exists.

==South Korea Negative== 
===Korean War Frontline=== 

**North Korean collapse is not likely – Chinese support and empirics prove**
**Carlin and Lewis, 11/22** [Robert Carlin is a visiting fellow at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation. John W. Lewis is professor emeritus of Chinese politics at Stanford. Both have visited North Korea several times. “Review U.S. policy toward North Korea,” The Washington Post, November 22, 2010, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/21/AR2010112102276.html] 
While the United States has stood aside… sovereign state with its own interests.

**Tensions high but no risk of escalation**
**CSM, 11/23** [Tom A. Peter, Correspondent, “North and South Korea clash across tense border,” Christian Science Monitor, Nov 23, 2010, http://www.csmonitor.com/World/terrorism-security/2010/1123/North-and-South-Korea-clash-across-tense-border?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+feeds/csm+(Christian+Science+Monitor+|+All+Stories) 
North and South Korea exchanged artillery fire… and most recently in November 2009. 

**Provocation doesn’t signal war – it’s a tool to exact more aid from Washington – North Korea doesn’t want war means withdrawal can’t solve provocation**
**Lee, 11/24** [Sunny Lee is a Seoul-born columnist and journalist; he has degrees from the US and China, Asia Times, “Bang! Now let's talk,” November 24, 2010, http://atimes.com/atimes/Korea/LK24Dg01.html] 
BEIJING - North Korea's surprising disclosure…said Koh at Stanford University.


===Regionalism Frontline=== 

**1.) Regionalism will fail – multiple barriers to cooperation**
**Baker, 10** [Carl Baker, the director of programs and coeditor of Comparative Connections at Pacific Forum CSIS, adjunct professor at Hawaii Pacific University, has extensive experience in Korea, having served as an international political-military affairs officer for the UN Military Armistice Commission and as a political and economic intelligence analyst for U.S. Forces Korea, “The Future of US Alliances in Asia: US-Japan-ROK Alliance Dialogue,” Issues & Insights, Vol. 10-No. 24, October 2010, http://csis.org/files/publication/issuesinsights_vol10n24.pdf] 
Throughout the discussions…could help mitigate these negative influences. 

**2.) China has no hope of encouraging greater regionalism – it alienates regional actors – regardless U.S. is increasing influence in Asia now**
**Bloomberg News, 9/27/10** (“China’s Charm Blitz in ‘Shambles’ Over Regional Spats,” 
http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-09-27/china-s-charm-blitz-in-shambles-over-regional-spats.html) 
Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- China may be undermining…a petty, third-world country.” 

**3.) U.S. participation is key to regionalism**
**Clinton, 10** [Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of State, “Remarks on Regional Architecture in Asia: Principles and Priorities,” January 12, 2010, http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135090.htm] 
A core strategic fact is that…to strengthen this institutionalized process.


===China Relations Frontline=== 

**The U.S. is pursuing a Chinese containment strategy in the status quo—even if the plan removes one tactic used in that strategy, it doesn’t remove the strategy itself.**
Oh **Young-hwan**, editor of foreign policy and security affairs at the JoongAng Ilbo—one of the three largest newspapers in South Korea, **11-19**-2010 (“The U.S. confronts China,” Korea JoongAng Daily, November 19th, Available Online at http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2928569, Accessed 11-19-2010) 
The primary focus of U.S. foreign policy…divided among India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan. 

**China will be more receptive to U.S. policy concerning Korea**
**CSM, 11/23** [Peter Grier, Staff writer, Christian Science Monitor, “North Korean attack: What are US options for response?” November 23, 2010, http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2010/1123/North-Korean-attack-What-are-US-options-for-response] 
Policy on North Korea…Success has been limited, to put it mildly. 

**There’s no motive – interdependence and Chinese economic vulnerability remove any incentive for war**
**Scott and Coumatos, 08** (Michael and William, coauthors of Space Wars: The First Six Hours of World War III. “Would China Start a War in Space?” Aviation Week & Space Technology; 1/7/2008, Vol. 168 Issue 1, p62-62.) 
A key question now being asked is…the likelihood of conflict in space is slim.


**They can’t access a sufficient solvency claim—simply doing something about warming isn’t enough—drastic action is both necessary and impossible.**
Oliver **Tickell**, British journalist, author, and campaigner on health and environment issues, 20**08** (“On a planet 4C hotter, all we can prepare for is extinction,” Guardian, August 11th, Available Online at http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange, Accessed 11-11-2010) 
But what are we to do?...it is a price well worth paying.


===North Korean Denuclearization Frontline=== 

**Diplomacy will inevitably fail – denuclearization is impossible – multiple barriers**
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;">**Bandow, 11/22** [Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. A former special assistant to Ronald Reagan, he is the author and editor of several books, including “Tripwire: Korea and U.S. Foreign Policy in a Changed World” (Cato) and “The Korean Conundrum: America’s Troubled Relations with North and South Korea.” Korea Times, “Dealing with a nuclear North Korea,” November 22, 2010, http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2010/11/137_76750.html] </span></span>
North Korea is a nuclear power…the issue to the North’s neighbors. 

**No risk of disarmament – new facilities prove**
**The Times of India, 11/27** [Nayan Chanda, staff writer, “North Korea: Sticky Issues,” Nov 27, 2010, http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/opinion/edit-page/North-Korea-Sticky-Issues/articleshow/6996224.cms] 
The phrase 'hiding in plain sight'…if not meaningless. 

**China will never pressure North Korea**
**Tobey and Miller, 11/23** [William Tobey was a deputy administrator at the National Nuclear Security Administration and is now a senior fellow at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Judith Miller is a contributing editor of City Journal, an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and a FOX News contributor. City Journal, “Peninsula of Fear,” November 23, 2010, http://www.city-journal.org/2010/eon1123jmwt.html] 
Finally, there is an unhappy consensus…over its nuclear activities.


==Afghanistan Security== 

===Case=== 
**1. Debates about threats in the academic world result in better policy-making—real threats can be confronted and risks can be weighed.**
**Walt 91** – Professor of Political Science, University of Chicago – 1991 (Stephen, INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY, p. 229-30) 
A recurring theme of this essay… an additional avenue of influence. 

**2. Risk in the international system is inevitable—the goal should be to weigh the impacts of action vs inaction in the face of a particular threat.**
**Harvard Nuclear Study Group 83** (Living with Nuclear Weapons, p.16-7) 
When President John F. Kennedy…course and decide on policy accordingly. 

**3. Some states are genuine threats—we think Afghanistan is a good example.**
**Kydd 97** – Professor of Political Science of California, Riverside, SECURITY STUDIES, Autumn 1997 p. 154 
As for the Second World War…at the root of conflict, not security concerns. 

**4. There is no single root cause of war—complexity dooms monocausal explanations like “securitization causes all wars”.**
Vivienne **Jabri**, Lecturer in International Relations at the University of Kent, 19**96** (“Introduction: Conflict Analysis Reconsidered,” Discourses on Violence: Conflict Analysis Reconsidered, Published by Manchester University Press ND, ISBN 0719039592, p. 3) 
The study of war has produced…common features leading up to the decision for war.2 

**5. Predictive policy analysis is desirable even if it is sometimes wrong—wholesale rejection is comparatively worse.**
Michael **FITZSIMMONS**, defence analyst at a Washington DC consulting firm, 20**06**
[“The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning,” Survival, Volume 48, Issue 4, December, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via InformaWorld] 
For all of its importance, however…future upon which strategy depends. 

**6. There are no prior questions to pragmatic policy action—focusing on epistemology or ontology distract us from good decision-making.**
**Owen, 02** – Reader of Political Theory at the University of Southampton (David, Reader of Political Theory at the Univ. of Southampton, Millennium Vol 31 No 3 p. 655-657) 
Commenting on the ‘philosophical turn’ in IR…and so a potentially vicious circle arises. 

**7. Calculation is inevitable and good – their ethics justify the worst crimes against humanity.**
David **Campbell**, Professor of International Politics at the University of Newcastle (England), 19**99**
["The Deterritorialization of Responsibility: Levinas, Derrida, and Ethics after the End of Philosophy," Moral Spaces: Rethinking Ethics and World Politics, edited by David Campbell and Michael J. Shapiro, Published by the University of Minnesota Press, ISBN 0816632758, p. 45-46 // BATMAN] 
That undecidability resides within the decision…religious or nationalist fanaticism."93 

**8. Public policy-making requires suspension of academic unconstrained search for truth – if they want their philosophical arguments to matter, they have to play the policy-making game.**
Dan W. **Brock**, Professor of Philosophy and Biomedical Ethics at Brown University, 19**87** (“Truth or Consequences: The Role of Philosophers in Policy-Making," Ethics, Volume 97, July, Available Online via JSTOR, p. 787) 
When philosophers become more or less direct participants…What are they doing there?
