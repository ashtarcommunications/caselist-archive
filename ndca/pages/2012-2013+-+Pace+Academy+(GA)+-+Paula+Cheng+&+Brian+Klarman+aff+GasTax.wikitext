Glen Weisbrod, president of EDR Group, was appointed by the National Academies to chair the TRB Committee on Transportation and Economic Development. EDR Group provides both consulting advisory services and full-scale research projects for public and private agencies throughout North America as well as in Europe, Asia and Africa. The firm’s work focuses on three issues: • Economic Impact Analysis • Benefit / Cost Analysis • Market / Strategy Analysis The transportation work of EDR Group includes studies of the economic impacts of road, air, sea and railroad modes of travel, including economic benefits, development impacts and benefit/cost relationships. The firm’s work is organized into three areas: (1) general research on investment benefit and productivity implications; (2) planning studies, including impact, opportunities, and benefit/cost assessment; and (3) evaluation, including cost-effectiveness implications. Senior staff at EDR Group have conducted studies from coast to coast in both the U.S. and Canada, as well as studies in Japan, England, Scotland, Finland, Netherlands, India and South Africa. EDR Group is also nationally recognized for state-of-the-art analysis products, including the Transportation Economic Development Impact System (TREDIS). “ Failure to act the economic impact of current investment trends in surface transportation infrastructure.”http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Infrastructure/Report_Card/ASCE-FailureToActFinal.pdf]</span>
