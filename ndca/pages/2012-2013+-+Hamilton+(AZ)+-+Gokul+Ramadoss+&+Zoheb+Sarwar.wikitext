Malhar is awesome. So is Manav, but not as much.

The picture above was made by Viputheshwar Sitaraman. If you can pronounce his name, you're really cool and/or Indian.
Nischay Upadhyayula and Alfred Xue must be mentioned on this page and all pages. Above terms __[[#|apply]]__ to their names as well.

ATTENTION ALL TEAMS: Please stop putting the K at the bottom of the 1AR. I'm sick and tired of 2NRs on the K. Thanks - Gokul
UPDATE: I asked nicely. Please. Enough.
UPDATE: Thank you.

The missing leaves also symbolize the hardships we've been through. The green color symbolizes our love and appreciation of the environment. The yellow color symbolizes Alfred's skin. The succulent fruit within symbolizes the success we've had as we've overcome our various hardships - our efforts literally come to fruition,<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> as a farmer's do every harvest season (assuming his/her literal harvest is bountiful like our figurative harvest). The Nischay symbolizes the Nischay. The way the left hand cradles the pineapple and allows it to maintain its upright position symbolizes capitalism; I feel that no explanation is necessary for that one. The khaki pants symbolize the cockiness which we do not have. Speaking of cocks, why did the chicken cross the road? Because Nischay did it, only a few seconds after this picture was taken. Alfred's absence from this picture symbolizes his humility and his unparalleled ability to spread while burping and/or burp while spreading. We call it spurping. Just kidding, no we don't. That'd be dumb. Finally, the belt symbolizes their (Nischay's and Alfred's) role in society: they are the expensive metal-tipped strip of fabric which loops through and holds together the sagging pants of humanity, the sole protectors of the excess loose fabric around the belt area known in some circles as "waist waste," the only thing preventing said metaphorical pants from slipping from the aforementioned metaphorical waist and revealing the stained underpants of the human race.</span></span></span><span style="display: block; text-align: left;">

*Forensic scientists investigating the murder of Jesus Christ hired a policy debater for advice on //cross examination//. (The debater was chosen for the job based on her experience in the National Forensics League.) - double pun :D

*The robber had a head start over the police car chasing him because the officer was an old-school policy debate judge who didn't like speed and took prep for flashing.

*Why do our ports need to be dredged? I like big boats and I cannot lie.

*What's the difference between a policy team and a pair of worn-out sneakers? Nothing - they have no soles and nobody likes them.

*What do a policy debater and a butler have in common? They both get yelled at if they drop tea.

*What's the difference between a policy debater and a Congress member? One's smarter and the other one doesn't have fiat.

*What's the difference between policy and PF? One's a debate event.

*What do a policy debater and a potato have in common? Eyes, rhizomes, and an inability to create real-world change.

*Why did the chicken cross the road? To flaunt its limitless access to transportation infrastructure and thus reify the insidious social hierarchy of ableism inherent in American chicken culture.
