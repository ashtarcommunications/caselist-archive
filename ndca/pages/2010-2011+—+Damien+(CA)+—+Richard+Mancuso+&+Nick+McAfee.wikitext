­­­**Observation One – The Status Quo**

**In 2006 the U.S. and Japan agreed to close Marine Corps Air Station Futenma IF Japan built a replacement facility for it in Nago City. Japan’s current Prime Minister committed to follow through with the agreement in May BUT local political and public opposition will prevent the move from ever taking place.**
Asahi Shimbun 9-15-10 (“Nago assembly election,” http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201009140366.html) 
Tokyo's agreement with Washington to relocate …the Tokyo-Washington agreement has become more difficult than ever. 

**And, Even though Kan was just re-elected as the Prime Minister, there is zero chance that he will be able to convince Okinawa to accept the relocation of Futenma to Nago**
Allen, of Stars & Stripes, 9-14-10 (David, “Realignment plans look firm as Kan wins DPJ presidential election,” http://www.stripes.com/news/realignment-plans-look-firm-as-kan-wins-dpj-presidential-election-1.118119) 
Although Tuesday’s [the] party election went … Futenma issue will be resolved as Mr. Kan intends.” 

**Now is the KEY time to resolve the basing dispute – It’s the only way to prevent a complete collapse of the U.S. Japan relationship.**
Smith, Senior Fellow for Japan at the Council on Foreign Relations, 7-26-10 (Sheila, “Successful U.S.-Japan agenda must meet public expectations,” The Nikkei Weekly) 
Our shared interests are broad, … that will carry us into the next generation.

**And, Basing disputes in Okinawa are the most significant issue facing the Alliance – Failure to reduce the burden of Marines undermines the best mechanism for regional and global security.**
Barkdoll, Commander in the U.S. Navy & Masters of Strategic Studies, 3-15-6 (Timothy, “The U.S.-Japan Security Alliance: Welcoming a New Japan,” USAWC Strategy Research Project, U.S. Army War College) 
The security alliance has served as the cornerstone …with Okinawa presenting the most significant challenge in that pursuit.

**What the U.S. should do is substantially reduce the number of Marines in Japan – It preserves the entirety of our detterence and warfighting capabilities**
O’Hanlon, Director of Research & Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy at Brookings, Director of Research for the 21st Centry Defense Initiative, 97 (Michael, “Restructuring U.S. Forces & Bases In Japan,” Toward a True Allicane: Restructuring U.S.-Japan Security Relations, ed. Mike Mochizuki) 
Option one would reduce the marine …storage, would keep the total amount of Marine Corps equipment on Okinawa unchanged from what it is today. P. 163-4 

**And, This prevents the collapse of political and public support for the alliance and preserves support for the rest of our troops in Japan**
Mochizuki, Ph.D., Japan-U.S. Relations Chair in Memory of Gaston Sigur at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University, 97 (Mike, “Policy Recommendations,” Toward a True Allicane: Restructuring U.S.-Japan Security Relations, ed. Mike Mochizuki) 
2. Restructure U.S. military forces in Japan by removing … under way provides a good opportunity for Japan to move forward on these matters P. 195-6 

**Failure to reduce the impact of Marine presence in Japan leads to the collapse of the alliance and undermines broader cooperation**
Yamaguchi, Professor at the National Defense Academy of Japan, National Defense Academy of Japan graduate, Master’s from the Fletcher School of Law & Diplmoacy, former Visiting Scholar at the John M. Olin Institute for Strategic Studies at Harvard, form Senior Defense Attache at the Embassy of Japan in the U.S., former Vice Commandant of the Japan Ground Self Defense Force Ground Research & Development Command, & former Deputy Director of the National Institute for Defense Studies, 3-17-10 (Noboru, “Beware Resignation in Washington Toward the Japan-US Alliance,” http://www.tokyofoundation.org/en/articles/2009/beware-resignation-in-washington-toward-the-japan-us-alliance) 
In this context, we must not forget the … stable footing. If this is not done, Japan’s very existence as a state may be altered fundamentally. 

**Failure to shore up the alliance by reducing the presence of Marines collapses the alliance which causes multiple scenarios for nuclear war**
Armitage, former Deputy Secretary of State, 10-11-2K (Richard, “The United States and Japan: Advancing Toward a Mature Partnership,” INSS Special Report, Institute for National Strategic Studies at National Defense University) 
Asia, in the throes of historic change, should carry major weight in the …The United States should consider broader and more flexible deployment and training options for the Marines throughout the region. 

**Independent from decisions regarding the locations of the Third Marine Logistics Group Headquarters, Third Marine Expeditionary Force Command Element, the First Marine Air Wing Headquarters and without mandating the cessation of operations at the Jungle Warfare Training Center at Camp Gonsalves, the United States Department of Defense should implement a policy whereby the number of personnel from III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed in Japan is reduced to approximately 5,000 which should include, but should not necessarily be limited to, the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit as well as Marine Corps personnel tasked with maintaining pre-positioned equipment and access arrangements for the emergency use of Japanese facilities in addition to requisite combat support, combat service support, administration, and logistics elements.**


**Observation Two – Deterrence**

**First, Local political and public opposition means Futenma won’t be relocated – Kan’s inability to get the deal done ensures renewed bilateral tensions and ignites opposition to our other bases**
Ennis, former member of the Council on Foreign Relations task forces regarding Japan, former Research Fellow at Dartmouth’s Dickey Center for International Understanding, long-time analyst of U.S.-Japan relations, U.S. Correspondent for Keekly Tokyo Keizai, founder of The Oriental Economist, 9-12-10 (Peter, “Nago vote dims prospects for Futenma replacement facility on Okinawa,” http://www.dispatchjapan.com/blog/2010/09/nago-vote-dims-prospects-for-futenma-replacement-facility-on-okinawa.html) 
The already-slim prospects for construction in Okinawa …Futenma-Henoko dispute carries on, the more that danger rises. 

**And, Trying to hold onto our Marine presence causes a political backlash that ensures we lose all of our bases – Sacrificing one base now saves 100 in the crunch – The plan doesn’t hurt our deterrence or credibility**
O’Hanlon, Director of Research & Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy at Brookings, Director of Research for the 21st Centry Defense Initiative, 1 (Michael, “Military Readiness & Overseas Commitments,” Defense Policy Choices for the Bush Administration, 2001-2005) 
Not only is the continuous Okinawa presence a major … where they are today, providing more than adequate testimony to the continuing American interest in the region's stability. P. 54-55 

**And, The status quo dispute ensures a political disaster that will cripple support for all of our bases in Japan which are the absolute key to our power projection in Asia**
Ennis, former member of the Council on Foreign Relations task forces regarding Japan, former Research Fellow at Dartmouth’s Dickey Center for International Understanding, long-time analyst of U.S.-Japan relations, U.S. Correspondent for Keekly Tokyo Keizai, founder of The Oriental Economist, 6-8-10 (Peter, “Jeff Bader, Mike Green hit critics of Obama Futenma policy,” Dispatch Japan, http://www.dispatchjapan.com/blog/2010/06/jeff-bader-mike-green-hit-critics-of-obama-futenma-policy.html) 
The exchanges of the last week can’t be dismissed as unwarranted … the issue this way, however, which unfortunately sets the stage down the road for renewed tensions between Washington and Tokyo. 

**And, Failure to move the Marines will rock the alliance and ignite opposition to our other bases in Japan – The plan is the best way to shore up our defense capabilities**
Ennis, former member of the Council on Foreign Relations task forces regarding Japan, former Research Fellow at Dartmouth’s Dickey Center for International Understanding, long-time analyst of U.S.-Japan relations, U.S. Correspondent for Keekly Tokyo Keizai, founder of The Oriental Economist, 8-18-10 (Peter, “Gates and Japan,” Dispatch Japan, http://www.dispatchjapan.com/blog/2010/08/gates-and-japan.html) 
Okinawa is home to the III Marine Expeditionary Force … which now operates from upgraded facilities at the Sasebo naval base in Kyushu. 


**Scenario One – Kadena Air Base**

**Not doing the plan undermines our ability to hold onto Kadena – The plan saves the base without impacting deterrence**
O’Hanlon, Director of Research & Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy at Brookings, Director of Research for the 21st Centry Defense Initiative, 9-2-4 (Michael, before the Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States, http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/osbc/documents/OSBC%20transcript%209-2-04.pdf) 
Second point. Okinawa, Japan -- that Larry …danger, to the U.S.-Japan alliance if we don't reconsider some of that. 

**And, Kadena is categorically more important to deterrence than our Marine presence – The plan is critical to shoring up political support for the base.**
Mochizuki, Ph.D., Japan-U.S. Relations Chair in Memory of Gaston Sigur at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University & O’Hanlon, Director of Research & Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy at Brookings, Director of Research for the 21st Centry Defense Initiative, 1-10 (Mike & Michael, “A proposed compromise on Futenma: The unnecessary crisis,” The Oriental Economist) 
Why have Washington and Tokyo racheted … to let the dispute over Futenma derail a broader positive US-Japan dialogue, particularly on the 50th anniversary of the US Japan Security Treaty. 

**And, Kadena is critical to deterring a China – Taiwan conflict**
Ross, Political Sicence Professor at Boston College & Associate of the John King Fairbank Center for East Asian Studies at Harvard University, 2 (Robert, “Navigating the Tiawan Strait: Deterrance, Escalation Dominance, and US-China Relations, International Security) 
Deterrence could fail if China's leaders believe …advantage to expand cooperation with China and maintain the security of Taiwan.


**The U.S. will get drawn into the conflict – It escalates globally and causes nuclear war**
Hunkovic, of the American Military University, 9 (Lee, “The Chinese-Taiwanese Conflict: Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan, and the United States,” American Military University Course Paper, http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/Hunkovic.pdf) 
World News Connection (2006) then addresses American responses to each scenario, which notably vary. They conclude that all three scenarios suppose a situation in which the U.S. will be unavoidably involved in the …However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study. 

**It destroys civilization**
Cheong, East Asia Correspondent for the Straits Times, 6-25-2K (Ching, “No one gains in war over Taiwan,” The Straits Times (Singapore)) 
THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war …There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else. 


**Scenario Two – Yokosuka Naval Base**

**Failure to do the plan puts fatal stress on the alliance – We’d lose our ability to station an aircraft carrier in Japan which militarialy isolates Japan and undercuts our credibility in Asia**
Auslin, Director of Japan Studies at the American Enterprise Institute & former History Professor & Senior Research Fellow at the MacMilan Center for Interantation & Area Studes at Yale, 6-16-10 (Micahel, “The Real Futenma Fallout,” Wall Street Journal Asia, http://www.aei.org/article/102196) 
A great sigh of relief erupted in Washington and Tokyo Friday … Whether politicians on both sides of the Pacific are willing to follow them, however, is another matter. 

**And, Carrier-based deterrence maintains world peace - It prevents inevitable brushfires from becoming global conflagrations**
Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations, & General Krulak, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, 97 (Jay & Charles, “Forward Presence is Essential to American Interests,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://www.milnet.com/pentagon/navy/fwdpresn.htm]]</span>) 
Also this morning, United States Navy amphibious assault ships carrying 4,400 … Forward presence makes it — and will keep it — the right force, tailor-made for these uncertain and sometimes fiery times. 

**Losing Yokosuka crushes our ability to project naval power globally – Collapses our hegemony**
Kazuhisa, Analyst of International Politics and Military Security issues, 99 (Ogawa, “Substantive Debate Needed on Defense Partnership, Japan Quarterly, July – September, Volume 46, Number 3) 
The truth cannot be more different from this … I convinced Japanese government leaders of the significance of the Americans' agreement. 

**Global WMD wars**
Gray, director of the Centre for Strategic Studies and professor of International Relations and Strategic Studies at the University of Reading, graduate of the Universities of Manchester and Oxford, Founder and Senior Associate to the National Institute for Public Policy, formerly with the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the Hudson Institute, 4 (Colin, “The Sheriff: America’s Defense of the New World Order, pg. 6-10) 
Every condition of international order works for the particular benefit of some countries and the … and South and East Asia are as likely to provoke as to cool conflict – and conflict with weapons of mass destruction (WMD) at that.

Contention One: Our Enemies
First, U.S. foreign policy is increasingly defined by the pursuit of a totalizing world order of Empire. Military bases provide the capacity needed to enforce the annihilation of liberalism’s allegedly “inhuman” opponents
