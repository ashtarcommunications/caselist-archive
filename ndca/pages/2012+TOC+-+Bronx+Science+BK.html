ORS funding increased to $25 million but its future is uncertain<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Smith 04/26</span> is the founder and editor of SpacePolicyOnline.com and President of Space and Technology Policy Group, LLC (2012, Marcia S, “HASC Subcommittee Rescues ORS, Denies Advanced Appropriations for SBIRS” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/news/hasc-subcommittee-rescues-ors-denies-advanced-appropriations-for" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/news/hasc-subcommittee-rescues-ors-denies-advanced-appropriations-for</a> sbirs?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Spacepolicyonline+%28SpacePolicyOnline+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher, accessed 04/27, abs)<br />
<br />
In less than 5 minutes today, the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) approved the subcommittee's recommendations for its portion of the FY2013 defense authorization act. <span class="Underline">One of those recommendations is to preserve the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) program, which the Department of Defense (DOD) wants to dissolve.</span> The draft bill also denies DOD's request for advance appropriations as part of its Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) strategy, and restricts spending for launch vehicles until the Air Force submits an associated acquisition plan. <span class="Underline">The various HASC subcommittees are marking up their portions of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act</span> (NDAA, H.R. 4310 ) today and tomorrow. The Strategic Forces subcommittee has jurisdiction over most DOD space activities. HASC has a special section of its website with the bill and report language recommended by each of the subcommittees and video of the markups. <span class="Underline">The Strategic Forces subcommittee denied DOD's request to dissolve the ORS program office and integrate the ORS concept into other parts of the Air Force space program.</span> ORS was created in the FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act to demonstrate the ability to build and launch small specialized satellites quickly to respond to the needs of joint commanders<span class="Underline">. The committee rejected DOD's request to repeal that section of the law, denied the $10 million DOD requested over five different budget accounts to integrate ORS into its other activities, and added $25 million to continue the ORS program.</span><br />
<br />
A stable, predictable funding stream is vital to ORS technology development and commitment<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dinerman, 6</span> – DOD space consultant, and senior editor at the Hudson Institute’s New York branch (Taylor, The Space Review, “Tactical IR satellites: operationally responsive spacecraft?,” 8/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/675/1</a><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The </span>troops on the ground need information they can use in a timely and easily understood format<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Simply to provide them, or division or brigade intelligence staffs that support them, with raw satellite data is probably worse than useless. </span>The next generations of US Army and Marine Corps units are going to require information that can be integrated into their “network-centric” information systems<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Imagery from space-based infrared sensors that are specifically designed for tactical utility should be part of these networks.<br />
This is a mission for a future constellation of small “operationally responsive” satellites.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Part of the constellation should be kept in orbits that take them over places such as south Lebanon or the Afghan-Pakistani border where we can assume that there will be trouble for a long time to come. These should be carefully calibrated on a constant basis, so that their positioning information is ultra-precise. Other satellites can be kept on the ground ready to be launched at relatively short notice to supplement the ones on orbit over the world’s trouble spots, or they could be launched to cover unexpected outbreaks of fighting.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A model for the way such a program could be run is GPS, which, over almost three decades, has gone from prototypes to sets of more and more sophisticated and capable satellites. These spacecraft have, on the whole, been both cost effective and free of the kinds of nasty and expensive surprises that have plagued SBIRS and other Air Force satellite programs.</span><br />
An operationally responsive tactical IR satellite system would have to be both affordable and based on proven and reliable technology. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The first generation of such satellites may not have all the desired features, but if properly designed—with the right filters and the right level of multi- or hyper-spectral sensitivity—such craft would give the ground forces a valuable early operational capability.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To make the program affordable it would have to be designed to use already existing bus and power supply systems and probably also an in-service communications architecture. </span>It would have to be light enough to be launched on a Delta 2 or on a future operationally responsive spacelift vehicle. Most important of all, the funding stream<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>no matter how much or how little—would have to be predictable so that the contractors would have the incentive to plan for the long term<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This would be the most difficult part of the program since it would mean asking Congress to give up part of its power over the annual budget cycle.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Another way to keep the program affordable would be to keep the early requirements to a minimum. The first versions should be strictly for ground force use only, with perhaps some applications for Marine Corps amphibious warfare requirements. Only after the system has proven itself should the program be allowed to move on to develop air-to-ground sensor-to-shooter loops.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Ultimately a constellation of a dozen or so spacecraft in orbit, backed up by a similar number on the ground, would be ideal for the early versions of the full system. The ground segments will have to be as simple and as inexpensive as possible since it will need to be deployed with more than fifty Army and Marine brigade-sized units as well as with higher headquarters.</span><br />
If the idea of operationally responsive space means anything, it means that the military space forces<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, particularly Air Force Space Command, </span>are ready to give priority to supporting the troops on the front lines worldwide. Enhancing the combat effectiveness of the Army and the Marines and helping to save American lives should be the highest goal<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Clausewitz put it, “The object of fighting is the destruction or defeat of the enemy.” </span>The more that military space contributes directly to that objective, the better for the troops on the ground and for America as a whole.<br />
<br />
ORS is inevitable – other space powers will do it if the US doesn’t<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Wertz, 8 </span>- president of Microcosm, a space technology small business in Los Angeles, and the general chairman for the first five Responsive Space Conferences (James, “It’s time to get our ORS in gear,” The Space Review, 1/7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1032/1</a>)<br />
<br />
Can the US overcome bureaucratic impediments in order to make it happen?<br />
Here we would have to say that no one knows. It may or may not occur for all of the reasons that Dwayne Day has clearly pointed out. The need for ORS has been formalized for some years in the <em>Operationally Responsive Spacelift Mission Need Statement</em> (ORS MNS) of December 20, 2001. But that does not mean that it will actually come about. There are a variety of entrenched interests and organizational sandboxes arrayed against ORS, or trying to reshape it in their own image. This is, of course, the same process that has brought us $32 billion in cost overruns in the ten largest DoD space programs according to a 2007 <em>Aviation Week</em> article. We would have to conclude that the odds of success are slim, but not zero. In many past technology developments, it has been Congress that has made things happen. That may or may not occur here.<br />
One thing seems clear: if ORS doesn’t happen in the US, it will certainly happen elsewhere. According to a DoD 2007 assessment, the Chinese have already announced a near-term goal of launching satellites within hours of demand. The Russians have been able to do so for years. The Europeans are well ahead of the US in a formalized process for creating low-cost space missions. The rest of the world will move ahead with the capability to respond rapidly to changing world events, irrespective of whether the US chooses to do so.<br />

Space assets are vulnerable- makes attacks inev<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Rendleman, 10</span> –[ Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science]<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The 11 January 2007 test of a Chinese ground-based, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) kinetic-kill interceptor against one of their own defunct weather satellites generated considerable angst across the United States space community. </span>The 2007 test demonstrated that the importance of space capabilities is also their Achilles heel, that is, their deadly weakness in spite of overall strength; it is far too easy to neutralize space systems and their power<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. In the broad strategic context, </span>space capabilities have their own set of unique, inherent vulnerabilities<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, which are largely the result of orbital mechanics. </span>This invites destruction, damage, and even just mischief delivered by even the least significant adversary<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. However, other nations may seek to deny U.S. advantages in space through a variety of negation and prevention actions.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Negation Threats</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Satellite systems consist not only of spacecraft, each with their own payload and bus, but also a supporting infrastructure—ground control stations, tracking and control links, commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&amp;C) links, data links, launch facilities, and an industrial base. Each of these components is at risk to threats of physical and cyber attack, and sabotage, and can be negated, simultaneously or each in detail. The satellite payload, bus, links, and infrastructure can be negated by using a variety of permanent or reversible means to achieve one of the five possible effects, known as the ‘‘five Ds’’—deception, disruption, denial, degradation, and destruction.5</span><br />
Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and access to the space domain. There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. </span><span style="font-size: 3pt;">Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologies. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">In sum, there is a wide span of kinetic and other types of attacks an adversary could consider and employ. There is potential that even non-state actors can access some of these technologies and space systems, and achieve several of the five Ds; however, it is unlikely they can obtain and then employ a full-spectrum of these means and achieve all of these effects. Conducting an attack within the space domain involves a rather substantial investment to develop, acquire, operate, and sustain needed shooter, sensor, and command and control systems. Given the scope and commitment needed to affect such a move, an on-orbit attack would probably be made only in the context of a larger strategic struggle, perhaps as a prelude to or part of early combat operations. On the other hand, inexpensive jamming technology is available to even the poorest potential adversaries. As such, jamming poses the most used and growing threat to space systems. Some argue that jamming also carries with it implicit political and legal sanctions since no major space power has moved to ban or make even temporary and reversible jamming illegal. This may change now that a number of nations have banned together to object to recent Iranian satellite jamming.6 Cyber adversaries and criminals are also beginning to hone their craft. They present an evolving threat to space systems; and like jamming, cyber threats can be developed and deployed for only modest investments.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention Threats</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention actions generally involve economic, political, informational, and diplomatic instruments of national power. For example, an extremely large creditor nation could employ its considerable economic clout and leverage in an attempt to compel or blackmail the United States to not license or permit imaging of its territory, preventing its use, and reducing its exposure to such observation. The creditor nation could seek to accomplish its objective by destabilizing the world market place. It could refuse to purchase treasury offerings that underpin the burgeoning U.S. fiscal and trade deficits, perhaps arguing that remote sensing, especially commercial remote sensing, of its territory infringes on its territorial and sovereign rights, or that it constitutes ‘‘unlawful’’ industrial espionage, and is thus, an unfair trade practice.7 Commercial remote sensing systems are nowan important resource for the United States Government and its national security needs. U.S. Government orders help sustain and stabilize the remote sensing industry,8 and any limitations on activities, whether for U.S. Government customers or commercial ones, imposed in response to external economic threats could evolve to cause problems. In an alternative scenario, a state, acting through political allies and proxies, could exert considerable influence and dominance to affect a change in U.S. law. This change could restrict licensing of commercial remote sensing imagery, restricting the market place and impacting business models for producers.9</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">As a diplomatic prevention example, adversaries could attempt to use international forums and treaties to deny frequency rights needed by U.S. military or intelligence satellites by making spurious ‘‘paper satellite’’ filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ‘‘Paper satellites’’ involve ITU applications for satellite orbital slots, many for ‘‘speculative’’ systems that will never leave Earth. These filings can block access to scarce spectrum and orbital resources.10 The ability to place communications and other satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) positions could be held at risk. Some characterize some of these types of actions as a form of ‘‘lawfare.’’ ‘‘The term lawfare describes the growing use of international law claims, usually factually or legally meritless, as a tool of war. The goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion, and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals.’’11</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Prevention actions taken to hobble U.S. space systems are not armed attacks. As is discussed later, the use of force is only authorized under the United Nations (UN) Charter in response to an armed attack, or upon authorization of the UN Security Council. As such, using armed force to deter and defeat prevention actions involving political or diplomatic subterfuge or intrigue may be unlawful under international law. Creative alternative solutions must therefore be found to assure access to space when facing these types of threats.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">Implications for U.S. Space Strategy</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 3pt;">The wide span of threats poses profound implications</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> for U.S. space strategy and its execution. First, unlike the Cold War era, </span>the U<span style="font-size: 5pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">tates </span>now confronts a wide array of global actors, all operating with different motivations and incentives, some of which could become potential adversaries who can attack or threaten space capabilities<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. These state and non-state adversaries exhibit a wide array of political, economic, technical, and social differences. </span>Having many potential adversaries makes each of them harder to understand. This complicates efforts to understand motivations and to influence perceptions for deterrence purposes<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>These differences, in turn, increase the likelihood of misperception, undercutting strategies to protect access to space capabilities. When one’s attention is divided, deterrent measures that are appropriate for one target may not be useful, or even counterproductive, for another<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. This requires tailored intelligence efforts, information operations, and transparency efforts in order to avoid or minimize disputes and prevent problems.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Second, the broad array of adversaries exhibit widely varying risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behavior can strongly influence an adversary’s perception of a situation. Understanding this phenomenon can lead to better ways of influencing those perceptions. Unfortunately, </span>potential adversaries may not care that space systems offer tremendous value and capabilities to all nations, or care whether conflict in space could create space debris that could cost all nations access to the domain. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">A strategy to assure continuing access to space assets must therefore be sufficiently flexible to address both risk-averse and risk-taking adversaries. Indeed, potential adversaries may shift from risk-taking to risk-adverse over a relatively short period of time. China may fit in this category. Within a decade or two, it will have its own extensive space-based communications, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellite constellations, all of which will be integrated into its military operations. No doubt, China will embrace that evolution and become very reliant on space capabilities; this will shift it from an asymmetric competitor to one similar to the United States or Russia. Third, with the demise of the Soviet Union, some political commentators and critics described the United States as a ‘‘hyperpower’’ not just a ‘‘superpower.’’ 12 Though buffeted by recent events involving Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and the 2008 global financial meltdown, U.S. military supremacy continues. But, that </span>supremacy does not make or guarantee a successful space strategy.Adversaries may believe they have a higher stake than the United States in the outcome of a particular crisis or conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>Alternatively, the United States stake in the crisis may not be commensurate with the possible cost of involvement by the United States military and the rest of its national security apparatus. The first alternative may encourage mischief by adversaries; the second discourages U.S. action. As a result, adversaries may find threats of U.S. action in response to hostile acts affecting U.S. access to space systems to be non-credible<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Fourth, </span>while the United States has produced superlative space capabilities, it has not produced enough systems ready to survive the new kinetic, exotic, jamming, and cyber threat environment<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The vulnerability exists because the spacecraft developed and deployed today are in many ways the same as those originally fielded during the Cold War. During that epic struggle, there was a tacit and then explicit understanding that each superpower would not attack and overwhelm the other’s space systems, except in the direst of circumstances, perhaps during the throes of a nuclear conflagration. Indeed, a number of agreements between the superpowers adopted the understanding and ruled out interference with national technical means, including space assets. </span>This belief in the superiority of space systems and power blinds the United States to the inherent strategic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in these systems. This, predictably, can now be exploited by potential adversaries, such as China, who, with their recent ASAT test, appear more willing to fully explore the technologies needed to expand the limits of conventional war to include the space domain<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Consequently, by historically and diplomatically reducing the threat, engineering of some satellite threat detection, attack avoidance, and other defense subsystems have not matured enough so that they are sophisticated, nimble, and robust enough to counter new 21st Century adversary attack capabilities.</span><br />

China has the intent to attack<br />

AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.77 </span>These include<span style="font-size: 5pt;">: . </span>satellite jamming technology; . collisions between space bodies; . kinetic energy weapons; . space-to-ground attack weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">; </span>. space planes<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space; . </span>high-power laser weapons<span style="font-size: 5pt;">; . </span>high-power microwave weapon systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">; . </span>particle-beam weapons; and<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>electromagnetic pulse<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.78 PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, </span>it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 </span>The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.81 One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. </span>As the PLA modernizes its<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (</span>C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, </span>an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. For example, </span>four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, in Wuhan, </span>have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85 In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88 </span>The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research. Space Deterrence Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems. In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability. Conclusions There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, </span>in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA. U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. </span>There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims<span style="font-size: 5pt;">;97 </span>the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory. The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. </span>The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. </span>No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures. </span>Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. </span>As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, </span>and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict<span style="font-size: 5pt;">.</span><br />

Military space missions Little is known about the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) actual capability to wage war in space. What has been demonstrated, however, including the 2007 ASAT<span style="color: green;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/2" rel="nofollow">test</a></span>and reports of China blinding US intelligence satellites, has caused much consternation across the world. One aspect of Chinese military aspirations in space that has been studied is the internal publications of the PLA and its stated views on space doctrine. Increasingly, these writings have accepted the inevitability of the weaponization of space and called for appropriate preparations to be made to successfully wage war in space. Given the dual-use nature of most space technology, it is no surprise that China’s military uses of space are advancing commensurately with its civilian and commercial programs. First of all, China is widely known to have an array of intelligence satellites for space reconnaissance and surveillance. The Ziyuan Earth observation satellite is known to be one of these, but China has also fielded the Fanhui Shi Weixing, or Retrievable Satellite, which drops canisters of film from space.15 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">China’s ongoing microsatellite program has sparked some of the most concern abroad. Aside from intelligence satellites, microsatellites have many potential offensive uses such as maneuvering in range of an adversary’s satellite and either latching on—a “parasitic microsat”—to disrupt proper functions, or merely exploding within range of a target satellite to destroy it. Furthermore, the ability to deploy a constellation of microsatellites on short notice, a capability China may already possess with its Kaituozhe launch<span style="color: green;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1958/2" rel="nofollow">vehicle</a></span>, denies the deterrence factor that could otherwise prevent offensive attacks on an adversary’s space assets for fear of retaliation.</span> China’s rocket technology also has proven offensive military use in space: the ability to shoot down enemy assets in space through direct ascent attacks. China demonstrated such ability in 2007, which has been the impetus for much of the recent speculation about China’s military space aspirations. Despite political blowback from this test (it resulted in a 20 percent increase in the total amount of trackable space debris in low Earth orbit), China may still be pursuing ASAT technologies.16In January 2010 China conducted a successful test of its ground-based midcourse missile interception technology. This test used technology similar to its 2007 ASAT test and, as exemplified by the US Navy-led Operation Burnt Frost that intercepted the satellite USA 193, missile defense technology can serve ASAT ends. In addition to these hard-kill capabilities, China has the capability to use soft-kill measures to neutralize adversary’s space assets. China is known to have the means to jam satellite communication and GPS receivers and is developing directed energy ASATs, including high-powered microwave and particle beam weapons.17The US Department of Defense (DoD), in their annual report to Congress on China’s military modernization, also notes that China is developing ground-based laser ASATs, the beginnings of which may have already been demonstrated. In 2006 the director of the National Reconnaissance Office, Donald Kerr, substantiated reports that China used a ground-based laser to dazzle a US spy satellite over its territory. Although this laser could not do any long-term damage, similar techniques and capabilities used to track and dazzle this satellite could be coupled with more powerful ground-based lasers to destroy space assets. Some reports actually indicate China has already tested and deployed a ground-based ASAT laser that can target assets in LEO.18 Despite the array of activity the PLA conducts in and through space, they seem to lack a specific doctrine for the employment of their space capabilities and have not made public any substantial plans for military uses of space. In lieu of a formal declaration on space, there is a growing literature from within the PLA ranks that may be forming the basis for what later becomes stated—or unstated—PLA space doctrine. These authors generally hold the same assumptions about space, including the inevitability that space will be a domain of war in the future.19Many also acknowledge that establishing space dominance will be crucial to fully exploiting wartime necessities such as control of airspace and secure command and control.20 Three internal Chinese sources are largely cited as being the defining PLA space doctrine writings:<em>Space War</em>by Colonel Li Daguang;<em>On Space Operations</em>by Colonel Jia Junming; and<em>Joint Space War Campaigns</em>by Colonel Yuan Zelu.21Colonel Li highlights many specific recommendations to develop the PLA’s space fighting capabilities, including fielding offensive capabilities capable of “destroying or temporarily incapacitating all enemy space vehicles that fly in space above our sovereign territory.” Other recommendations include focusing development on land-based anti-satellite weapons and anti-satellite satellites as well as “assassin’s mace” space weapons that could deal a crippling blow to an enemy. Particularly important to foreign perceptions of China, these writings also call for China to combine military and civilian technology and integrate peacetime and wartime facilities. Other authors on the subject promote such actions as: fielding sea-launched anti-satellite weapons, attacking GPS with high energy laser weapons, fielding stealthy space satellites and weapons, and seeking the ability to attack terrestrial targets from space. Kevin Pollpeter, summing up the view of most Chinese authors writing on the subject, writes, “The development of space technology will inevitably lead to the militarization of space and space militarization will lead to confrontation in space. As the struggle over air and space control is becoming the new focal point of war, space will become the main battlefield of future wars.”22Pollpeter also notes that throughout his extensive review of Chinese space writings, there were no rebuttals to the view that China will inevitability develop and use counterspace weapons. These views also seem to be held by some in the upper echelons of the PLA. In November 2009, PLA Air Force (PLAAF) commander Xu Qiliang stated in an interview with the PLA Daily newspaper, an official government publication, that the militarization of space is a “historical inevitability” and called on the PLAAF to develop offensive and defensive capabilities in space.23Xu is not only the head of the PLAAF, but as of 2007 was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (CCCP) and a member of the Central Military Commission (CMC)—two primary policy decision making bodies in China. The Foreign Ministry tried to backtrack on Xu’s comments days later by reiterating that China has “all along upheld the peaceful use of outer space,” and would not be part of a space arms race.24However, Xu did not personally retract his statements and, given his elite government position, this interview could actually be exemplary of how some of China’s top official’s views space. Indeed, there is some indication the CCCP acknowledges the need to prepare for the weaponization of space. In December 2010, the official publication of the CCCP, the Qiushi Journal, on its website released an article that spoke to China’s perspectives on space war: China's missiles can directly attack the military satellites, which usually orbit at an altitude less than 10,000 kilometers...China should make efforts to develop space weapons as soon as possible, as this is the most effective military means of attacking the U.S. If we can eventually fire missiles from a satellite, the U.S. will find that it has nowhere to hide; it will find itself entirely exposed to the attack radius of Chinese weaponry…Vigorously strengthening the building of our space military forces should be not only the focus of our national defense, but also the most powerful weapon to deter U.S. military blackmail.25 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">After the article was translated into English, the original Chinese version was altered to state that the views were those of the authors only. In a society well versed in controlling media and hiding military intentions,</span> it is interesting the Chinese government is allowing these and other perspectives to be published containing such inflammatory language on space warfare. This suggests that perhaps the views are not condemned or are being floated as trial balloons to gauge foreign response.<br />
<br />
PLA is isolated from the Chinese govt<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">MacDonald, 11</span> - Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis)<br />
<br />
One characteristic of too many wars in the last century is that they are the result of miscalculation that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, </span>the PLA's senior officer corps<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. This means that the PLA overall </span>views world events from a less knowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted their 2007 ASAT test.<br />
<br />
This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government, and reports only to the Central Military Commission,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. government. Normally this would not be too great a concern, but </span>in a crisis this could be dangerous. Add to this the fact that China has no equivalent of our National Security Council, a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
In a crisis, the PLA probably cannot be counted on to show as sophisticated a sense of judgment as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these problems and many more pose potential threats to internal political stability andCommunist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space</span><br />
<br />
Space assets<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, </span>are the means by which essential national security information is either generated, transmitted, or both. This information is the lifeblood of U.S. conventional military superiority and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As such, </span>these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and their relative vulnerability can provide dangerously attractive incentives in a crisis to preempt, escalating to war<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise: </span>going first in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary appears to offer many advantages, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems. Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. </span>The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management.</span><br />
<br />
There is an inherent risk of strategic instability when relatively modest defense efforts create disproportionate danger to an adversary, as with<br />
space offense. And there is a serious risk of crisis instability in space when &quot;going first&quot; pays off<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> - destroying an adversary's satellites before he destroys yours. We don't know what would happen in a crisis, but </span>the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.<br />

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Burke, 6</span> – Lt Col, USAF, command space professional with operational experience in missile operations, space surveillance, space control, missile warning, and command and control (Alan, “SPACE THREAT WARNING: FOUNDATION FOR SPACE SUPERIORITY, AVOIDING A SPACE PEARL HARBOR,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.afresearch.org/skins/RIMS/display.aspx?moduleid=be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153&amp;mode=user&amp;action=researchproject&amp;objectid=07acf878-3a5f-4a2c-8259-4a34c0717e9b" rel="nofollow">https://www.afresearch.org/skins/RIMS/display.aspx?moduleid=be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153&amp;mode=user&amp;action=researchproject&amp;objectid=07acf878-3a5f-4a2c-8259-4a34c0717e9b</a>)<br />
<br />
The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites<span style="font-size: 9pt;">, facilities or services; </span>the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets.<br />
One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> on the US homeland or an attack </span>that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, </span>other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US<span style="font-size: 9pt;">.44</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">Although a major attack on the US is not likely, </span>the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculationthat the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike<span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span>The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, </span>the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a <em>fait accompli</em><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.45</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “</span>Space capabilities<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> are no longer nice to have, but </span>are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.”51 </span>The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets.<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, </span>successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. </span>A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability.<br />
The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Today, </span>other nations are working to developnew weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—</span>informationwar<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The current </span>coverage gaps in our space surveillance network<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset </span>makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons <span style="font-size: 6pt;">without our knowledge.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Finally, </span>without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to counter an attack against US space assets</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is </span>to deter an attack on US space assets<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. </span>A senior officer in US Strat<span style="font-size: 6pt;">egic </span>Com<span style="font-size: 6pt;">mand recently </span>stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.57 </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Marshall, 8</span> - NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A<br />
MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (1) the U.S. military space systems—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligence; and (2) space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’’1 Whether one agrees with the tone, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3<br />
The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world.<br />
Importance of Space Assets<br />
For better or worse, it is clear that the U.S. military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. These satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. First, the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and signals intelligence from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack. As Gray classified, space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military over the last decade.5<br />
Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to being catastrophic to U.S. security. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. The latter scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability from normal operations. In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go the way of all great powers — down. The individual dramas of the past decade — the September 2001 terrorist attacks, prolonged wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis — have delivered the world a message: US primacy is in decline. This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts. However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid. As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. Free </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973)</span><span class="BoldUnderline">. A world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge, the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one, and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy. </span><br />

Commitment to ORS is vital to eterrence by denial – it will prevent attacks against US space assets<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sejba, 10</span> - USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “ Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The space domain,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often referred to as “The High Frontier,” </span>no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is now time to take actions for the </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">sake of space</span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. </span>Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 </span>Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Operationally responsive space (ORS) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">assured </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So </span>while ORS intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter, its true value will be the assurance it provides as a credible strategic <em>deterrent</em> against space attacks.<br />
As a deterrent, ORS provides access to existing capabilities, or rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities, denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Through timely and accurate intelligence, we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, </span>ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations.</span><br />
Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space. In fact, </span>a deterrence strategy that includes the threat of punishment<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy; a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy </span>is not directly applicable to space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.6</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space.</span><br />
Instead,deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries (against their most prized assets<span style="font-size: 8pt;">);9 </span>and encourage their restraint<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
A New Focus of Deterrence<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">What does deterrence look like in the 21</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">st </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Sandra I. Erwin, </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Future of War—How the Game is Changing</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ US National Security Strategy, 2006</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. </span>Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations even in a contested environment.<br />
Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space: Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict.</span></em><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12</span><br />
The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS capabilities is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Instead, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “</span>our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”14</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Moving forward, </span>to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). </span>Tier 1 and Two ORS capabilities can be deployed and employed rapidly, within hours to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<span class="BoldUnderline">The U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="BoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span class="BoldUnderline">has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that </span><span class="BoldUnderline">efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ,,39 Further, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">the DoD's Plan for Operationally Responsive Space highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , </span><span class="BoldUnderline">ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="BoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span class="BoldUnderline">must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Although the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="BoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span class="BoldUnderline">maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (SSN) network, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">;</span><span class="BoldUnderline"> the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> February 10, 2009 </span><span class="BoldUnderline">collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Improved SSA also allows the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="BoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span class="BoldUnderline">to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These </span><span class="BoldUnderline">orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="BoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span class="BoldUnderline">enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability </span><span class="BoldUnderline">The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites </span><span class="BoldUnderline">The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency </span><span class="BoldUnderline">The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Engagement </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic· missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.53 </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “</span><span class="BoldUnderline">A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations </span><span class="BoldUnderline">The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Satellites with Space Maritime Tracking Capability are a relatively new technology</span>. The research was started by academic institutions and today is available commercially, primarily in the applications of space maritime tracking of merchant vessels around coastal waters and in the primary sea lines of communications (e.g. Gibraltar). In the next pages we present all the available commercial small satellite applications that are in orbit or under construction and in the near future they are going to be used for space maritime tracking. <span class="Underline">It turns out that there are not so many “people” around the world that are using or trying to apply this technology and even more we did not manage to find out any organizations or small satellite applications on orbit or under construction that are dealing with the tracking of merchant vessels that are maybe transferring or carrying illicit cargo, in our case WMD</span> (radioactive or biological) materials. Then Naval Postgraduate School small satellite MIO Testbed/experiment is going to be a unique application on this subject area and we hope that at the end we will provide solutions that will be unrivalled throughout the world. Of course, all the above should happen with the use of Pico satellite technology which is in our case will be the Tubesat satellite.<br />

The 2006 DoD annual report argued that the <span class="Underline">acquisition and development of new submarines “illustrate[d] the importance the PLA is placing on undersea warfare in its pursuit of sea denial</span>.”33 The 2008 report reiterated this concern, arguing that the <span class="Underline">increased presence of advanced submarines “reflect[s] Beijing’s desire to protect and advance its maritime interests up to and beyond the second island chain.”34 Many members of the U.S. Congress have also expressed concern regarding China’s modernization of its submarine fleet,</span> including Senator Jim Webb (VA) and Representative Duncan Hunter (CA–52nd Dist.).35 In March 2007, Jane’s Navy International reported that the Yuan<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span>class submarine hulls were rumored to have air<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span>independent propulsion (AIP) capability. <span class="Underline">AIP capability allows a diesel</span><span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span><span class="Underline">propulsion submarine to remain submerged for up to several weeks, decreasing its chances of detection.</span>36 In 2009, both the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) as well as the 2009 DoD annual report on China speculated that the <span class="Underline">Yuan</span><span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span><span class="Underline">class could be equipped with an AIP system</span>.37 The full extent of AIP system integration into the Yuan<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span>class submarine fleet is unknown.

<span class="Underline">DOD and other observers also believe that China’s</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> military modernization effort, including its </span><span class="Underline">naval modernization effort, is increasingly oriented toward pursuing additional goals not directly related to Taiwan, including</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the following: • asserting or </span><span class="Underline">defending China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea and East China Sea</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—claims that overlap with those of other countries and, </span><span class="Underline">in the case of the South China Sea, are somewhat ambiguous but potentially expansive enough to go well beyond what would normally be supported by international legal norms relating to territorial waters</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; • enforcing China’s view—a minority but growing view among world nations— that it has the legal right to regulate foreign military activities in its 200-mile maritime exclusive economic zone (EEZ); • protecting China’s sea lines of communications, including those running through the Indian Ocean to the Persian Gulf, on which China relies for much of its energy imports; • protecting and evacuating Chinese nationals living and working in foreign countries; • </span><span class="Underline">displacing U.S. influence in the Pacific</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span><span class="Underline">and • asserting China’s status as a major world power</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.17 The above goals not directly related to Taiwan are potentially significant for at least five reasons: • First, </span><span class="Underline">they imply that if the situation with Taiwan were somehow resolved, China could find continuing reasons to pursue its naval modernization effort</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. • Second, they suggest that if China completes its planned buildup of Taiwan- related naval force elements, or </span><span class="Underline">if the situation with Taiwan were somehow resolved, the composition of China’s naval modernization effort could shift to include a greater emphasis on naval force elements that would be appropriate for supporting additional goals not directly related to Taiwan, such as aircraft carriers, a larger number of nuclear-powered attack submarines, serial production of destroyers,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> larger amphibious ships, underway replenishment ships, hospital ships, and overseas bases or support facilities. Some observers believe a shift to a greater emphasis on naval force elements of this kind has already occurred.18 • Third, </span><span class="Underline">they suggest that China’s maritime territorial claims have the potential for acting as a continuing cause of friction or tension in U.S.-Chinese relations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. • Fourth, </span><span class="Underline">they suggest that China’s view that it has the legal right to regulate foreign military activities in its EEZ has the potential for acting as an ongoing source of potential incidents between U.S. and Chinese ships and aircraft in international waters and airspace close to China</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. • Fifth, they suggest that </span><span class="Underline">in the absence of conflict, China’s military forces, including in particular its naval forces, will be used on a day-to-day basis to promote China’s political position in the Pacific</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline">This would create an essentially political (as opposed to combat-related) reason for the United States or other countries to maintain a competitive presence in the region with naval and other forces that are viewed by observers in the Pacific as capable of effectively countering China’s forces</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even if a U.S.-Chinese military conflict in the Pacific over Taiwan or some other issue were never to occur, the U.S.-Chinese military balance in the Pacific could nevertheless influence day-to-day choices made by other Pacific countries, including choices on whether to align their policies more closely with China or the United States. In this sense, </span><span class="Underline">decisions that Congress and the executive branch make regarding U.S. Navy programs for countering improved Chinese maritime military forces could influence the political evolution of the Pacific, which in turn could affect the ability of the United States to pursue goals relating to various policy issues, both in the Pacific and elsewhere. </span><br />

&quot;The GFO challenge was to deliver a sophisticated altimeter system at relatively low cost,&quot; explained Navy Lt. Cmdr. Therese Moore, the METOC space project manager at the Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Information Operations Program Office (PMW 180). &quot;<span class="Underline">The small satellite approach has exceeded Navy's expectations</span>. GFO data have proven <span class="Underline">critical to the Navy's characterization of the ocean needed for battlespace awareness. Although the satellite is starting to show its age, it continues to operate beyond its design life</span>.&quot; GFO provides considerable &quot;bang for the buck&quot; when compared to many commercial and government satellite programs. GFO's total on-orbit cost was $85 million, which included development, building the satellite, testing and launch. PMW 180, which reports to the Navy's Program Executive Office (PEO) for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence and Space, was responsible for the satellite's procurement. The GFO transmits precise oceanographic information directly to Navy ships at sea and shore-based facilities. This <span class="Underline">small satellite was designed to enhance environmental modeling and effectiveness of weapon and sensor systems. Utilizing a space-borne altimeter, </span>the GFO provides a highly efficient method<span class="Underline"> for collecting the necessary information to support environmental predictions and to enhance warfighting capability.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Despite the country's struggling economy and vocal opposition to some of his policies, President </span><u>Obama's favorability rating is at an all-time high.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Two-thirds feel hopeful about his leadership and six in 10 approve of the job he's doing in the White House.</span><br />
<u>&quot;What is amazing here is how much political capital Obama has spent in the first six weeks,&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> said Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff. </span><u>&quot;And against that, he stands at the end of this six weeks with as much or more capital in the bank.&quot;</u><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Peter Hart gets at a key point. </span><u>Some believe that political capital is finite</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, that it can be used up. To an extent that's true. But it's important to note, too, that </span><u>political capital can be regenerated -- and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, specifically, that </span><u>when a President expends a great deal of capital on a measure that was difficult to enact and then succeeds, he can build up more capital.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Indeed, that appears to be what is happening with Barack </span><u>Obama</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, who </span><u>went to the mat to pass the stimulus package out of the gate, got it passed despite near-unanimous opposition of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u>Republicans</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on Capitol Hill, </span><u>and is being rewarded by the American public as a result.</u> <br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Take a look at the numbers. President Obama now has a 68 percent favorable rating in the NBC-WSJ poll, his highest ever showing in the survey. Nearly half of those surveyed (47 percent) view him very positively. Obama's Democratic Party earns a respectable 49 percent favorable rating. The Republican Party, however, is in the toilet, with its worst ever showing in the history of the NBC-WSJ poll, 26 percent favorable. On the question of blame for the partisanship in Washington, 56 percent place the onus on the Bush administration and another 41 percent place it on Congressional Republicans. Yet just 24 percent blame Congressional Democrats, and a mere 11 percent blame the Obama administration.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">So at this point, </span><u>with</u><u>President Obama seemingly benefiting from his ambitious actions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the Republicans sinking further and further as a result of their knee-jerked opposition to that agenda, </span><u>there appears to be no reason not to push forward on</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> anything from universal healthcare to </span><u>energy reform</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to ending the war in Iraq.</span><br />

 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Charap ‘11</span> (3/11/11, Samuel, Associate Director for Russia and Eurasia and a member of the National Security and International Policy team at the Center for American Progress, interview with Rianovosti, a Russian news agency, “U.S.-Russian relations: The reset process may not be irreversible,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20110311/162949812.html" rel="nofollow">http://en.rian.ru/valdai_op/20110311/162949812.html</a>)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">I don’t think Vice President Joe Biden’s visit was at all connected to the upcoming presidential elections in the United States. But the fact that he met with both members of the Russian governing tandem in Moscow indicates that the United States is ready to cooperate with either man after the elections, whoever the Russians elect. In my opinion, <u>domestic political processes and election results in Russia and the United States could influence the relationship.</u> <u>If the current presidents are re-elected, the elections’ outcome will not influence it, but internal political tensions during the election period sometimes affect a country’s foreign policy actions</u>… <u>As for the most promising areas of U.S.-Russian relations, bilateral cooperation is possible in many spheres, <strong>from economic development to strategic nuclear weapons. The immediate issues on their agenda include Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization, cooperation on ballistic missile defense, and developing trade and economic ties</strong>.</u> I am not sure that we have entered a phase of bilateral relations where the current positive atmosphere could be said to be irreversible. In my opinion, <strong><u>we have not yet disarmed all the time bombs that still threaten to take our relations back to where they were 2.5 years ago</u></strong>. I think that, unfortunately, should certain circumstances arise, this process could be reversed</span><br />
