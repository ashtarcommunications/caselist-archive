=Affirmative= 

==*READ THIS NOTE*== 

The affirmatives below are the generic "starter" 1AC's that they began the season with - I cannot guarantee that the 1AC's below are the exact ones that will be read in the round for, as we know, novices grow faster over the season and thus some will have the time to add more things. Please feel free to ask the team that is being debated from Niles West if the 1AC they plan on reading is the same as the one that you see here. They may actually have their own wiki, in which case you should go look at that one instead of this one.

Good luck!
