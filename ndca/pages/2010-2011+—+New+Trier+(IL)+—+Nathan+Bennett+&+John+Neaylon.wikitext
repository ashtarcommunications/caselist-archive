China's position on TMD...system could defend all of Taiwan.

Plan solves Chinese perception

Regionally, China has been...China to join in this endeavor.

Absent plan China accelerates modernization
Yoshihara, 10 (Toshi, associate professor in the Strategy and Policy Department at the Naval War College, PhD in international relations, “CHINESE MISSILE STRATEGY AND THE U.S. NAVAL PRESENCE IN JAPAN,” http://www.andrewerickson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Chinese-Missile-Strategy_Yoshihara_Toshi_NWCR_2010-Summer.pdf)
Several intervening factors...reasons to worry about these complications.

That causes miscalc

At the same time...vastly more capable nuclear power.

The impact is nuclear war
Twomey, 09 – Professor at the Naval Postgraduate College (Christopher P., “Chinese-U.S. Strategic Affairs”, Arms Control Association, January/February 2009, http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2009_01-02/china_us_dangerous_dynamism, KONTOPOULOS)
China and the United States are...in an intense crisis.


Contention Three: Taiwan

Plan solves perception of intervention in Taiwan conflict
Zhang, 05 (Hui, Research associate in the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government., December, “Action/Reaction: U.S. Space Weaponization and China”, http://www.armscontrol.org/print/1943, THE)
A Loss of Strategic Nuclear Deterrent Capability...potentially with Taiwan.

It’s only a question of perception—plan breaks down the illusion of an alliance with Taiwan that causes China-Taiwan war
Hughes, 06 (Christopher W., Principal Research Fellow & Acting Co-Director at the Centre for the Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation at the University of Warwick, December, “Ballistic Missile Defence and US-Japan and US-UK Alliances Compared”, http://www.garnet-eu.org/fileadmin/documents/working_papers/1106.pdf)
Instead, the principal security...further momentum for a regional arms race.

BMD forces a Chinese first strike on Taiwan
Chase, 09 (Dr. Michael S., Assistant Professor in the Strategy and Policy Department – Naval War College, et al., “Chinese Theater and Strategic Missile Force Modernization and its Implications for the United States,” Journal of Strategic Studies, Vol. 23, Iss. 1, Feb., http://www.informaworld.com. proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/ smpp/section?content= a908916446&fulltext=713240928
A third and perhaps equally important...in a showdown over Taiwan.

No defense—they’ll break their NFU

Scenario Two: Crisis-driven...be part of Chinese planning.

We control inevitability—peaceful reunification is only possible with the plan
Hurd, 09 (Dale, CBN News Senior Reporter, Chinese Attack on Taiwan: War for U.S.?, March 25, http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2009/March/Chinese-Attack-on-Taiwan-War-for-US-/
Beijing recently authorized...never start in the first place.

The alternative is extinction
Straits Times, 00 (Ching Cheong, Straits times, July 25 2000, l/n)
The high-intensity scenario...we would see the destruction of civilisation.

That’s the most probable impact
Shirk, 08 – Ho Miu Lam Professor of China and Pacific Relations at the University of California-San Diego (Susan, China Fragile Superpower, p. 2, Google Books, KONTOPOULOS)
Taiwan is an issue that...political survival depended on it.

Escalation
Lieber and Press, 07 – *Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame AND Professor of Government at Dartmouth College and Military Consultant for the DOD (*Keir A., Daryl G., “U.S. Nuclear Primacy and the Future of the Chinese Deterrent”, China Security, Winter 2007, p. 72-74, KONTOPOULOS) PDF
A second line of criticism...China want – may in fact be grave.

No impact defense
Shirk, 08 – Ho Miu Lam Professor of China and Pacific Relations at the University of California-San Diego (Susan, China Fragile Superpower, p. 11, Google Books, KONTOPOULOS)
But in a crisis —or...into a military confrontation.


Contention Four: First Strike

Plan is key to balance power between US and China
Chase, 10 (Michael, Assistant Professor in the Strategy and Policy Department at the United States Naval War College, 4/29, “The U.S.-China Strategic Security Relationship and the Nuclear Posture Review Report”, http://www.trumanproject.org/posts/2010/05/us-china-strategic-security-relationship-and-nuclear-posture-review-report, THE)
From Beijing’s perspective...higher alert levels.

Absent plan US takes overly aggressive policies toward China

Recently, some Chinese scholars...help to alleviate some of these concerns.

BMD destroys MAD
Yu and Guangqian, 9 (Rong, Ph. D. candidate at the Institute of International Strategy and Development, School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University. and Peng, editor-in-chief of Strategic Sciences and has long been engaged in research on military strategy and international affairs. “Nuclear No-First-Use Revisited”, http://www.chinasecurity.us/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=225&Itemid=8#rp10, THE)
In addition, the US Ballistic Missile Defense...pre-emptive or even preventative nuclear attack.

And, MAD makes nuclear war impossible
Durr, 02 – Lieutenant Colonel of the U.S. Army (Charles, W., 4/9/02, “NUCLEAR DETERRENCE IN THE THIRD MILLENNIUM”, p. 2-3, KONTOPOULOS) PDF
The fundamentals of nuclear deterrence...rule out the first use of nuclear weapons in such an event.6

The impact is a US first strike
Zhang, 07 – Ph.D. in political science from the University of Texas, Faculty Researcher at the Learning Sciences Lab and an Assistant Professor in the Learning Sciences and Technologies Academic Group at the National Institute of Education (Baohui, “The Modernization of Chinese Nuclear Forces and Its Impact on Sino-U.S. Relations”, Asian Affairs: An American Review, Vol. 34, No. 2, p. 89, KONTOPOULOS) PDF
I disagree with Lieber and Press’s...could invite a U.S. strike on Beijing’s arsenal.”7

It destroys the environment—extinction
Takai, 09 — Retired Colonel and Former Researcher in the military science faculty of the Staff College for Japan’s Ground Self Defense Force (“U.S.-China nuclear strikes would spell doomsday”, October 7, http://www.upiasia.com/Security/2009/10/07/us-china_nuclear_strikes_would_spell_doomsday/7213/)
What would happen if China...Such advice is worth heeding by nuclear hard-liners.


Contention Five: Cruise Missiles

Block-2A deployment specifically targets ballistic missiles
Hicks, 07 (Rear Admiral Alan B., appointed Program Director in November 2005, relieving RADM Kathleen Paige. Previously, RADM Hicks served as Deputy Commander, Warfare Systems Engineering, in the Naval Sea Systems Command and Commander, Naval Surface Warfare Center; commanding officer of the Aegis cruiser USS CAPE ST GEORGE (CG-71); Deputy Director for Combat Systems and Weapons in the Surface Warfare Directorate of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations; and requirements and programmatic action officer in support of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). 11/28, “Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System - Status and Upgrades”, http://www.marshall.org/pdf/materials/573.pdf, THE)
Let’s talk about the Block IIA...aggressive schedule to be flying this missile in the 2014 timeframe, to go into production in 2015.

That causes asymmetric responses from North Korea---particularly cruise missile development
Dutra, 04 – Michael Dutra, Associate, White & Case LLP, 2004, “Strategic Myopia: The United States, Cruise Missiles, and the Missile Technology Control Regime,” Journal of Transnational Law & Policy, Vol. 14, No. 1
Cruise missiles represent a...LACM development becomes easier to obtain.57

It’s unique---rogues are focused on ballistic missiles now---switch to cruise missiles causes nuclear war and CBW attacks
Gormley, 08 – Dennis M. Gormley, senior fellow in the Washington office of the Monterey Institute of International Studies’ James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, September 2008, “The Risks and Challenges of a Cruise Missile Tipping Point,” online: http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_missile_tipping_point.html
Ballistic missiles have dominated...payloads would produce catastrophic consequences.

Bioweapons cause extinction
Steinbruner, 97 – John Steinbruner, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, chair of the committee on international security and arms control of the National Academy of Sciences, December 22, 1997, Foreign Policy
That deceptively simple observation...potential for a global contagion of this sort but not necessarily its outer limit.

North Korean cruise missiles deter U.S. intervention in Asia---they’d be highly effective
Dutra, 04 – Michael Dutra, Associate, White & Case LLP, 2004, “Strategic Myopia: The United States, Cruise Missiles, and the Missile Technology Control Regime,” Journal of Transnational Law & Policy, Vol. 14, No. 1
The threat of cruise missile attack is...loss of American lives and destruction of equipment.132

Adversaries will use cruise missiles early in a conflict, when the U.S. is still deploying---causes withdrawal
Dutra 4 – Michael Dutra, Associate, White & Case LLP, 2004, “Strategic Myopia: The United States, Cruise Missiles, and the Missile Technology Control Regime,” Journal of Transnational Law & Policy, Vol. 14, No. 1
Liddell Hart argues that...albeit less convenient, bases.53

That destroys the foundation of U.S. hegemony
Lind, 07 - Michael Lind, senior fellow at the New America Foundation, May-June 2007, “Beyond American hegemony,” The National Interest, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2751/is_89/ai_n27268888/pg_2/?tag=content;col1
DURING THE Cold War, the...be a "hyperpower."

Hegemony prevents nuclear war---withdrawal causes it

The jostling for status and influence...wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic.

Cruise missile prolif’s worse than ballistic missile prolif:

Checks---plenty of factors mitigate the impact to ballistic missiles---nothing checks cruise missiles
Gormley, 09 – Dennis M. Gormley, senior fellow in the Washington office of the Monterey Institute of International Studies’ James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, December 2009, “Winning on Ballistic Missiles but Losing on Cruise: The Missile Proliferation Battle,” Arms Control Today, online: http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2009_12/Gormley
The Obama decision also...years ahead.

Opacity---makes cruise missiles particularly dangerous
Dutra, 04 – Michael Dutra, Associate, White & Case LLP, 2004, “Strategic Myopia: The United States, Cruise Missiles, and the Missile Technology Control Regime,” Journal of Transnational Law & Policy, Vol. 14, No. 1
The United States will...LACMs particularly troubling for the United States.

Timeframe---ballistic missile prolif is glacially slow---Iran and North Korea are nowhere near a capability after 25 years
Gormley 9 – Dennis M. Gormley, senior fellow in the Washington office of the Monterey Institute of International Studies’ James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, December 2009, “Winning on Ballistic Missiles but Losing on Cruise: The Missile Proliferation Battle,” Arms Control Today, online: http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2009_12/Gormley
What accounts for the fact...money-laundering transactions, designed to work around MTCR controls.

Cruise missile prolif’s faster
Dutra, 04 – Michael Dutra, Associate, White & Case LLP, 2004, “Strategic Myopia: The United States, Cruise Missiles, and the Missile Technology Control Regime,” Journal of Transnational Law & Policy, Vol. 14, No. 1
Unlike ballistic missile development...quickly a state can obtain LACMs.215

== == 
==Japan BMD 1AC---Ohio Valley== 

The United States federal government should end United States military presence in the state of Japan for research, development and deployment of ballistic missile defense.



Contention One: The Status Quo


Cooperation over further missile defense now
O’Rourke 10 (Ronald O'Rourke, Specialist in Naval Affairs at the Congressional Research Service, June 10, 2010, “Navy Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Program: Background and Issues for Congress”, http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL33745.pdf)

The United States regards...from the Sea of Okhotsk.



Contention Two: Miscalculation


Currently deployed missile defense capabilities only threaten short-range and regional missiles, they have no affect on China’s long range ICBMs which is what they care about for deterrence
Rubinstein, 07 – Washington DC consultant on US-Japan Defense Relations [Gregg A., Center for Pacific Asia Studies, “US-Japan Missile Defense Cooperation: Current Status, Future Prospects”, http://www.japanconsidered.com/OccasionalPapers/Rubinstein%20USJA%20BMD%20article%20090507.pdf]

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Democrats retain the House --- Best Models are based on views of the economy and Obama, not voter preference polls</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Mark Blumenthal, 9/6/2010 [Editor and Publisher of Pollser.com, “Political Scientists Forecast Big Losses For Democrats”, http://www.pollster.com/blogs/political_scientists_forecast.php]</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> Democrats currently hold a 256 to 179 seat advantage, so Republicans need to win at least 39 seats to gain majority control. Three of the models, two of which draw on national polls measuring whether voters plan to support the Democrat or Republican candidate in their district, point to Republicans picking up between 49 and 52 seats in the House, more than enough to win majority control. Specifically: Alan Abramowitz of Emory University forecast a Republican gain of 49 seats, based on current polling showing Republican with a roughly five percentage-point lead on the generic House ballot. Joe Bafumi of Dartmouth College presented his forecast of a 50-seat Republican gain, based on a model and paper co-authored with Robert Erikson of Columbia University and Chris Wlezien of Temple University (and summarized last month in the Huffington Post). Their model also rests heavily on national polling on U.S. House vote preferences. James Campbell of SUNY Buffalo predicted a gain of 50 to 52 seats for the Republicans, using a model that combines assessments of the number of "seats in peril" by the Cook Political Report with the recent job approval rating of president Barack Obama. Two more models offered a less pessimistic outlook for the Democrats: Alfred Cuzan forecast a Republican gain of 27 to 30 seats based on a model, developed with University of West Florida colleague Charles Bundrick, that relies mostly on measures of economic growth and inflation rather than voter preference polling. Michael Lewis Beck of the University of Iowa predicted a Republic gain of just 22 seats. He collaborated with Charles Tien of CUNY Hunter College on a more than 30-year-old "referendum" model based on measurements earlier this year. Their model was the only one to exclude measurements of the current seat division between Democrats and Republicans. Why so much variation in the forecasts? Another speaker, Gary Jacobson of the University of California San Diego, pointed out that the number of previous elections typically used by forecasters (typically between 16 and 32) is "not a very big number," while a great many "plausible" predictive measures exist. Moreover, the national polling numbers used by the modelers are often "really, really noisy." Jacobson also noted the differences between the "fundamentalist" models of Cuzan/Bundrick and Lewis-Beck/Tien that assume that views of the economy and the Obama administration drive voting, and the others that use vote preference questions which, as he put it, "add in the information that's already the product of these fundamentals" as well as "the other stuff that's going on" with voter preferences. Lewis-Beck argued that the "the best models are based on theory ... things that we know [or] that we're pretty certain we know," which in this case means the belief that "people vote about the main direction of the economy, and they vote about big macro political issues," especially in midterm elections. At least one of the academics noted the apparent gap between what the fundamentals alone predict and what the polls are picking up. "Republicans are polling a lot better than they should be," Bob Erikson argued, "by [the] fundamentals."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Obama’s focus on the economy is saving the democratic majority</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">E.J. Dionne, 9/9/2010 [Washington Post Writer, “It's Not Over Till It's Over”, [[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/09/09/its_not_over_till_its_over_107077.html]]]</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">WASHINGTON -- President Obama decided this week to raise the stakes in this fall's election by making the choice about something instead of nothing but anger. In the process, he will confront a deeply embedded media narrative that sees a Republican triumph as all but inevitable. Paradoxically, such extravagant expectations may be the GOP's biggest problem -- by raising the bar for what will constitute success, and by discouraging necessary strategic adjustments should our newly combative president begin to alter the political battlefield. Until Obama's Labor Day speech in Milwaukee and his Cleveland-area statement of principles on Wednesday, it was not clear how much heart he had in the fight, or whether he'd ever offer a comprehensive argument for the advantage of his party's approach over the other's. In the absence of a coherent case, Republicans were winning by default on a wave of protest votes. Without this new effort at self-definition, Obama was a blur: a socialist to conservatives, a sellout to some progressives, and a disappointment to younger Americans who wondered what happened to the ebullient, hopeful guy they voted for. That's why the Milwaukee-Cleveland one-two punch mattered. The first speech showed Obama could fight and enjoy himself in the process. The second speech spelled out why he's chosen to do battle. The news headline was Obama's decision to draw the line on George W. Bush's tax cuts. He would continue the most economically stimulative cuts for families earning under $250,000 a year but say no to extending the rest of the tax cuts which, as Obama noted, "would have us borrow $700 billion over the next 10 years to give a tax cut of about $100,000 to folks who are already millionaires." What do Democrats stand for if they are not willing to take on this cause? But even more, Wednesday's speech in Parma, Ohio, saw Obama speaking openly about the philosophical underpinnings of his presidency by way of explaining where he would lead the country. "I've never believed that government has all the answers to our problems ... ," Obama said. "But in the words of the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, I also believe that government should do for the people what they cannot do better for themselves." And then he offered examples of what that meant, highlighting programs Americans actually believe in, as an antidote to empty and abstract anti-government rhetoric. Suddenly, there's a point to this election. Obama is late to this game, but at least he's finally playing it. The New Obama (or, rather, the resurrected Old Obama) will be up against a media story line whose self-sustaining quality was brought home by the treatment of Gallup poll findings over the last two months. The media largely ignored a mid-July survey giving Democrats a six-point lead, then devoted huge blocks of print and airtime to last week's Gallup survey dramatizing conventional wisdom by showing Republicans ahead by a whopping 10 points -- only to have Gallup come out this week with a poll showing Republicans and Democrats tied. All this raises the question of whether the only polls that matter are the ones that reinforce preconceptions. Even Democrats concede a Republican sweep may be in the cards. But there is another possibility: that we are now at the Republican peak, and that Democrats are in a position to claw back enough support to hang on to both houses of Congress. Republican voters simply can't get more enthusiastic without violating the law by casting multiple ballots. Democrats, on the other hand, have a large swath of yet-to-be motivated sympathizers. For Republicans, the costs of Tea Party extremism are beginning to balance the benefits of the movement's energy. Republican pollster David Winston thinks the economy has given his party "an enormous opening," but he cautions against seeing the contest as over and done with. As a technical matter, he argues that likely voter screens applied by pollsters too early exclude a disproportionate number of voters in key Democratic constituencies. And the economic debate Obama tried to reframe this week, Winston said, "is going to have an impact. It's not enough for Obama to be wrong. If Republicans want to get to a majority, they have to lay out where they want to go." Yes, Republicans had better start defining themselves. If they don't, Obama, who labeled them the party of "stagnant growth, eroding competitiveness and a shrinking middle class," is now happy to do it for them. And that's what changed in Milwaukee and Cleveland.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> Thus, while Obama might feel more comfortable concentrating on foreign affairs and is marginally freer to do so, he is compelled to stay focused on job creation and financial reform in the short term to minimise the midterm electoral losses, and in the longer term to maximise his chances for re-election in 2012. He also has other agenda items to protect. One is energy reform, which has both domestic and international elements. The administration's recent decision to allow offshore oil drilling for the first time in decades - to the delight of many Republicans and the dismay of many Democrats - demonstrates how willing he is to placate Republicans to get meaningful restrictions on carbon emissions, and more broadly suggests that despite the health-care victory Obama is still more inclined towards calculated compromise than triumphal imperiousness.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">GOP House majority leads to partial government shutdown – collapses the economy</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Brian Beutler, 9/2/2010 [Talking Points Memo, “The 'Un-American' Results If Republicans Really Force A Government Shutdown”, [[http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/09/un-american----what-will-happen-if-republicans-force-a-government-shutdown.php#more]]]</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> If Republicans win one or both houses of Congress and take their pledge to defund the health care law to its extreme, the logical end point of the ensuing fight with the White House will be a government shutdown. Or at least a partial one. And top conservatives are clamoring for that outcome. "I'm almost giddy thinking about a government shutdown next year," tweeted Erick Erickson on Monday. "I cannot wait!" "There's going to be a government shutdown, just like in '95 and '96 but we're going to win it this time and I'll be fightin' on your side," Dick Morris told attendees at the Americans for Prosperity Foundation Conference last week. What neither man explained was how a shutdown would work, and what the consequences would be -- even if Republicans chose to target health care reform narrowly. "It was a mess frankly, and devastating to the civil service," said Donna Shalala, who served as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services during the last government shutdown, which ran from December 16, 1995 through January 6, 1996. "It seems to me it's un-American." "Almost all employees are sent home," says former Labor Department Secretary Robert Reich, who served alongside Shalala. "Most have no idea when they'll be paid again." According to a 2004 report of the Congressional Research Service, "Government shutdowns have necessitated the furloughing of several hundred thousand federal employees and affect all sectors of the economy." The Department of Labor would likely not be spared in a fight over health care reform. Republicans know they can't repeal the health care law, at least not anytime soon. But they've pledged repeatedly that they'll do all they can to, in the words of House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, "ensure that a trillion dollar take over of our health care in this country does not occur." Their weapon of choice is money. If they retake the House and/or the Senate, they promise to defund "every bit of the regulations process," in Cantor's words. But just as President Obama can veto a bill calling for the health care law to be repealed, he can veto appropriations legislation that starves his signature achievement of the dollars it will need to prosper. The target then would be the annual appropriations bill that funds the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. If Republicans don't offer Obama enough money to run those departments, and he vetoes the legislation, all hell can break loose. "Only a few necessary employees (including the cabinet secretaries) remain to make sure absolutely essential tasks are carried out," Reich adds, "but all inspections, grant programs, enforcement actions, litigation, and business advisory services stop." The first, and most immediate effect of a shutdown is furloughs -- hundreds of thousands of workers sent home without pay. That has ripple effects across the country. Shalala ran down the list of functions that would be stopped. "Social Security checks, Medicare reimbursements...welfare checks to the state, Medicaid checks to the state." "HHS was given a lot of money for implementing the new health care plan, and it would be hard to do without the money," she added. Together, that one appropriation accounts for a huge amount of the federal budget, acording to Shalala. "[we're talking] almost half of the budget of the federal government. That's like close down the government." During the 1995-1996 shutdown, according to CRS, "[n]New patients were not accepted into clinical research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ceased disease surveillance (information about the spread of diseases, such as AIDS and flu, were unavailable); hotline calls to NIH concerning diseases were not answered; and toxic waste clean-up work at 609 sites stopped, resulting in 2,400 "Superfund" workers being sent home." To make matters worse, the economy today is in much worse shape than it was in 15 years ago. The impact of employees out of work, and beneficiaries without checks, will hit the country much harder in the next year than it did under President Clinton. "It would stop all new enrollees into the [Social Security] system," Shalala said.</span>
