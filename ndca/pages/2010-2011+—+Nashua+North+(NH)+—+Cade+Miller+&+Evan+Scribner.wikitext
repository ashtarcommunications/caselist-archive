We've run FemIR, gender, Queer Theory, Cap, H&N, Objectivism, and other K's that challenge conventional mindsets
Imperialism and spanos are both cool
nothing wrong with bataille
Cap good and objectivism were fun last year
Egalitarianism was fun, too
you can expect anything out of us, be ready to debate the K 
we're a K team, but we're not afraid to run straight policy, especially if you do a framework dump in the 1ac or something like that.
I'll disclose more neg stuff upon request

january update:
I'm not big about neg disclosure, but i don't have a problem with posting some stuff. you can expect to see us running one off K most rounds. In no particular order, here are my (evan) top 5 favorite/most common authors used: Heidegger/Spanos, Bataille, Deleuze and Guattari (and hardt and negri), Baudrillard, Schmitt.

Please don't put 5 minutes of pre-emps in your 1AC. it's uncool. If you put us in a tough situation, we may do something ridiculous.
