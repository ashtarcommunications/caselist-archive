==DISABILITIES - NFL Qualifiers== 

**YAY NEW AFFS :D :D :D :D :D**



===Contention one is immobility=== 

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Status quo transportation infrastructure intentionally discriminates against persons with disabilities</span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Langan, 2001 </span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Celeste, Associate Professor of English at the University of California Berkeley, “Mobility Disability”, Public Culture, Vol. 13 No. 3, Fall, Project Muse)</span>

To think about mobility disability is to think about norms of speed and ranges of
AND
than the ADA’s “individuals with wheelchairs”: the mass-transit dependent.





<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The exclusion of the disabled body causes existential anxiety and a drive towards perfection</span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mackey 9 </span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(PJ, MA In Philosophy, concentration on Disability Studies, Memorial University, “Crip Utopia and the Future of Disability”, http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/cdd/article/viewFile/23383/21615)</span>

I refer to Frederic Jameson‟s analyses of the Utopian genre to identify and
AND
venues, which in turn prevent individual validation through social activity and paid work





<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Exclusion of the disabled body is emblematic of a refusal of our ultimate finitude as human beings – the plan is critical to an ethic of vulnerability that recognizes the sovereignty and value of all forms of life</span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">McArdle 10</span>__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Patrick, Head of schools of theology, assistant professor of health care ethics, at Australian Catholic University, PhD in practical theology, masters in Moral Theology and Education, “Disability and Relationality: disrupting complacency entering into vulnerability,” //Australian eJournal of Theology//, December, 2010, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 7pt;">[[http://aejt.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/301045/6.AEJT10.23_McArdle_DisabilityandRelationality_Formatted.pdf]]</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">)</span>
Here we face the question: would not a more relational anthropology of human personhood
AND
they hear in the media and even in school or at university.31


<span style="font-size: 13pt;">We have three impacts –</span>


<span style="font-size: 13pt;">First is Control – absent acknowledgement of our finitude, the logic of control caused by otherization leads to extinction</span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Joronen 11</span>__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(coordinator of the Geography graduate school at the University of Turku, Mikko, “Dwelling in the Sites of Finitude: Resisting the Violence of the Metaphysical Globe”, Antipode Volume 43, Issue 4, pages 1127–1154, September 2011)</span>

Perhaps one of the most striking examples of the need for non-violent resistance
AND
domination of nature, capable of calling the living earth a home.




<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Second is Otherness - placing the perfectly abled as first priority devalues the existence of the Other – the impact is endless nihilism and genocide</span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Introna 9</span>__****<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Professor of Organization, Technology and Ethics at Lancaster University (Lucas, “Ethics and the Speaking of Things,” //Theory, Culture & Society// 2009 vol 26 no 4, 25-46,)</span>

In the ethics of hybrids our ethical relationship with things is determined beforehand by us
AND
of ethics, towards an ethos of letting-be of all beings.





<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Third is uncertainty – in the face of uncontrollable catastrophe and cosmic flux, ethics must enter first in your decision calculus</span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Clark 10</span>__****<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Senior Lecturer in Geography at Open University (Nigel, “Ex-Orbitant Generosity: Gifts of Love in a Cold Cosmos”, Parallax, Vol. 16, No. 1, Pg. 80-95)</span>

In this way, desire or love is becoming, and generosity is generativity -
AND
turning away has a defining quality. If not us, then who?



<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Empiricism and other calculations of risk are constructed and replicate the impact</span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gunder and Hillier 09</span>__**<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 8pt;"> (Michael, Senior planning lecturer in the School of Architecture and Planning @ University of Auckland, and Jean, Professor of Town and Country Planning @ School of Architecture, Planning & Landscape @ Newcastle University, //Planning in Ten Words or Less: A Lacanian Entanglement with Spatial Planning,// Ashgate, July 28, 2009, ISBN 0754674576, Pg. 64-66)</span>

Latour argues that a modern constitution ontologically separates cultural and social values from the non
AND
what resides outside the symbolic. Lacan refers to this as the real.



===<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Plan</span>=== 


<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The United States federal government should substantially increase its investment in universally accessible transportation infrastructure in the United States</span>



===<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Contention two is mobility</span>=== 


<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Disability studies is pushed to the margins of the freak show that is identity politics – however, it is critical to existence – the aff opens a place for a new political approach to disabilities</span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Davis 2 </span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Lennard J., “Bending Over Backwards: Disability, Dismodernism, and Other Difficult Positions”, The End of Identity Politics and the Beginning of Dismoderinism”, google books)</span>

In 1995, in the opening pages of Enforcing Normalcy Lennard Davis noted that identity
AND
consequent request to be reassigned as a military ad viser to Prince Feisal:
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Allenby: I may as well tell you, it’s my considered opinion, and that of my staff, that any time spent on the Bedouin will be time wasted. They’re a nation of sheep stealers!</span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Dryden: They did attack Medina...</span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Allenby: . . . and the Turks made mincemeat of them!</span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Dryden: We don’t know that, sir.</span>
__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Allenby</span>__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">: We know they didn’t take it. A storm in a teacup, Brian! </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">A sideshow! If you want my own opinion, this whole theater of operations is a sideshow. The real war is being fought against the Germans, not the Turks</span>__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and not here, but on the Western front, in the trenches! </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Your “Bedouin army</span>__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">,” or what ever it calls itself, </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">would be a sideshow of a side show!</span>__
__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dryden: Big things have small beginnings, sir.’</span>__
General Allenby’s words are true enough if you’re thinking, as Allenby is, of
AND
long as humans have bodies—and embodied minds to theorize them with.




<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Confronting our understanding of disability must be situated at the forefront of ethical deliberation – utilitarian thought justifies the victimization of the disabled</span>
**__Clapton 2003__** <span style="font-size: 10pt;">[Jayne Clapton. Centre for Work, Leisure and Community Research at Griffith University. October 2003. “Tragedy and catastrophe: contentious discourses of ethics and disability”. Journal of Intellectual Disability Research 47:7. Pages 542-544//fitz.</span>
Within the conjunction of disability as personal tragedy and bioethics as medical ethics, the
AND
birth’ (Ossorio 2000) are also embedded in such a moral views.





<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Transportation infrastructure policy must be in the forefront of our discussion – status quo understanding delegates it to the periphery</span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Koch, 2008</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Tom, Adjunct Professor of Medical Ethics at the University of British Columbia, “Spaced Out in the City: the Wrinkled World of Transit for Those With Limited Mobility”, Disability Studies Quarterly, Vol. 28 No. 2, Spring, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt;">[[http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/94/94]]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">)</span>

Making my way slowly toward the geography building I wondered about the nature of impairments
AND
be not simply a political ideal but a social goal in transit planning.







<span style="font-size: 13pt;">A shift to accessible transportation infrastructure solves for exclusion – a policy shift is key</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Julian </span>**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hine and</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Fiona </span>**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mitchell</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 20</span>**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">01</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - Julian Hine and Fiona Mitchell are in the Transport Research Institute at Napier University (“Better for Everyone?

The data presented in this paper have high- lighted the complexity of peoples’ daily
AND
is apparent and is paramount to the development of barrier-free living.

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Federal action key – devolving authority is an act of dismissing responsibility – this form of politics leads to serial policy failure</span>
**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fine</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> **& Hall 10** </span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Prof of Economics U of London & Director of the Public Services International Research Unit – U of Greenwich (Ben & Contesting Neoliberalism: Public Sector Alternatives for Service Delivery Working Paper for the Milan European Economy Workshops 2010 </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt;">[[http://www.economia.unimi.it/uploads/wp/DEAS-2010_27wp.pdf]]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">)</span>

Other areas of policymaking, as with industrial and regional policy, health, education
AND
obviously in the collaboration between companies, donors and development banks over privatisations.



<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Our obligation is to make the inevitable state ethical – the alternative is the destruction of the other</span>
**Simmons 99**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">William Paul, current Associate Professor of Political Science at ASU, formerly at Bethany College in the Department of History and Political Science, “The Third: Levinas' theoretical move from an-archical ethics to the realm of justice and politics,” Philosophy & Social Criticism November 1, 1999 vol. 25 no. 6</span>

Since ‘it is impossible to escape the State’, 70 Levinas insists that the
AND
to itself, only hastens the contrary of what it wants to secure.









==1AC Greenhill== 

===China=== 
First scenario, Sea Lines of Communication in the South China Sea are threatened now –

Terrorism and disputes close shipping lanes
**Rohr 10** (LtCol Karl C., "Amphibious Forces and sea control in South Asia", Sept 10, 2010, [[http://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/article/chokepoint-http://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/article/chokepoint]])

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Countering the Threats, Seizing Opportunity Because of the complicated political geography and the proliferation of antiaccess weapons … interest we must continue to exercise and develop amphibious operations capabilities necessary to regain or deny access to the Strait of Malacca and other global oil chokepoints.</span>


China expansion- their "String of Pearls" strategy cuts off access
**Eshel 11** (David, "2011 Flashpoints: Asia, ~’String Of Pearls~’ Is Securing China~’s Sea Lanes", http://defense-update.com/analysis/2010/20122010_analysis_string_of_pearls.html)

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">A major player in the Asian scene is the Peoples Republic … to surpass the size of the U.S fleet – the report claims. (Recently a Hong Kong newspaper confirmed the existence of the Chinese carrier program, citing official Chinese sources)</span>

And, seabasing is key to protect sealanes whose closure will devastate the oil and energy economy
Rohr 10 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(LtCol Karl C., "Amphibious Forces and sea control in South Asia", Sept 10, 2010, [[http://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/article/chokepoint-http://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/article/chokepoint]])</span>


<span style="font-size: 8pt;">"Control of the seas means security. </span>Control of the seas means peace<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. …</span> a dangerous combination at all times, creating a heightened security concern.


And, that leads to war, terror, and great power conflict
**Royal, 10 (Jedidiah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the US Dept. of Defense "Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crisis," Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal, and Political Perspectives, 2010 p. 205-224)**

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict<span style="font-size: 7pt;">… and thus weak Presidential popularity, </span>are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span>


Second scenario is sovereignty disputes

South China Sea territorial disputes are at a tipping point now –
**Webb 12** (James, U.S. congressman for Virginia, "The South China Sea~’s Gathering Storm", http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444184704577587483914661256.html)

Since World War II, despite … whether the America of 2012 has the will and the capacity to insist that this approach is the only path toward stability.



And, sovereignty disputes escalate - nationalism and blockading lead to miscalc
**Voigt and Robehmed 11** (Kevin and Natalie, "Explainer: South China Sea - Asia~’s most dangerous waters", http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/27/south.china.sea.conflict/index.html?iref=allsearch)

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Who~’s the bad guy here? General Liang~’s charm offensive in Singapore earlier this month — … "We just came out of probably the most peaceful 25 years Asia has ever seen," Dupont added. "</span>We~’re at a tipping point<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> here at the moment and the next 12 or 18 months could be very important."</span>


And, Chinese expansion leads to loss of US power projection and makes a regional war inevitable
**Bosworth 11**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Richard, Lieutenant Commander USN, Naval War College, "Effects of China~’s Sovereignty Claims in the South China Sea", Paper advisor: Professor Don Chrisholm, http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a545911.pdf)</span>

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">"</span>When considering the military-modernization programs of countries like China<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span>we should be concerned<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> … aggressive actions and to reassure our allies and partners of our commitment to the region or risk the loss of military access to areas vital to its security. </span>



And, conflict escalates – the South China Sea is Asia~’s most dangerous flashpoint
**Adams 10** <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Jonathan, "South China Sea: The coming war?" [[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/china/100625/south-china-sea-paracel-spratly-islands-military-http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/china/100625/south-china-sea-paracel-spratly-islands-military]])</span>

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">TAIPEI, Taiwan — It~’s a 3.5 million-square kilometer stretch of ocean, speckled with some 200 coral </span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">atolls, …</span> in the South China Sea<span style="font-size: 7pt;">," wrote the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies~’ Richardson. </span>




And, extinction
Cirinicone 2K<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Joseph, director of the Non-Proliferation Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Foreign Policy, "The Asian Nuclear Reaction Chain," March)</span>

The blocks would fall quickest<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and </span>hardest in Asia, where proliferation pressures are already building<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> …</span>, the first combat use of a nuclear weapon<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> since 1945.</span>




===Hegemony=== 



Three internal links, first is forward basing -

Land ports are open to anti-access and asymmetric attacks - ONLY seabasing solves
**Work 6**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (2006, Robert, vice president for strategic studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Analysis (when written), adjunct professor at George Washington University, teaching defense analysis and roles and missions of the armed forces (when written), current US Under Secretary of the Navy, "Thinking About Seabasing: All Ahead, Slow," [[http://www.csbaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2006.03.01-Seabasing.pdf-http://www.csbaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2006.03.01-Seabasing.pdf]] /KG</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">If anything, the need to remember and relearn this lesson would be even more evident and pressing given the maturation of the Guided Weapons Warfare Regime. … </span>the conditions of the new Joint Expeditionary Era have made updated seabasing concepts an attractive, even irresistible<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, option for joint and naval planners.</span>



Second, Seabasing cuts response times and creates strategic dispersal
Barnard 4 (Richard, Editor in Chief, Navy League of the United States, cites Vice Admiral Charles W. Moore Jr, "Sea Basing Concept Promises a Revolution in Power Projection", [[http://www.navyleague.org/sea_power/jun_04_10.php-http://www.navyleague.org/sea_power/jun_04_10.php]], )

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Sea Basing Concept Promises a Revolution in Power Projection Ten days to the next world hot spot. … developing elements of the sea basing scheme. Included are ConOps groups on logistics, the Maritime Prepositioning Force ship of the Future (MPF(F)), and medical operations.</span>




Third is nuclear deterrence- naval strength key to force credibility
Vego, 8 — professor of operations at the Naval War College, former commanding officer in the former Yugoslav Navy and former West German merchant marine (Milan N., "On Naval Power", Joint Forces Quarterly, July 2008, http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/jfq-50/JFQ-50.pdf)
Blue water navies play a critical role in providing support to national … the Russian Federation, Britain, France, and the People~’s Republic of China.



AND, Collapse of primacy leads to extinction – no other country is ready to takeover
**Brzezinski 12** (Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security advisor under U.S. President Jimmy Carter, January/February 2012, "After America", Foreign Policy, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/01/03/after_america?page=full)

Not so long ago, a high-ranking Chinese official, who obviously had concluded that America~’s decline and China~’s rise … it is imperative that the United States pursue a new, timely strategic vision for its foreign policy — or start bracing itself for a dangerous slide into global turmoil.



AND, primacy prevents conflict – it~’s better than multipolarity- statistics and empirics prove
Drezner 5 ~~[Daniel Drezner, professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law, May 25, 2005, "Gregg Easterbrook, war, and the dangers of extrapolation", [[http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/002087.html-http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/002087.html]]~~]

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Daily explosions in Iraq, massacres in Sudan, the Koreas … to fight a war with the U.S., and if any of these countries waged a war with each other, the prospect of U.S. intervention would be equally daunting. </span>

== == 

===PLAN TEXT=== 

**Thus the plan: the United States Federal Government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment to support a joint naval seabasing strategy – we’ll clarify**


===Solvency=== 



Seabasing solves crisis escalation- it enables flexibility, mobility and force integration
**Perry 11**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> IMPORTANCE OF SEABASING TO LAND POWER GENERATION BY COMMANDER MICHAEL F. PERRY United States Navy [[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA508337-http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA508337]] /KG</span>

In 1954, Samuel P. Huntington reconsidered the classic strategies of naval warfare and urged the U.S. Navy to focus upon sea based support of land power generation … and timely threats to potential adversaries and offers of assistance to allies located throughout the world.





AND, we solve your impact turns – the plan is key to cooperation
Cronin %26 Kaplan 12<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Patrick M., and Robert D., "Cooperation from Strength: U.S. Strategy and the South China Sea", http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_CooperationFromStrength_Cronin_1.pdf) (SLOC = Sea line of Communication) </span>

Although it may seem oxymoronic, cooperation from a position of strength is a way to foster … change its behavior in any fundamental way. But it will take persistent, long-term effort.



AND, US engagement is inevitable- it~’s just a matter of effectiveness
Shalmon and Horowitz 9<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Dan, Graduate Student in the PhD Program in Political Science - International Relations at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Mike, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania- Philadelphia, Orbis, Spring)</span>

It is important to recognize at the outset <span style="font-size: 7pt;">two </span>key …<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> rational choice for actors facing a strong state~’s power projection, irregular/asymmetric threats are inevitable given America~’s role in the global order.24 </span>

PLAN TEXT
**Plan: the United States Federal Government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment to support a joint seabasing strategy – we’ll clarify**


===South Atlantic=== 

Advantage one is the South Atlantic - two scenarios
First is terrorism-

**Seabasing is critical to address constantly evolving threats in the South Atlantic**

Sandoz 11 (Institutionalizing an ‘Irregular Warfare’ Focus in the Navy: Imperatives for Confronting Irregular Challenges John Sandoz Navy addresses and responds to underlying causes of instability.8 May 2011 smallwarsjournal.com/sites/default/files/842-sandoz.pdf /KG)

Irregular threats are becoming the new normal.... Navy multi-mission ships and aviation capabilities extended the reach and effectiveness of operations to counter irregular threats.



**The Panama Canal is vulnerable to irregular threats**

Shie 04 Ports in a Storm? By Tamara Renee Shie Visiting Fellow Issues & Insights Vol. 4 –– No. 4 No. 4 Pacific Forum CSIS Honolulu, Hawaiii
The very nature of the international shipping trade has made it far more vulnerable to potential abuses and yet also far more difficult to protect. ... That leaves vital shipping channels vulnerable

**Terrorist attacks on the canal collapse the global economy**
Watts 10 S e c u r i ty o f th e P a n a m a C a n a l O n e de c a d e a f te r U . S . de p a r tu r e Kimberly Dannels-Ruff Michelle A. Watts /KG

The U.S. still has vital national security and economic interests in Panama. ... the Canal is “critical to U.S. defense planning.”26

**That results in great power conflict**

Royal 10 — Jedidiah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, M.Phil. Candidate at the University of New South Wales, 2010 (“Economic Integration, Economic Signalling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, Edited by Ben Goldsmith and Jurgen Brauer, Published by Emerald Group Publishing, ISBN 0857240048, p. 213-215)

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict..... As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.


Second scenario is the Caribbean-

**Narcoterrorists are proliferating in the region now – they’ll employ biological and chemical weapons – that collapses democracy and nation-states**
Godlewski 12 (R.J., counterterrorism specialist, focusing on Central America, “The (not so) Secret Militarization of Narco-Insurgencies in Latin America”, http://righttruth.typepad.com/right_truth/2012/10/the-not-so-secret-militarization-of-narco-insurgencies-in-latin-america.html)//AMV//
Drug cartels and associated transnational criminal organizations share a common element amongst their trade –... national militaries and law enforcement agencies are often downsizing and shedding units under the duress of reduced tax revenues and soaring public debts.

**A collapse of nation-states makes conflict inevitable**
Lloyd 11, Sharon A. and Sreedhar, Susanne, "Hobbes's Moral and Political Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/hobbes-moral/>.

Hobbes's near descendant, ... the state of nature would become a “state of war”, even worse, a war of “all against all”.

**Democracy solves multiple scenarios for extinction**
Diamond ‘95 (Larry Diamond, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, December 1995, Promoting Democracy in the 1990s, http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm)
OTHER THREATS This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security and well-being in the coming years and decades.... democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.


**Bioterrorism causes extinction**
Ochs 02 BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS MUST BE ABOLISHED IMMEDIATELY By Richard Ochs http://www.freefromterror.net/other_articles/abolish.html /KG

Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth.... Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE.

**AND- seabasing solves- it allows flexibility and mobility that stabilizes affected countries**
Hack 7 30 MAR 2007 SEABASING: A JOINT PROJECTION PLATFORM by Colonel Armon A. Cioppa United States Army Colonel Dallas Hack Project Advise http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a469193.pdf /KG
The importance of littorals in relation to globalization and world stability also gains support in Thomas Barnett’s book, “The Pentagon’s New Map.” ... Seabasing balances the capabilities for strategic responsiveness with battle space dominance— deployability, lethality, survivability, agility, versatility, and sustainability.



===Hegemony=== 

Advantage two is hegemony

Two internal links –
**First- forward bases are open to anti-access and asymmetric attacks - ONLY seabasing solves**

Work 6 (2006, Robert, vice president for strategic studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Analysis (when written), adjunct professor at George Washington University, teaching defense analysis and roles and missions of the armed forces (when written), current US Under Secretary of the Navy, “Thinking About Seabasing: All Ahead, Slow,” http://www.csbaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2006.03.01-Seabasing.pdf /KG
If anything, the need to remember and relearn this lesson would be even more evident and pressing given the maturation of the Guided Weapons Warfare Regime. ... the conditions of the new Joint Expeditionary Era have made updated seabasing concepts an attractive, even irresistible, option for joint and naval planners.
The second internal link is China

**The South China Sea is a battleground for power transition – only naval presence solves**
Cronin & Kaplan 12 (Patrick M., and Robert D., “Cooperation from Strength: U.S. Strategy and the South China Sea”, http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_CooperationFromStrength_Cronin_1.pdf)

The United States must rebalance away from the conflict-ridden Middle East and toward the Asia- Pacific region, the center of the world economy. ... America’s position in the South China Sea region is less firmly moored by history, both in terms of force posture and with respect to clear, common objectives.

**Absent a shift to seabasing in the Asia-Pacific region, United States hegemony will collapse**
Corleto 11 (Joseph R., Lieutenant Colonel, “Future Joint Seabasing in the Asia-Pacific Region”, United States Army War College, http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a553114.pdf

A peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific Region is vital to the security, stability and economic prosperity of the United States, its allies, and partners. ...

In 1954, Samuel P. Huntington reconsidered the classic strategies of naval warfare and urged the U.S. Navy to focus upon sea based support of land power generation ...

AND
new nexus of conflict and begin to send foreign policy back to sea.




===Plan=== 
Plan: the United States federal government should substantially increase its investment for a joint seabasing strategy, we’ll clarify.


===China=== 


Advantage 1 is China. Three scenarios -

First is sea lanes of communication –




China is annexing chokepoints, Gwadar proves
**Haider 12**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Syed Fazl-e-Haider, "A great game begins as China takes control of Gwadar port", http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/a-great-game-begins-as-china-takes-control-of-gwadar-port~~%23ixzz2B4pAH4ch) </span>

A major player in the Asian scene is the Peoples Republic of China. This
AND

And, seabasing is key to protect sealanes; closure devastates the trade and energy economies

"Control of the seas means security. Control of the seas means peace
AND
for a dangerous combination at all times, creating a heightened security concern.


**And, that leads war, great power conflict, and terror**

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force.


Second scenario is sovereignty disputes



Sovereignty claims at a tipping point now
Glaser 12<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Bonnie, senior fellow with the CSIS Freeman Chair in China Studies, where she works on issues related to Chinese foreign and security policy, "Trouble in the South China Sea", [[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/17/trouble_in_the_south_china_sea?page0,1-http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/17/trouble_in_the_south_china_sea?page0,1]] – 9/17/2012)</span>

The prospects for avoiding intense military competition and war may be good, but growth
AND
military efforts and a general poisoning of U.S.-Chinese relations.




Third is power projection –


The South China Sea is a battleground for transition – only naval presence solves – absence causes a collapse
**Cronin %26 Kaplan 12**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Patrick M., and Robert D., "Cooperation from Strength: U.S. Strategy and the South China Sea", http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_CooperationFromStrength_Cronin_1.pdf)</span>

Daily explosions in Iraq, massacres in Sudan, the Koreas staring at each other
AND
, the prospect of U.S. intervention would be equally daunting.





===Syria=== 



Advantage two is Syria

Two internal links –


First is regional instability


Absent intervention, instability exacerbates the conflict and leaves chemical weapons open for theft
**Landay 11/1** <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Jonathan S., McClatchy newspapers reporter, "No matter who wins Tuesday~’s election, U.S. likely to become entangled in Syria~’s war", http://www.kansascity.com/2012/11/01/3896878/no-matter-who-wins-tuesdays-election.html~~%23storylinkcpy)</span>

Second is Regime change

Meanwhile, the existence of an arsenal of mass destruction in such an unstable region
AND
the deepening Middle East conflict could trigger a world conflagration." (44)



United States presence is key – but it requires a shift in basing strategy
**Muasher 10/17**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Marwan, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,served as foreign minister and deputy prime minister of Jordan, "Reviving U.S. Influence in the Middle East", http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/opinion/marwan-muasher-reviving-us-influence-in-the-middle-east.html?_r0)</span>

THERE was a time when American power was viewed as decisive in the Middle East

The importance of littorals in relation to globalization and world stability also gains support in

Although it may seem oxymoronic, cooperation from a position of strength is a way
