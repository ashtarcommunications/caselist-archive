===Hegemony=== 

**Weaponization by other countries is inevitable- means the only option is for the US to weaponize space- that’s key to heg- the U.S needs to get there first to prevent an arms race**
**Dolman 10** (Everett, PhD and Professor of Comparative Military Studies @ US Air Force School of Advanced Air and Space Studies and Recipient of Central Intelligence’s Outstanding Intelligence Analyst Award, “The Case for Weapons in Space: A Geopolitical Assessment,” September, [[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1532576]],)

This is the … space is remote.

**Current vulnerabilities in US space assets are the Achilles heel of deterrence – multiple adversaries with different military doctrines invite attack**
**Rendleman, 10** - Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)

The United States … on arms control.

**Chinese doctrine, spending, and actions all portend an attack on US space assets - it will likely escalate**
**Wortzel, 8** - Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY

The PLA is … any future conflict.

**We’ll isolate a couple of internal links to heg:**

**a) Weaponization’s key to protect space assets that are vital to terrestrial military dominance**
**Dolman 5** (Everett, PhD and Professor of Comparative Military Studies @ US Air Force School of Advanced Air and Space Studies and Recipient of Central Intelligence’s Outstanding Intelligence Analyst Award, “ US Military Transformation and Weapons in Space,” September 14th, <span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.e-parl.net/pages/space_hearing_images/ConfPaper%20Dolman%20US%20Military%20Transform%20&%20Space.pdf]]</span>, EMM)

There is little … future American empire.

**Spacepower is critical to global stability and conflict resolution - provides transparency to reduce miscalculation, strengthens dissuasion power, and deters conflict**
**Smith 11** (M.V., Colonel, PhD in Politics and IR @ University of Reading, Citing Colin Gray, “Chapter 17: Security and Spacepower, Part of “Toward a Theory of Spacepower,” Edited by Charles Lutes and Peter Hays, National Defense University Press,<span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf]]</span>, EMM)

Spacepower provides different … deterrence more effective.

**That’s Extinction**
**Cheong 2k** (Ching, Senior Writer at the Strait Times, “No one gains in a war over Taiwan,” June 25th, Lexis)

THE high-intensity …destruction of civilization.

**Independently, perceived vulnerability to a Space Pearl Harbor will cause the US to preemptively strike China - causes escalation**
**Tellis 7** (Ashley, Senior Associate @ Carnegie, Survival, Autumn, “China’s Military Space Strategy”, ingenta)
