**Welcome! Our last tournament was Golden Desert, so I'm left with a lot of CPs and no more tournaments. If you see anything on our wiki that you'd like the file (probably prepped too) just send me an email at calliechappell44@gmail.com, and I'll send it your way. I did a ton of work for the season, and I don't want all of it to go to waste!** 
**Good luck!**

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Trains are often a preferred mode of travel, especially for distances between 100 and 500 miles. </span>A 2009 __[[#|survey]]__ found that if __[[#|fare]]__ and travel time were equal, 54 percent of Americans would prefer to travel to cities<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in their region </span>by high-speed rail<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, with only 33 percent preferring car travel and 13 preferring air travel. </span>Of Americans who had actually ridden high-speed rail, an overwhelming 82 percent preferred it<span style="font-size: 8pt;">to air travel</span>.29

**<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Second is models</span>**

While it is true most Americans don’t<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> (presently) </span>use railroads<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>they (presently) use cars, what’s the point?<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Is it to suggest that just because that is the way things are today they can’t or won’t change in the future? </span>What about when gasoline is pushing $8.00 a gallon<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> like it is in most other parts of the world? Should people be permanently locked in their cars or on airplanes with no other alternative means of travel for distances of 100 to 600 miles</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>except to wait in long lines and endure both high cost and insulting scrutiny as they attempt to board an airplane?<span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span> And that “small segment of the population?” According to the Census Bureau 2010 Census,more than 70 percent of the nation’s population lives in or reasonably close to urban centers<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>Under the administration’s plan to develop and improve intercity passenger rail service, this segment of the population could avail themselves of this revitalized transportation option over the next decade and beyond.
