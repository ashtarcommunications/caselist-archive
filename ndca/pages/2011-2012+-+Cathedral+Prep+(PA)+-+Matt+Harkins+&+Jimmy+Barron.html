Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) was not alone when he recently compared American behavior at Guantanamo Bay to that of &quot;Nazis, Soviets in their gulags, or some mad regime - Pol Pot or others - that had no concern for human beings.&quot; Tarring Bush and co. with Hitlerian imagery has become a debased parlor game. Politicians and other public figures toss about these charged references, expecting to create a buzz and assuming that their audience is as uninformed as they are. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) cited the Holocaust to blast American policy in Iraq: &quot;This is just as bad as the 6 million Jews being killed.&quot; In his upside-down world, the mass murderer is the moral equivalent of those who stop him. Before Rangel, Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) evoked Nazi Germany to warn about the Bush administration. An official of the Red Cross lectured that American guards at Guantanamo were &quot;no better than and no different than the Nazi concentration camp guards.&quot; Left unsaid was the logical sick corollary: If the perpetrators of the Holocaust were really no worse than American guards at Guantanamo, then, as is the case at Guantanamo where not one death has been reported, did no one really perish at Belsen or Treblinka, either? And these people aren't the only ones to stoop to play this game. There's also been NAACP Chairman Julian Bond (&quot;The American flag and the Confederate swastika&quot;), former Ohio Sen. John Glenn (&quot;It's the old Hitler business&quot;), Garrison Keillor (&quot;Brownshirts in pinstripes&quot;), Linda Ronstadt (&quot;A new bunch of Hitlers&quot;) and Al Gore (&quot;Digital brownshirts&quot;). Why suddenly is Hitler popping up everywhere when the Nazis have absolutely no relation with a democratic United States or a humane military? Time Magazine recently reported that when the suspected 20th Sept. 11 hijacker, Mohammed al-Qahtani, was in distress, he was given a CAT scan and put on a heart monitor, while a radiologist was flown to Cuba for consultation. In contrast, is Sen. Durbin aware that the Nazis laid railroad tracks to the very gates of Auschwitz to facilitate its engine of mass death, an industry that would take over 6 million people? Or can he grasp the idea of 25 million perishing in the gulag - the population of Durbin's home state of Illinois being exterminated twice over? Note the escalating frustration behind these outbursts. Although an occasional conservative like Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) has stooped to Hitlerian slander, most of the offenders, such as Michael Moore (comparing the Patriot Act to &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;) or George Soros (saying Bush reminded him of &quot;the Germans&quot;), are on the left, furious over their inability to affect the course of events. Since Sept. 11, we have had midterm and national elections, both referenda on the so-called war against terror. Those on the left have lost the majority of state legislatures, governorships, the House, the Senate, the presidency and perhaps the Supreme Court. If normal debate somehow didn't rile up the somnolent American people, why not try conjuring up the ghosts of Hitler or Stalin? There is also an asymmetry in these slurs. Few mention that there really are monsters and mass killers living among us - the North Koreans who have starved 1 million of their own, Saddam's reign of terror that may have killed as many, and, of course, the Islamicist murderers who behead, blow up and torture. &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; still is selling well in some Arab capitals, not in Washington or New York. So cowards such as officials of the Red Cross and Amnesty International, and, yes, American politicians, prefer to showboat the purported misdemeanors of those who are civilized and will listen to them, rather than to condemn the horrendous felonies of those who are barbaric and will not pay them heed. As a result, the bar is lowering. In today's climate, Alfred Knopf has already published a novel about killing the president. Charlie Brooker writing in the Guardian in London prayed for another Lee Harvey Oswald to take out George W. Bush. Comedians, New York plays and art exhibits also bandy about assassination. Each time a public official evokes Hitler to demonize the president, the American effort in Iraq or its conservative supporters, cheap rhetorical fantasy becomes only that much closer to a nightmarish reality where the unstable, here and abroad, act on the belief that America really is Hitler's Germany. We will all soon reap what the ignorant are now sowing. ©2005 Victor Davis Hanson<br />

 A. Interpretation - Exploration means to expand staffed missions into space<br />
Logsdon, 9 – professor of political science at George Washington, former director of the Space Policy Institute (John, “Fifty Years of Human Spaceflight Why Is There Still a Controversy?,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1973:http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1973 -->)<br />
<br />
Exploration as a Compelling Rationale Many believe that the only sustainable rationale for a government-funded program of human spaceflight is to take the lead in exploring the solar system beyond low Earth orbit.20 The MIT white paper provides an insightful definition of exploration: Exploration is a human activity, undertaken by certain cultures at certain times for particular reasons. It has components of national interest, scientific research, and technical innovation, but is defined by none of them. We define exploration as an expansion of the realm of human experience, bringing people into new places, situations, and environments, expanding and redefining what it means to be human. What is the role of Earth in human life? Is human life fundamentally tied to the earth, or could it survive without the planet? Human presence, and its attendant risk, turns a spaceflight into a story that is compelling to large numbers of people. Exploration also has a moral dimension because it is in effect a cultural conversation on the nature and meaning of human life. Exploration by this definition can only be accomplished by direct human presence and may be deemed worthy of the risk of human life.21 In the wake of the 2003 Columbia accident that took the lives of seven astronauts and the report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board that criticized the absence of a compelling mission for human spaceflight as “a failure of national leadership,”22 the United States, in January 2004, adopted a new policy to guide its human spaceflight activities. The policy directed NASA to “implement a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system and beyond” and to “extend human presence across the solar system, starting with a human return to the Moon by the year 2020, in preparation for human exploration of Mars and other destinations.”23 This policy seems totally consistent with the definition of exploration provided in the MIT white paper. The issue is whether such a policy and its implementation, focusing on human exploration beyond Earth orbit, can provide an adequate and sustainable justification for a continuing program of government-sponsored spaceflight that will make contributions that will outweigh the costs and risks involved to the “primary objectives” of national pride and prestige, and also to some of the several “secondary objectives.”<br />

So does development<br />
Livingston 07 – former adjunct professor in the Graduate School of Business at Golden Gate University his doctoral dissertation was titled “Outer Space Commerce: Its History and Prospects” citing Eric Westling co-author of “The Space Elevator” and numerous papers on space tech and development [quals in card] (9/10/07, “This Week On The Space Show: Eric Westling”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1974:http://www.thespaceshow.com/guest.asp?q=298 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespaceshow.com/guest.asp?q=298" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespaceshow.com/guest.asp?q=298</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1974 -->)<br />
<br />
Eric Westling is a science writer, pundit on science, technology, and economics. He is the co-author of “The Space Elevator” with Dr. Brad Edwards . In addition, Mr. Westling is retired and is a former Army officer and helicopter pilot, civilian Airline Transport Pilot (ATP), former consultant to many small companies regarding engineering, computer, and business troubleshooting. His most recent papers are on Solar Power Satellites, Economics of the Space Elevator, Energy and time lag in the 21st century , and Eric’s axioms (a list of principles of science, technology and economics). Mr. Westling stats that “Space Development is the only long term answer to the, just starting, energy shortage; which will otherwise continue until we have an economic collapse.” He believes that no-one is doing space development . Instead, we have space technology, not development. NASA has no TRL 10 – therefore no plans to develop space . He defines space development as the rapid expansion of manned [staffed] commercial projects in space.<br />

B. Violation – the affirmative doesn’t increase human missions in space<br />

C. Voting issue –<br />
<br />
1. Limits – they allow all robots, satellites, probes, and rovers. There are tons of subsets of these categories that the hardest working 2N couldn’t keep up with.<br />
<br />
2. Negative Ground – random space telescopes are impossible to get disad links to- staffed missions have major controversy ground that both sides can take advantage of.<br />
<br />
3. Precision- our evidence is from the most predictable source and has an intent to define. Any other source makes their interpretation arbitrary and unpredictable.<br />
<br />
3. Competing interpretations is the best lens for evaluating debate- a. Judge intervention- I think they’re not reasonable but I’m not sure if you do. B. Doesn’t cause a race to the bottom- if we want to win we’ll find the best definition, not the most limiting one.<br />

 A. Interpretation: the plan text must have proper punctuation.<br />

B. Violation: there’s no punctuation mark at the end of the plan text.<br />

C. Standards<br />
1. Not resolved- The plan could be a question or a statement. We’ll never know because they didn’t tell us. This makes them untopical because “Resolved” means “fixity of purpose”—Webster’s dictionary in 2001.<br />
<br />
2. Proper grammar usage is key to communication<br />
Allen, Editor and Director of The Chambers Dictionary 1993 (Robert, Does Grammar Matter?)<br />
Grammar matters, then, because it is the accepted way of using language, whatever one’s exact interpretation of the term. Incorrect grammar hampers communication, which is the whole purpose of language. The grammar of standard English matters because it is a codification of the way using English that most people will find acceptable.<br />
<br />
3. Policymaking training- if the goal of debate is to mimic policymaking then their presentation of a bill in Congress would be laughed at.<br />
<br />
4. Limits- we only allow for plan texts that actually meet the grammatical standards that would be set by the English language and actual congressional legislation. Letting their plan text in allows for tons of artificial languages to be used in plan texts that we can’t be prepared to learn.<br />
<br />
D. This also means they can’t solve because the people who would implement the plan wouldn’t know what to do with an open ended sentence.<br />

 We're methodologically competitive -- our alternative is not some arbitrarily utopian course of action but rather a conceptual apparatus that encounters a different world than the plan. The politics of the affirmative are one of forced movement reacting against the chaotic universe they claim to affirm by including the plan as a false model that insists upon the success of order, repeating the catastrophe in the same method that it is caused. If the perm has a net-benefit then it demonstrably relies on the desirability of a conceptually ordered world that should be rejected. The politics of the alternative is natural movement, which takes joy in the dynamics of historical material and is necessary to understand the conditions of possibility for all political becoming<br />

 The politics of space, specifically the discourse centered on exploration, development, and colonization reproduce heteronormative hierarchies which ensure such hierarchies spread to space.<br />
Griffin 9 (Penny, Senior Lecturer - Convenor, MA International Relations, ‘The Spaces Between Us: The Gendered Politics of Outer Space’, in Bormann, N. and Sheehan, M. (eds), Securing Outer Space. London and New York: Routledge, pp.59-60)<br />
This chapter is about sex, but not the sex that people already have clarity about. 'Outer space' as a human, political domain is organized around sex, but a 'sex' that is tacitly located, and rarely spoken, in official discourse. The poli¬ tics of outer space exploration, militarization and commercialization as they are conceived of and practiced in the US, embody a distinction between public and private (and appropriate behaviours, meanings and identities therein) highly dependent upon heteronormative hierarchies of property and propriety.1 The central aim of this chapter is to show how US outer space discourse, an imperial discourse of technological, military and commercial superiority, configutes and prescribes success and successful behaviour in the politics of outer space in particularly gendered forms. US space discourse is, I argue, predicated on a heteronormative discourse of conquest that reproduces the dominance of heterosexual masculinity(ies), and which hierarchically orders the construction of other (subordinate) gender identities. Reading the politics of outer space as heteronormative suggests that the discourses through which space exists consist of institutions, structures of understanding, practical orientations and regulatory practices organized and privileged around heterosexuality. As a particularly dominant discursive arrangement of outer space politics, US space discourse (re)produces meaning through gendered assumptions of exploration, colonization, economic endeavour and military conquest that are deeply gendered whilst presented as universal and neutral. US space discourse, which dominates the contemporary global politics of outer space, is thus formed from and upon institutions, structures of understanding, and practical orientations that privilege and normalize heterosexualiry as universal. As such, the hegemonic discursive rationalizations of space exploration and conquest ,re)produce both heterosexuality as 'unmarked' (that is, thoroughly normal¬ ized) and the heterosexual imperatives that constitute suitable space-able people, practices and behaviours. As the introduction to this volume highlights, the exploration and utilization of outer space can thus far be held up as a mirror of, rather than a challenge to, existent, terrestrially-bound, political patterns, behaviours and impulses. The new possibilities for human progress that the application and development of space technologies dares us to make are grounded only in the strategy¬ obsessed (be it commercially, militarily or otherwise) realities of contemporary global politics. Outer space is a conceptual, political and material space, a place for collisions and collusions (literally and metaphorically) between objects, ideas, identities and discourses. Outer space, like international relations, is a global space always socially and locally embedded. There is nothing 'out there' about outer space. It exists because of us, not in spite of us, and it is this that means that it only makes sense in social terms, that is, in relation to our own constructions of identity and social location. In this chapter, outer space is the problematic to which I apply a gender analysis; an arena wherein past, current and future policy-making is embedded in relation to certain performances of power and reconfigurations of identity that are always, and not incidentally, gendered. Effective and appropriate behaviour in the politics of ourer space is configured and prescribed in particularly gendered forms, with heteronormative gender regulations endowing outer space's hierarchies of technologically superior, conquesting performance with theif everyday power. It is through gender that US techno-strategic and astro-political discourse has been able to (re)produce outer space as a heterosexualized, masculinized realm.<br />

Heteronormativity results in omnicide. The combination of the universal suspicion of Queerness and the genocidal impulse to eradicate it motivates a larger apocalyptic movement to rescue hetero-culture with extinction.<br />
Sedgwick 8 (Eve, Professor of English at Duke University, Epistemology of the Closet, second revised edition, California at Berkeley Press, p. 127-130)<br />
From at least the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah, scenarios of same-sex desire would seem to have had a privileged, though by no means an exclusive, relation in Western culture to scenarios of both genocide and omnicide. That sodomy, the name by which homosexual acts are known even today to the law of half of the United States and to the Supreme Court of all of them, should already be inscribed with the name of a site of mass extermination is the appropriate trace of a double history. In the first place there is a history of the mortal suppression, legal or subjudicial, of gay acts and gay people, through burning, hounding, physical and chemical castration, concentration camps, bashing—the array of sanctioned fatalities that Louis Crompton records under the name of gay genocide, and whose supposed eugenic motive becomes only the more colorable with the emergence of a distinct, naturalized minority identity in the nineteenth century. In the second place, though, there is the inveterate topos of associating gay acts or persons with fatalities vastly broader than their own extent: if it is ambiguous whether every denizen of the obliterated Sodom was a sodomite, clearly not every Roman of the late Empire can have been so, despite Gibbon's connecting the eclipse of the whole people to the habits of a few. Following both Gibbon and the Bible, moreover, with an impetus borrowed from Darwin, one of the few areas of agreement among modern Marxist, Nazi, and liberal capitalist ideologies is that there is a peculiarly close, though never precisely defined, affinity between same-sex desire and some historical condition of moribundity, called &quot;decadence,&quot; to which not individuals or minorities but whole civilizations are subject. Bloodletting on a scale more massive by orders of magnitude than any gay minority presence in the culture is the &quot;cure,&quot; if cure there be, to the mortal illness of decadence. If a fantasy trajectory, utopian in its own terms, toward gay genocide has been endemic in Western culture from its origins, then, it may also have been true that the trajectory toward gay genocide was never clearly distinguishable from a broader, apocalyptic trajectory toward something approaching omnicide. The deadlock of the past century between minoritizing and universalizing understandings of homo/heterosexual definition can only have deepened this fatal bond in the heterosexist imaginaire. In our culture as in Billy Budd, the phobic narrative trajectory toward imagining a time after the homosexual is finally inseparable from that toward imagining a time after the human; in the wake of the homosexual, the wake incessantly produced since first there were homosexuals, every human relation is pulled into its shining representational furrow. Fragments of visions of a time after the homosexual are, of course, currently in dizzying circulation in our culture. One of the many dangerous ways that AIDS discourse seems to ratify and amplify preinscribed homophobic mythologies is in its pseudo-evolutionary presentation of male homosexuality as a stage doomed to extinction (read, a phase the species is going through) on the enormous scale of whole populations. 26 The lineaments of openly genocidal malice behind this fantasy appear only occasionally in the respectable media, though they can be glimpsed even there behind the poker-face mask of our national experiment in laissez-faire medicine. A better, if still deodorized, whiff of that malice comes from the famous pronouncement of Pat Robertson: &quot;AIDS is God's way of weeding his garden.&quot; The saccharine luster this dictum gives to its vision of devastation, and the ruthless prurience with which it misattributes its own agency, cover a more fundamental contradiction: that, to rationalize complacent glee at a spectacle of what is imagined as genocide, a proto-Darwinian process of natural selection is being invoked—in the context of a Christian fundamentalism that is not only antievolutionist but recklessly oriented toward universal apocalypse. A similar phenomenon, also too terrible to be noted as a mere irony, is how evenly our culture's phobia about HIV-positive blood is kept pace with by its rage for keeping that dangerous blood in broad, continuous circulation. This is evidenced in projects for universal testing, and in the needle-sharing implicit in William Buckley's now ineradicable fantasy of tattooing HIV-positive persons. But most immediately and pervasively it is evidenced in the literal bloodbaths that seem to make the point of the AIDS-related resurgence in violent bashings of gays--which, unlike the gun violence otherwise ubiquitous in this culture, are characteristically done with two-by-fours, baseball bats, and fists, in the most literal-minded conceivable form of body-fluid contact. It might be worth making explicit that the use of evolutionary thinking in the current wave of utopian/genocidal fantasy is, whatever else it may be, crazy. Unless one believes, first of all, that same-sex object-choice across history and across cultures is one thing with one cause, and, second, that its one cause is direct transmission through a nonrecessive genetic path--which would be, to put it gently, counter-intuitive--there is no warrant for imagining that gay populations, even of men, in post-AIDS generations will be in the slightest degree diminished. Exactly to the degree that AIDS is a gay disease, it's a tragedy confined to our generation; the long-term demographic depredations of the disease will fall, to the contrary, on groups, many themselves direly endangered, that are reproduced by direct heterosexual transmission. Unlike genocide directed against Jews, Native Americans, Africans, or other groups, then, gay genocide, the once-and-for-all eradication of gay populations, however potent and sustained as a project or fantasy of modern Western culture, is not possible short of the eradication of the whole human species. The impulse of the species toward its own eradication must not either, however, be underestimated. Neither must the profundity with which that omnicidal impulse is entangled with the modern problematic of the homosexual: the double bind of definition between the homosexual, say, as a distinct risk group, and the homosexual as a potential of representation within the universal. 27 As gay community and the solidarity and visibility of gays as a minority population are being consolidated and tempered in the forge of this specularized terror and suffering, how can it fail to be all the more necessary that the avenues of recognition, desire, and thought between minority potentials and universalizing ones be opened and opened and opened?<br />

The alternative is to reject the aff’s worldview in favor of a queer theory based approach. Resistance must be constant, potentials must not be limited, and strategies must resist the normate.<br />
Steyaert 10 (Doctor in Psychology and Professor in Organizational Psychology at the University of St. Gallen (January 2010, Chris, Gender, Work and Organization., “Queering Space: Heterotopic Life in Derek Jarman’s Garden”, vol. 17, no. 1)<br />
The rich artistic output that Jarman realized under difficult circumstances was not possible without challenging the societal limits in which he worked artistically. The figure of the troubadour and the Harlequin announce a car- nivalesque form of resistance (Dey and Steyaert, 2007). The red thread that connects the personal, the artistic and the political is Jarman’s homosexuality. This makes it necessary to look at the care of the self as a practice of resistance and his gardening as a form of ‘queering space’. His art becomes the political activism that tries to form a minor language in an increasingly repressive discourse on homosexuality. However, since the seropositive diagnosis, the mood in which this activism is played out changed drastically, and [t]his time his mood would be Artaudian: it would take the form of a scream of rage, an attack on the gutter press and the moral low ground that British culture now occupied. (Morgan, 1996, p. 113) The care of the self aims not at some form of personal transformation, since it should be clear that heterotopic subjectivity is a ‘historical construct which cannot be understood outside relations of power and knowledge’ (Berard, 1999, p. 217). Jarman stretched the relation between his personal history and the ways in which various histories that he, as a gay person, had became part of, are usually told. Jarman worked as intensively on the limits which (British) society posed on him as well as on the limits that death entered on his life scene in the form of seropositivity. Like every gay person, taking care of himself was for Jarman as much a practical as a historical task. Just as for most other people becoming aware of being gay or lesbian forces you to deal with a setting of public practices and discourses that are filled with heterosexual expectations and models and that you need to resist, turn around and replace, without any clear set of alternative forms or practices available. Being mostly exposed to a heteronormative ideal of living, you have to (learn to) re-inscribe yourself into a history of a different sexuality and in the most practical sense find new practices of living and relating that are helpful to go on with your life ‘out of the closet’ (Brown, 2000). According to Foucault, resistance is focused on ‘the forms within which individuals are able, are obliged, to recognize themselves as subjects of this sexuality’ (Foucault, 1990b, p. 4). Perhaps resisting is not pleasant work, but it is clearly something that needs to be done repeatedly, daily, when you want to claim a space for oneself. Stonewall is the legendary symbol of gay resistance, the somewhat belated open opposition to those who wanted to take away even the small ghettos for gays. As a consequence, a little cafe in New York became a heterotopia for an act of resistance that was followed with an increasing amount of demonstrations, parades and (protest) marches, through which gay and lesbian people bring homosexuality out of the closet, or out of protected spaces, and visibly into the streets. Depicting exemplary demonstrations, processions and gatherings, Jarman made several references to this in his films, including The Garden and Edward II. The kind of liberating struggle that Jarman at that time practiced in his movies, paintings and artistic work in general comes close to the kind of ‘counterattack’ Foucault (1990) foresaw: It is the agency of sex that we must break away from, if we aim — through a tactical reversal of the various mechanisms of sexuality — to counter the grips of power with the claims of bodies, pleasures, and knowledges, in their multiplicity and their possibility of resistance. The rallying point for the counterattack against the deployment of sexuality ought not to be sex-desire, but bodies and pleasures. (Foucault, 1990a, p. 157; my emphasis)9 It is the dimension of resistance which in my view makes it feasible to connect the care of the self and the technologies of the self with the concept of queerness. According to Foucault (1982a) resistance is not just an act of negation, but a creative process. This includes as much the daily creative execution of living as the artistic option of creating an aesthetic track of one’s own. In the case of gay and lesbian resistance the creative process through which discursive realities are confronted has been captured by the term ‘queer’. The term ‘queer’ is itself heterotopic.10 It is at odds with definition and allergic to any kind of stabilizing, as it tries to escape the settling discourses and forms of living and is tending ‘toward “across” formulations: across genders, across sexualities, across genres, across “perversions” ’ (Kosofsky Sedgwick, quoted in Plonowska Ziarek, 1998, p. 18; italics in original). In an attempt to value the destabilizing character of the term queer, Halperin (1995) tries to develop a ‘queer’ politics based on Foucault’s work, drawing mainly on The History of Sexuality but also on several interviews Foucault gave in the 1980s to magazines for gay and lesbian audiences (such as The Advocate in 1982 and Christopher Street in 1981) and which have been collected in Part 4 of Dits et Ecrits (Foucault, 1994). According to Halperin (1995), homosexual emancipation and gay liberation imply a reversal of the discursive positioning of homosexuality and heterosexuality. Heterosexuality, which is in the position of a universal subject of discourse, needs to be interrogated and critiqued. Simultaneously homosexuality needs to shift from the position of an object of power/ knowledge ‘to a position of legitimate subjective agency’ (Halperin, 1995, p. 57). Queer activities and practices are thus trying to reverse the dominant position of a heterosexual discourse, which can never be considered as lacking what Foucault calls a tactical polyvalence. According to Foucault the world of discourse cannot be divided between accepted and excluded dis- course, or between the dominant and the dominated discourse, since [D]iscourses are not once and for all subservient to power or raised up against it, any more than silences are. We must make allowance for the complex and unstable process whereby discourse can be both an instru- ment and an effect of power, but also a hindrance, a stumbling-block, a point of resistance and a starting point for an opposing strategy. (Foucault, 1990a, pp. 100–1; my emphasis). The psychiatric discourse on homosexuality started being used in reverse to claim a position and to speak using the same categories but with opposite intentions, namely to start to claim a position which is not defined by oppo- sition to the heterosexual essence. It is here that queerness can be situated, and it is worthwhile to quote Halperin on this at length as he convincingly argued that to shift the position of ‘the homosexual’ requires making available to lesbians and gay men a new kind of sexual identity, one char- acterised by its lack of a clear definitional content. The homosexual subject can now claim an identity without an essence. To do so is to reverse the logic of the supplement and to make use of the vacancy left by the evacu- ation of the contradictory and incoherent definitional content of ‘the homo- sexual’ in order to take up instead a position that is (and always had been) defined wholly relationally, by its distance to and difference from the nor- mative. (Homo)sexual identity can now be constituted not substantively but oppositionally, not by what it is but by where it is and how it operates. Those who knowingly occupy such a marginal location, who assume a de-essentialised identity that is purely positional in character, are properly speaking not gay but queer. (1995, pp. 61–2; emphasis in original) Becoming queer is then turning the position of the gay, struggling with ‘coming out’ into an open positionality, where new possibilities for living and relating (to oneself and others) emerge. Queer can refer to a whole set of (sometimes eccentric) technologies of the self — which can not be defined substantively or even illustrated — where the space for development is inventively explored, never occupied. It is a space of concrete freedom, for self- styling and self-transforming. The care of the self, as a queer project, engenders a new strategic possibility for the self. Transformation is a matter of form where we play out ourselves in the field of institutional games (Foucault, 1995b). The politics and practice of queer resistance consists thus in the playful experimenting with new forms of relationships and in expanding possibilities of relational practices at the limits of established social orders. The breaking out of relationships as defined by heteronormativity is not so much a matter of redefining a new, this time homosexual, norm, but of leaving you in an open field in which to concoct new forms of relating and living together. Foucault described being gay in an open, becoming mode, which sounds to me very similar to the notion of ‘queer’ that was not yet in vogue in Foucault’s time: to be gay is to be in a state of becoming ... the point is not to be homosexual but to keep working persistently at being gay ... to place oneself in a dimension where the sexual choices one makes are present and have their effects on the ensemble of our life ... These sexual choices ought to be at the same time creators of ways of life. To be gay signifies that these choices diffuse themselves across the entire self; it is also a certain manner of refusing the modes of life offered, it is to make a sexual choice into the impetus for a change of existence. (Foucault, 1982b, p. 24) Queering one’s life is not just a matter of having done with heterosexual life forms, but Foucault seemed to believe that these experimentations might open up and inspire the social fabric of affecting and relating in general. He pleaded to resist the kind of relationships society proposes and thought that queer practices might bring along new relational possibilities that can also enrich the lives of non-homosexual people (Foucault, 1981). Foucault deemed such experimentation and ongoing formation of queering and othering rela- tionships indispensable but also improbable, since most of us are not willing to deal with such an open and complex relational life. Queering space can thus counter the impoverishment of the relational world, since in effect, we live in a legal, social, and institutional world where the only relations possible are extremely few, extremely simplified, and extremely poor.<br />

 What environmental imapcts are important? The affirmative presents you with a hierarchy of environmental importance. This hierarchy produces a world wherein homosexuals and non-whites are toxic. This epistemology tragically mirrors the worst colonialist genocides. Their strategy destroys the potential for coalition building.<br />
Gosine 10 (Andil, Associate Professor of Sociology at York, 4/28/2010, “Non-white Reproduction and Same-Sex Eroticism: Queer Acts against Nature”, Queer ecologies: sex, nature, politics, desire, p.155-9, MH)<br />
The denunciation of homosexuality shares much in common with the attacks on the fertility and potentially reproductive sexualities of non-white men and women. First, nature stands in for nation in both narratives, an easy epistemological substitution, as nations have the same requirements as “healthy environments”: reproductive species and resistance to the incursions of foreign bodies. As Sarah Ahmed suggests, “a good or healthy neighbourhood [or nation] does not leak outside itself, and hence does not let outsiders (or foreign agents/viruses) in” (2000, 25). There is, she adds, “no body as such that is given in the world: bodies materialize in a complex set of temporal and spatial relations to other bodies, including bodies that are recognized as familiar and friendly, and those that are considered strange” (40). In white nationalist projects, including European colonization, homosexuals and non-white reproductive heterosexuals are “strange”; they make no contribution to the building and expansion of—and in fact threaten—white nations. Their significance derives instead from their manifestations of oppositional subjects, as the Others through whom the white subject can make sense of himself (for the “normal” human subject is always a biological male), and upon whom anxieties about identity may be focused. The articulation of nature within a white, nationalist framework, furthermore, produces homosexuals and non-whites as not just strange, but toxic. Working with Ahmed’s theorization of nationalism, Berila points out that “who and what counts as toxic is . . . deeply contested ground” (2005, 130). “Since the bodies of particular others, usually people of color, queers, women, or people from other nations, are repeatedly targeted as threats to the nation,” she adds, “the reading of which bodies are marked as toxic seems particularly important in any discussion of the landscapes of nation and national identity” (130). Nationalism is always predicated on racialized heterosexuality, as the survival of nations demands the reproduction of bodies. It is for this reason that women have been regarded in nationalist discourses as objects of both reverence and slippage; they are biological reproducers of the nation, but any sexual transgressions on their part (lesbianism, interracial sex) mean that they also threaten its survival (Anthias, Yuval-Davis, and Cain 1992). The most expansive project of white nationalism, the colonization of North America, has been deeply informed by and achieved through the generation of responses to anxieties about homosexuality and the sexual liberties of non-white heterosexuals. Historian Ned Katz notes that “the widespread homosexuality of the North American Indians was given as an excuse by the invading whites for their extermination” and “the Christianization of Native Americans and the colonial appropriation of the continent by white, Western ‘civilization’ included the attempt by the conquerors to eliminate various traditional forms of<br />
Indian homosexuality—as part of their attempt to destroy that Native culture that might fuel resistance—a form of cultural genocide involving both Americans and Gay people” (quoted in Gaard 1998, 33). White homosexual subjects betrayed the nation’s reproductive imperative. The threat of non-white homosexual subjects to the nation was differently rationalized. They were problematic by virtue of their apparent potential to attract and “homo-sexualize” whites. Stoler notes that during the colonial period, “desires for opulence and sex, wealth and excess were repeatedly attributed to creole Dutch and lower-class Europeans, to those with culturally hybrid affiliations and/or of mixed-blood origin.” Natives and these “fictive” Europeans, Stoler adds, were “persons ruled by their sexual desires” (1995, 183). The “homosexual native” and the “native woman” represented temptation, and threatened to unravel the European’s self-discipline, unleashing his darkest fantasies. These anxieties laid the groundwork for the theories of racialization that would emerge in the nineteenth century, such as those posited by Count Gobineau in his “Essay on the Equality of Races.” Gobineau’s core argument was that it was the white races who are inclined to be sexually attracted toward the other races, which is why they mix with them, while yellow and brown races were deemed to have a stronger repulsion to interracial sex, which is why, he says, they tended to remain relatively unmixed (quoted in Young 1995, 107). Indeed, nineteenth-century theories of race did not just consist of essentializing differentiations between self and other but also were, as Young points out, broadly about “a fascination with people having sex—interminable, adulterating, aleatory, illicit, inter-racial sex” (181). Such racial theory, Young argues, “projected a phantasmagoria of the desiring machine [of colonialism] as a people factory.” There were great fears about uncontrollable, frenetic fornication producing the countless motley varieties of interbreeding, with the miscegenated offspring themselves then generating an ever increasing melange, “mongrelity,” of self-propagating endlessly diversifying hybrid progeny: half-blood, half-caste, half-breed, cross-breed, amalgamate, intermix, miscegenate, alvino,<br />
cabre, cafuso, castizo, cholo, chino, cob, creole, dustee, fustee, griffe, mamaluco. (181) Subsequent to the fall of European empires, these anxieties took new shape as anti-immigration discourses (“Yellow Fever,” “Asian Invasion,” etc.) and, as already noted, overpopulation propaganda. More recently, postindustrial concerns about environmental degradation have provided another prism through which xenophobia and racism could be articulated as environmental prudence. But make no mistake about it: Calls by groups such as the Sierra Club (U.S.)—some of them made as recently as 2006—to curb immigration and regulate the sexual reproduction of people in the Global South are merely a restatement of white nationalist ideals as a commitment to nature. This analysis is supported by research demonstrating North American environmentalists’ commitment to white nationalist constructions of nature. As Noël Sturgeon points out, mainstream environmentalists, in their emphasis on wilderness, species extinction, and in general seeing the environment as excluding human beings, often fall into service to this dominant Western logic of seeing the natural as pure, unchanging, untainted by social influence and without history. This kind of mainstream environmentalism avoids environmental justice issues, which deal primarily with problems of human and community health using a broader, less reified definition of the environment and identifying power relations as central to the cause of environmental problems. (2004, 263) Nature needs protection, this logic forwards, from the toxic presence of non-white bodies. Coverage of arrests of men engaged in or looking for sex in natural spaces similarly reveals nature’s parallel constitution (with nation) as a pure space that must be protected from the incursions of toxic homosexuals. One commonly employed strategy toward this effect has been to equate sex with pollution, and to focus on the litter and damage to the environment produced by homosexual acts. A news report filed by Sarah Lemagie for the Star Tribune on the Minnesota arrests provides one illustration of this approach. Lemagie begins the article by associating gay sex with garbage. “The trash-strewn pulloffs along the Minnesota River hardly look like Lovers’ Lane,” she notes, “but to Burnsville police who have been tracking lewd behavior between men there, that’s basically what they’ve become.” Writing about a popular cruising spot at Maple Grove, she quotes an officer who makes note of the damage men seeking sex inflict on the environment and litter they leave behind. “Men loitered in cars or at picnic benches and retreated in pairs to the bushes,” where officers found mattresses and “condoms by the hundreds,” she reports him as saying. In Canada, an article about male cruising in Stanley Park that appeared in the Vancouver Sun in 2001 reported, “Venture down one of the well-worn side paths into the trees and you can’t miss it. The soggy ground is carpeted with used condoms, their wrappers, and tissues, the tell-tale remnants of what is widely known in the male gay community as park sex” (Zacharias 2001, A1). A June 2007 story appearing in the National Post repeated this association of homosexual sex with pollution of natural space, and condemned police for not taking punitive action. “Visitors to one part of famous Stanley Park may stumble upon men engaged in fellatio and intercourse,” columnist Brian Hutchinson noted, “yet cruising areas, littered with used condoms and cigarette butts, seem sacrosanct” (Hutchison 2007, A1). Similarly, a report filed by Peter Baker for the Essex Chronicle focuses on the outrage expressed by Brian Olley in encountering homosexual acts taking place in Hylands Park. According to the article, park user Brian Olley “exercises his dog in Hylands by walking from his nearby home twice a day” (2006, 11). Although he had often seen “vehicles with male occupants park outside the main gate [to the Hylands]” on most evenings, he was “shocked to come across two men having sex on a path he used to walk his dog by the park’s edge” (11). Olley, Barker reports, has noticed “there is unsavoury litter around the entrance area” frequented by men looking for sex. The Hylands estate manager is also quoted as saying, “The condoms and tissues presumably get deposited on the highway and in lay-bys” (11). This littering of parks is akin to “dirtying the nation,” particularly in light of the historical constitution of parks as part of white nation-building. More recently, moral dangers about both homosexuality and non-white reproductive heterosexuality have been stated through the production of ecological discourses. In Malthusian renderings of environmentalism, the planet’s demise is linked to the immoral ravishes of the polluting underclass. Sandilands notes that population discourse “relies on the bifurcation of the world into two: ‘good’ ecological citizens, who have listened to and understood the call for limits and do not require (further) regulatory intervention, and unruly bodies, who have not, might not and/or do not” (1999, 86). Nature has similarly been used as a means of production and site of moral regulation against homosexual sex, such as in the representation of public sex as polluting. Sandilands explains, “Bulldozing the trees or pulling up the undergrowth in a downtown park can be as much a threat to the public expression of gay male culture as it is to urban nature, and polluting a beach that acts as a center for outdoor lesbian activity can destroy both biotic and social communities” (2001, 175). Sandilands concludes that mainstream environmentalism, such as that involved in the creation of urban parks, “includes a strong historical tradition of marginalizing sexual expression; in order to approach moral purity, sexuality was excluded” (Ingram, quoted in Sandilands 2001, 176). A 2005 U.S. Department of Justice guidebook entitled Illicit Sexual Activity in Public Places, produced by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, makes clear the equation of immoral with environmental transgressions insofar as homosexuality is concerned. Issued as part of a series that aims to “summarize knowledge about how police can reduce the harm caused by specific crime and disorder problems” (v)<br />

Our alternative is to affirm a politics of queer ecocriticism. This entails a questioning of what it means to be natural to resist traditional forms of domination. Only this strategy has the potential to build mass coalitions to fix the environment.<br />
Hogan 10 (Katie, Professor of English and Director of Women’s Studies at Carlow University, 7/14/2010, “Undoing Nature: Coalition Building as Queer Environemtnalism”, Queer ecologies: sex, nature, politics, desire, p232-3, MH)<br />
In response to repeated condemnations, queer activists, theorists, artists, writers, and filmmakers—with impressive critical force, ingenuity, and creativity—have directed intense theoretical and activist attention to the undoing of the natural and unnatural. This body of work challenges not only heteronormativity, but uncritical nature-based arguments and ideologies. A fully conscious queer ecocritique, as Timothy Morton suggests above, is precisely what contemporary ecocriticism needs. In fact, Morton calls for a “partnership between queer theory and ecological criticism,” a collaboration that he says “is long overdue” (Morton 2007, 186). Similarly, although focusing on affinities between ecocriticism and postmodernism, scholar Peter Quigley echoes Morton’s ideas in “Nature as Dangerous Space” (1999). In this article, Quigley urges ecocriticism to critically rethink nature: “If nature could be seen as a force that disrupts, overwhelms, undermines, explodes or otherwise ‘makes strange’ our ideological consensus, our anthropocentrism, then it is possible to see it as an agent of criticism” (198). Treating nature as criticism means revealing the hidden ideologies, assumptions, and politics of the term. Queer ecocritique shares in these scholars’ determined skepticism about discourses of nature and environmentalism, not because queers are innately urban and “hate” nature or environmentalism, or because nature and environmentalism are “naturally” oppressive to queers, but because queer theories are designed to challenge the assumption that nature and the natural are neutral, independent categories exempt from critical challenge. Queer ecocritique takes the alleged “against nature-ness” of queers as the focus of its work. Whether formally recognized or not, a queer ecocritique is a powerful contribution to ecocriticism and environmental justice theory and activism; it keeps the focus on how the seemingly innocent realm of nature and ecological protection is potentially rife with ideology and violence. Queer ecocriticism relentlessly uncovers nature as, to quote again from Quigley, “a weapon of oppression,” thus offering a critical practice from which to build theoretical partnerships and multi-issue political actions (1999, 202). Quigley sees this oppressive aspect right alongside an activist potential too when he writes that nature is also “a place to gather strength against the forces of domination” (201–202). In other words, nature is an opportunity to build theoretical overlaps and an opportunity for activist coalitions among seemingly disparate groups and communities. In Eight Bullets: One Woman’s Story of Surviving Anti-Gay Violence by Claudia Brenner and Hannah Ashley (1995), Brenner evokes Quigley’s vision of nature as both weapon of oppression and place “to gather strength.” A queer memoir about a hate crime that resulted in the murder of Brenner’s life partner during the couple’s hike on the Appalachian Trail in eastern Pennsylvania, Eight Bullets unwittingly demonstrates a queer ecocritique by recording the consequences of heteronormative ideas of nature and environment—that queer groups and individuals do not deserve to be in nature because they are “unnatural”—and by responding with images of queer cultures in nature to resist “the forces of domination.” Using nature as a chance to fight domination is specifically voiced in the following statement of the design of the murdered queer woman’s memorial service: “Evelyn and Rebecca’s closest friends had planned this memorial service, deliberately choosing a beautiful, outdoor place both to honor Rebecca’s love of nature and to reclaim the outdoors after her murder. The clearing seemed to grow to the perfect size for the huge circle of over 150 people who had come to celebrate her life” (Brenner and Ashley 1995, 104–105). Queer ecocritique not only shows us how to undermine and challenge the “against nature” ideology eloquently charted in Eight Bullets; it also highlights how queer texts create interesting and resistant political cultures using nature as an organizing focus.<br />

This pacified and disarmed consciousness or alienation in Marxian terms - has allowed the managers of the national security superstate to shift both their military doctrine and hardware toward making nuclear war more thinkable, more fightable, and more 'winnable'. The resultant expectations of nuclear war do not augur well, for, as social psychologist Gordon Allport put it: 'The greatest menace to the world today are leaders in office who regard war as inevitable and thus prepare their people for armed conflict. For by regarding war as inevitable, it becomes inevitable. Expectations determine behavior' (Allport 1968, p. 11).<br />

Adams 11 – *Lecturer in Education and Program Director, Centre for Educational Studies, Univ. of Hull (Paul, “From ‘ritual’ to ‘mindfulness’: policy and pedagogic positioning,” Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education, January 2011, 32: 1, 57-69,)<br />
With such concerns, and many others in mind, it has become fashionable to describe policy in terms of discourse. Whilst by no means an agreed field (cf. Bacchi, 2000) policy as discourse does provide grounds for further consideration of the interplay between policy creation and response. As a challenge to the view that policy, as a manifestation of knowledge, arises either in the individual or in the natural world, we can consider the work of Kenneth Gergen (1995) and his proposal that all knowing arises in the social processes of language use and meaning-making. Here, rather than construe policy as the accurate expression of dispassionate, unbiased observations, such a view shifts our relationship with policy from a means by which the individual might comprehend the significance of the policy statement in terms of truth to an understanding that the language used within the policy statements itself actively constructs the world to which it pertains. Put another way, Gergen’s view invites us to consider policy as having a ‘performative’ function and that that presented is neither a true representation of reality nor an accurate reflection of intent. Accordingly, policy can no longer be simply said to be understood and applied. Alternatively, this perspective construes policy as a representation of the interplay between the policy text (the material embodiment of the policy document and associated forms), discursive practices involved in the production, distribution and consumption of policy, and wider social practices which delineate, for example ‘professional’ and, indeed, other roles and associated activities. This view acknowledges the parts played by history and culture in determining specific ways of viewing the world whilst illuminating how understanding is dependent upon prevailing social and economic arguments (after Burr, 2003). Policy, then, should not be seen as an accurate portrayal of some pre-existing status but is, rather, a social construction given legitimacy through the permission it gives to speak. Policy as discourse is, therefore, an interplay between ‘conceptual schema attached to specific historical, institutional and cultural contexts . . . [and] . . . the differential power of some actors’ (Bacchi, 2000, p. 52) to act. With this in mind, it is clear that professional actions undertaken in relation to policy appear, not as objective responses to positions of truth, but rather as subjective realisations borne out of cultural, historical, economic and social specificity. Policy as discourse attends to both the uses and effects of policy insomuch as it considers the influences pertaining to the creation of the policy text, the mechanisms by which this is imported into the professional lifeworld and the prevailing social conditions which form the very language used to describe the policy itself, as well as associated roles and identities; in short, policy as social construction. This view is not new; much has been written from this perspective. On this matter, Bacchi notes the tendency of this perspective to: Concentrate on the ability of some groups rather than others to make discourse, and on some groups rather than others as effected or constituted in discourse. To put the point briefly, those who are deemed to ‘hold’ power are portrayed as the ones making discourse, whereas those who are seen as ‘lacking’ power are described as constituted in discourse. (2000, p. 52) This redistribution of voice constitutes certain voices as meaningful or authoritative (Ball, 2006, p. 49). This social construction of policy requires an appreciation that the processes of problematisation and argumentation are the lifeblood of policy existence. The lenses offered by history, culture and economics through which ‘problems’ to be solved are identified determine not only the mechanisms by which ‘reality’ might be understood but also the very ‘problems’ themselves. Further, it is through the process of argumentation that certain solutions are presented as viable alternatives. Crucially, as Hastings (1998, p. 194) notes, this ‘highlights the instrumentality of the process of problem construction not only to successful policy making, but also to sustaining systems of belief about the nature of social reality’. Problem construction is, then, ‘as much a way of knowing and a way of acting strategically as a form of description’ (Edelman, 1988, p. 36). In this regard, policy as discourse establishes a number of key principles. First, it articulates a view that ‘problems’ do not exist as pre-human issues to be addressed but rather that they are the products of political reasoning located in economic, social, cultural and historical ways of viewing the world. Second, that these lenses also provide the means by which solutions, that is to say the pronouncements ‘captured’ as policy imperatives, might be constructed. Third, and most importantly, policy as discourse, through its recognition of cultural, historical, economic and social specificity, constrains the scope of both policy construction and policy response (Ball, 2006). Put briefly, discourse presents a variety of representations from which action might be chosen: Discourses are about what can be said, and thought, but also about who can speak, when, where and with what authority. Discourses embody the meaning and use of propositions and words. Thus certain possibilities for thought are constructed. (Ball, 2006, p. 48) This world-to-person fit describes the ‘subject position’, determined by the availability of dominant discourses. Interpretational options are thus taken to be both pre-existing and available to the subject. In such a view, human agency occurs through the deployment of the subject’s exercise of choice from the discourses available. In short, through the act of locating oneself within a frame of predetermined potentialities, the subject is said to exercise agentic action.<br />

U.S. schools. At both local and national levels, conservative groups are gaining more and more influence over education, helping to develop and impose “standards” that prescribe what students are to learn and even how teachers are to teach. Perhaps not surprisingly, these standards are quite problematic: They reinforce only certain ways of making sense of ourselves and the world in which we live, especially ways that ignore or even justify an inequitable status quo. Students are not often learning things that help them to recognize and challenge the different forms of oppression that are already in play in schools and society. This needs to change. I am not suggesting that we abandon what we currently teach and replace it with “better” standards of the “correct” perspectives and knowledges and skills. Any set of standards will be partial, that is, will be defined by only certain people to include only certain things. Even perspectives that critique social inequities cannot help but be partial, offering only certain ways of thinking about oppression and social change that can themselves be critiqued. Instead, I am suggesting that troubling the standards already in place requires teaching and learning about this partial nature of standards. It requires teaching and learning that different perspectives and knowledges and skills can have different political implications–some that maintain an oppressive status quo of society, but some that challenge it, and some that suggest very different social possibilities. It requires challenging ways that the standards normalize only certain ways of teaching and define all others as pretty queer ways to teach. Standards often function in similar ways in higher education, even among academics committed to social justice. Higher education often places higher value on only certain kinds of research, such as those that use “valid” methodologies or draw on “credible” literature or appear in “reputable” journals. It places higher value on only certain kinds of teaching, such as those that conform to commonsense ideas of “good” teaching or those that have been “proven” effective by research. It places higher value on only certain ways of being a professor, such as those that involve “required” forms of service that do not “detract” from official responsibilities. In contrast, it does not often value research that explores alternative ways to know or alternative ways to write, or teaching that explores alternatives meanings of “teaching” and “learning,” or service endeavors that explore alternative ways of impacting schools and local communities. And this is the case, despite the decades of research that points to the oppressions already in play in academia, including in these common and commonsense approaches to research, teaching, and service. “Being” a college or university professor often requires repeating what others have already asserted to be the best or most important ways to research, teach, and serve, which do not often center explicitly on issues of social justice. Sometimes informally and sometimes not, standards of higher education often suggest that being a professor who focuses on challenging different forms of oppression is a pretty queer way to be. There is something significant, then, about the “queer” in education. There is something significantly disruptive about those educational practices that some in society want to silence. This is where I find much value in queer theory. I find that queer theory has much to offer those of us working to change the fields of educational research and practice in our movements toward social justice. It is not without tension that I draw on queer theory, especially as an activist committed to challenging multiple forms of oppression in schools and society. A number of activists and academics have suggested that the term “queer,” when used as a term of self-empowerment, does not apply to some people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersexed, such as those who are also of color. They tell us that the politics surrounding queer identities and movements may be working to trouble the normalcy of certain social markers like gender and sexual orientation, but are simultaneously reinforcing the marginalization of other markers like race. The result is that groups traditionally privileged in mainstream society remain privileged even in marginalized and activist communities, as with White Americans in queer movements. Queer politics is too often colored by Eurocentrism. This should not be surprising– eurocentrism (as with other “isms”) is often the norm in countless aspects of our lives, and its everydayness or commonsense nature makes it difficult to be recognized, much less challenged, no matter what the context. Challenging the multiple oppressions in our lives requires challenging the many norms that privilege and marginalize different groups or simply different ways of being. Even queer movements have internal work to do, and perhaps always will. After all, queer politics are all about disrupting what has become “normal.” Queer politics do not only celebrate difference, as when asserting that, Yes, we are queer and are not what society says is normal. Queer politics also critique the standards that define certain things as “different” in the first place, as when asserting that, No, we do not even want to be “normal” because society’s definition of normal is a pretty oppressive way to be. And this does not only apply to sex and sexuality. The bases for critiquing what is normal (everyday) and normative (required) may have arisen in response to the ways that “alternative” sexual orientations and gender expressions get called “queer,” but there do exist many forms of oppression that define certain things as the norm and all other things as queer. In fact, queer politics are premised on the notion that norms of society require the existence of things queer. Some things cannot be normal if other things are not already abnormal. Queerness is not a natural state of being. Rather, queerness is produced as a contrast, as that against which normalcy is established. This production of queerness is always happening. Even our work within queer politics–from our theorizing to our street activism–cannot help but normalize only certain identities or ideas or practices while defining all others as too queer. Little effort is required to find instances of things that seem too queer even for queer politics, as when “we” do not want to address certain sexual practices or racialized bodies or other differences because they will “detract” from our goals. Queer movements can marginalize certain ways of being (too) queer even while challenging the marginalization of other ways of being (acceptably) queer. Our work, then, is quite paradoxical: it constitutes movements that both challenge and contribute to different forms of oppression. It requires constantly problematizing the ways that we may unintentionally normalize only certain ways of being queer. It prevents us from thinking that our identities or our work or our end products are ever fully “queer,” and instead insists that we see queerness as ideals that never solidify because, once grasped, they tend towards normalcy. As I bring these insights to bear on the troubling movements in U.S. schools, I am reminded of the importance of embracing the paradoxical nature of challenging oppression. As teachers and learners, we need to examine how all approaches to teaching and learning are partial, including those approaches that center on social justice. We need to examine how the things we learn can be useful for improving our lives as well as how they can contribute to oppression in often invisible ways. And we need to examine both the normalizing and the queering of what and how we teach, and why this might be the case. I feel discomforted by the notion that queer movements in education should never end, and yet, such a realization is exactly what gives me hope for a future less colored by oppression.<br />

In addition to various laws–which are inextricably linked to, and often result from, the dominant U.S. political system and other U.S. institutions, for that matter–mainstream politics have exerted enormous pressure to maintain the status quo as far as sexual matters are concerned. Gore Vidal (1983) states, “The sexual attitudes of any given society are the result of political decisions” (p. 152). Politics are a part of our very existence, and create, support and perpetuate dominant culture. The fiercely debated issues such as equal rights, abortion, homosexuality, sexuality education, and so on “. . . are hot issues that affect not only the political process but the private lives of millions of people” (Vidal, 1983, p. 150). Politics, then, contribute substantially to the conservative status quo agenda.<br />

 Militarism is rooted in Hegemonic masculinity—legitimizes militaristic violence<br />

I was born in England in 1956 and have lived there all my life. I have never seen any form of military service and have never worked for the Ministry of Defence. I have never lived in or even visited a military base. Indeed, the closest I have ever come to military culture is learning how to march and drill when I was in the junior section of the Boys' Brigade for three or four years. Furthermore, because all Britain's wars during my lifetime have been fought entirely on foreign soil, I have no firsthand experience of warfare of any kind. Nevertheless, although I have strong sympathies with pacifist politics and am repulsed by warmongering politicians, I am fascinated by military culture and admit to sometimes admiring soldiers for some of the work they are expected to do. I am also impressed by the actions of soldiers and other armed forces personnel who distinguish themselves in battle. Furthermore, I am aware that some of my own ideas about what it means to be masculine, to be a man, have been shaped by ideologies of militarism. Yet, those aspects of military culture that celebrate the use of lethal violence and glamorize war disturb me. In this chapter I explore the cultural influences that have informed my contradictory attitudes toward militarism and discuss how those cultural influences may be beginning to change. There are four central themes to this chapter. First, militarist ideals represent the most extreme expression of the values of what Connell terms hegemonic masculinity.1 Second, although state militarist policies are most evident in saber-rattling foreign policy, there are also more subtle militarist influences on public policy that are particularly evident in debates about law and order. Third, state militarist policies have traditionally played a major role in promoting and reinforcing ideologies that shape popular conceptions of what it means to be masculine and manipulate such ideologies to gain support 112 for use of violence by the state. Fourth, the 1990s represented a turning point in the relationship between masculinity and militarism as women service personnel became better integrated into the culture, structure, and role of the armed services while the collapse of the Soviet bloc and new technologies transformed the nature of warfare. Writers who have developed critiques of masculinity suggest that there is a form of masculine identity (hegemonic masculinity) that boys and men are generally encouraged to aspire to.2 This form of masculinity is characterized by the interrelationship of stoicism,3 phallocentricity and the domination of weaker individuals,4 competitiveness and heroic achievement.5 Thus, men who exemplify this model of masculinity tend to be accorded a higher social status than those who do not.6 By publicly demonstrating that he has at least the potential to conform to this model of masculinity, a boy or man may have his masculinity affirmed. Military organizations, military successes, military pageantry, and rituals such as the &quot;passing out&quot; parades for successful recruits to the armed forces represent the public endorsement of such values and their institutionalization in national culture. Certainly, there exist other manifestations of this process of celebrating masculinity, but uniquely the exploits of the military are always openly and aggressively celebrated in the public sphere. Indeed, there are echoes of militarism in everyday language. For example, &quot;Dunkirk spirit&quot;? is a shorthand term for expressing admiration for someone's unwillingness to accept defeat; whereas someone who is finally defeated after a lengthy struggle may be said to have &quot;met their Waterloo.&quot;8 Furthermore, boys encounter many militarist influences during their childhood and adolescence. Although there are exceptions to the rule,9 uniformed youth organizations for boys tend to explicitly reflect military culture. For example, the organization, uniforms, and culture of the Boy Scout movement reflect the military background of its founder, Robert Baden-Powell. Similarly, from the very beginning, military-style drilling was a core activity of the Boys' Brigade to the extent that its founder, William Smith, originally introduced wooden dummy rifles into these activities. Whereas the use of wooden rifles was abandoned relatively early on in the Boys' Brigade's history, drilling remained a core activity within a military structure of brigade, battalions, and companies together with a quasi-military hierarchy of officers and non-commissioned officers retained to this day.lO More explicitly, the various army, air, and sea cadet forces in Britain, which offer young people opportunities to participate in many adventure activities and sports at low cost,11 are supported by the Ministry of Defence. These and other similar organizations have played a key role in exporting a culture equating masculinity and militarism from the public schools, where the link between militarism and 113 masculinity first became institutionalized,12 to boys from the middle and working classe5.B Although not all boys and men will ever have any connection with uniformed youth organizations such as the Boy Scouts or the Boys' Brigade, most will be aware of the cultural values such organizations promote. For example, they will probably develop social and professional relationships with men who have been associated with such organizations and internalized at least some of the values they promote. Thus, a shared understanding of masculinity will be influenced by these values.<br />

 Representing international law as weakened and needing to live up to responsibilities creates the law as a family man. Identifying the problem as one of masculinity changes the way we look for solutions.<br />
Buss 7 (Doris, Associate Professor of Law at Carleton University, 3/29/07, “Queering International Legal Authority”, Queering International Law, p. 6-7, MH)<br />
International law’s crisis is understood in gendered terms. Metaphors of masculinity, and its failings, are peppered throughout the Agora. The overwhelming image is of an emasculated international law, although the contributors diverge on the source of this emasculation. For some,8 international law’s possible irrelevance results from its own institutional lack of ‘‘collective spine.’’ Others9 see an ‘‘enormously weakened’’ international law, with a history of ‘‘ineffectual responses’’ to the scourge and ravages of international bad men. Many contributors paint a picture of a world that ‘‘is a dangerous, unruly, far too lightly managed and policed place.’’10 Against the dark, rogue masculinity of the world’s ‘‘bad men,’’ the ‘‘fragile normative structure’’11 of international law has been dealt a further blow by the Bush Administration. For Thomas Franck, ‘‘the fig leaf of legal justification’’ for use of force has been ‘‘all but discarded.’’12 And herein lies the real crisis as depicted in the Agora: what will international law do in the face of this challenge to its authority, with its masculine pretensions—and failings—now on display for all to see? If, as the Agora contributors imply, international law in its ‘‘weakened and ineffectual’’ persona has just had sand kicked in its face by the bully on the beach (the Bush Administration), does it have the masculine fortitude to respond? The Agora contributors diverge on what a remasculated international law looks like. Ruth Wedgwood’s contribution echoes current conceptions of international law and its future. Wedgwood argues a promising future awaits, one where international law—quoting Kofi Annan—‘‘faces its responsibilities’’ and is ‘‘strengthened by commitments to human rights and democracy.’’13 To get to this brighter future, international law must change course; it must, says Wedgwood, ‘‘rise to the occasion’’ to ‘‘retain its authority.’’14 This language of responsibility and the more satisfying masculinity of a proactive international law is, of course, much in vogue and calls to mind examples like the Canadian government’s campaign for the ‘‘responsibility to protect’’ doctrine. Even U.S. President George Bush uses the language of responsibility to justify American use of force in the Middle East.15 Responsibility, particularly as it is invoked in the use-of-force context, anchors a new vision of international law’s authority in terms reminiscent of Koskenniemi’s Law the Father. The reinvigorated international law that ‘‘rises to the occasion’’ and ‘‘lives up to its responsibilities’’ is a new age law; sensitive, caring, but responsible. This is Law the Family Man. While the Agora contributions can be read as entrenched in and constitutive of gendered expectations of authority and responsibility, they also reflect a heteronormative world view. International law may be struggling to express its masculine authority, but the challenges facing international law, as depicted in the Agora, only take shape as crises when placed within the iconography of the nuclear family. That is, the threats to the future of international law, the gaps in its normative reach, become critical when constituting a threat to the authority of Law the Father. And if convictions about international law’s crises are rooted in heteronormative ways of understanding, then the subsequent debates about the future of international law may be similarly tethered to a vision of responsible patrimony.<br />

 Calls for a stronger space program, decries of the private sector failure, and fear of a general lack fix space policy into a masculine heteronomrative framework<br />
Griffin 9 (Penny, Senior Lecturer - Convenor, MA International Relations, ‘The Spaces Between Us: The Gendered Politics of Outer Space’, in Bormann, N. and Sheehan, M. (eds), Securing Outer Space. London and New York: Routledge, p. 63, MH)<br />
As critics increasingly condemned Eisenhower’s apparently passive and unconcerned leadership for being ‘old-fashioned’ and ‘out of touch’ (McDougall 1985:7), a particular political discourse began to emerge in the US, founded on a certain type of sexual metaphor and the assertion of virile, heterosexual masculinity, led by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. These were both men heavily indoctrinated in the myths and ethos of patriotic frontier masculinity, and who placed at the heart of their politics the virtue of capturing the New Frontier. This reshaping of masculinity, alluding to the ‘pioneer’ adventurers of the old ‘Wild West’ but heavily predicated on mastering the technologies of space exploration, rejected the apparent discoordination of the private sector and the stagnancy of consumerism that, many believed, had caused complacency and heaped embarrassment on the US. Just as the American West had signalled freedom and a virile optimism to expansive, US frontier masculinity (see Hooper 2001:68–69), so the conquest and colonization of space provided a suitably challenge-filled outlet to revive the frustrated masculinity of late 1950s America. In all this, US political discourse was fuelled by a fear of emasculation through Soviet achievement and a national paranoia that the US might be perceived, by others and itself, as in any sense weak, complacent, showing any kind of ‘missile gap’, or aspect of ‘lack’. Eisenhower’s more careful and restrained approach was quickly replaced with Kennedy’s cult of masculine prowess, a career premised, as Dean articulates, on an ‘ideology of masculinity’ constructed around culturally resonant images of the ‘stoic warrior-intellectual’ (Dean 2001:169). The late 1950s was a period of massive US self-doubt, propelled by what Michaud refers to as ‘a surge of discourses on emasculation and feminized conformity’ (2005:4). Kennedy’s assertion (written in The Nation, before he announced he was to run for his party’s nomination to presidential candidate), that the US had ‘gone soft: physically, mentally, spiritually soft’; that the US was ‘in danger of losing our will to fight, to sacrifice, to endure’ and that the ‘slow corrosion of luxury is beginning to show’, found great sway across America, an assertion, as Dean illustrates, of manly strength against feminized weakness, youth against age, stoic austerity against debilitating luxury (2001:170). Kennedy’s immediate focus on the ‘space gap’ signaled the announcement of a more militaristically virile engagement. Space exploration thus became a central policy tenet of the Kennedy government, with the operation to get a US astronaut on the Moon a means of reasserting US authority and avenging any doubts as to the administration’s ability to perform. While the USSR operated a single military space programme, tending to classify many of the (at least earlier) processes of its development of space technology, the US elected a different approach, one that intentionally and actively separated the public and private of space colonization through the creation of so-called ‘civilian’ programmes (ostensibly, more open to the public) run by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), such as the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon, and the more secretive<br />

 What environmental imapcts are important? The affirmative presents you with a hierarchy of environmental importance. This hierarchy produces a world wherein homosexuals and non-whites are toxic. This epistemology tragically mirrors the worst colonialist genocides. Their strategy destroys the potential for coalition building.<br />
Gosine 10 (Andil, Associate Professor of Sociology at York, 4/28/2010, “Non-white Reproduction and Same-Sex Eroticism: Queer Acts against Nature”, Queer ecologies: sex, nature, politics, desire, p.155-9, MH)<br />
The denunciation of homosexuality shares much in common with the attacks on the fertility and potentially reproductive sexualities of non-white men and women. First, nature stands in for nation in both narratives, an easy epistemological substitution, as nations have the same requirements as “healthy environments”: reproductive species and resistance to the incursions of foreign bodies. As Sarah Ahmed suggests, “a good or healthy neighbourhood [or nation] does not leak outside itself, and hence does not let outsiders (or foreign agents/viruses) in” (2000, 25). There is, she adds, “no body as such that is given in the world: bodies materialize in a complex set of temporal and spatial relations to other bodies, including bodies that are recognized as familiar and friendly, and those that are considered strange” (40). In white nationalist projects, including European colonization, homosexuals and non-white reproductive heterosexuals are “strange”; they make no contribution to the building and expansion of—and in fact threaten—white nations. Their significance derives instead from their manifestations of oppositional subjects, as the Others through whom the white subject can make sense of himself (for the “normal” human subject is always a biological male), and upon whom anxieties about identity may be focused. The articulation of nature within a white, nationalist framework, furthermore, produces homosexuals and non-whites as not just strange, but toxic. Working with Ahmed’s theorization of nationalism, Berila points out that “who and what counts as toxic is . . . deeply contested ground” (2005, 130). “Since the bodies of particular others, usually people of color, queers, women, or people from other nations, are repeatedly targeted as threats to the nation,” she adds, “the reading of which bodies are marked as toxic seems particularly important in any discussion of the landscapes of nation and national identity” (130). Nationalism is always predicated on racialized heterosexuality, as the survival of nations demands the reproduction of bodies. It is for this reason that women have been regarded in nationalist discourses as objects of both reverence and slippage; they are biological reproducers of the nation, but any sexual transgressions on their part (lesbianism, interracial sex) mean that they also threaten its survival (Anthias, Yuval-Davis, and Cain 1992). The most expansive project of white nationalism, the colonization of North America, has been deeply informed by and achieved through the generation of responses to anxieties about homosexuality and the sexual liberties of non-white heterosexuals. Historian Ned Katz notes that “the widespread homosexuality of the North American Indians was given as an excuse by the invading whites for their extermination” and “the Christianization of Native Americans and the colonial appropriation of the continent by white, Western ‘civilization’ included the attempt by the conquerors to eliminate various traditional forms of<br />
Indian homosexuality—as part of their attempt to destroy that Native culture that might fuel resistance—a form of cultural genocide involving both Americans and Gay people” (quoted in Gaard 1998, 33). White homosexual subjects betrayed the nation’s reproductive imperative. The threat of non-white homosexual subjects to the nation was differently rationalized. They were problematic by virtue of their apparent potential to attract and “homo-sexualize” whites. Stoler notes that during the colonial period, “desires for opulence and sex, wealth and excess were repeatedly attributed to creole Dutch and lower-class Europeans, to those with culturally hybrid affiliations and/or of mixed-blood origin.” Natives and these “fictive” Europeans, Stoler adds, were “persons ruled by their sexual desires” (1995, 183). The “homosexual native” and the “native woman” represented temptation, and threatened to unravel the European’s self-discipline, unleashing his darkest fantasies. These anxieties laid the groundwork for the theories of racialization that would emerge in the nineteenth century, such as those posited by Count Gobineau in his “Essay on the Equality of Races.” Gobineau’s core argument was that it was the white races who are inclined to be sexually attracted toward the other races, which is why they mix with them, while yellow and brown races were deemed to have a stronger repulsion to interracial sex, which is why, he says, they tended to remain relatively unmixed (quoted in Young 1995, 107). Indeed, nineteenth-century theories of race did not just consist of essentializing differentiations between self and other but also were, as Young points out, broadly about “a fascination with people having sex—interminable, adulterating, aleatory, illicit, inter-racial sex” (181). Such racial theory, Young argues, “projected a phantasmagoria of the desiring machine [of colonialism] as a people factory.” There were great fears about uncontrollable, frenetic fornication producing the countless motley varieties of interbreeding, with the miscegenated offspring themselves then generating an ever increasing melange, “mongrelity,” of self-propagating endlessly diversifying hybrid progeny: half-blood, half-caste, half-breed, cross-breed, amalgamate, intermix, miscegenate, alvino, cabre, cafuso, castizo, cholo, chino, cob, creole, dustee, fustee, griffe, mamaluco. (181) Subsequent to the fall of European empires, these anxieties took new shape as anti-immigration discourses (“Yellow Fever,” “Asian Invasion,” etc.) and, as already noted, overpopulation propaganda. More recently, postindustrial concerns about environmental degradation have provided another prism through which xenophobia and racism could be articulated as environmental prudence. But make no mistake about it: Calls by groups such as the Sierra Club (U.S.)—some of them made as recently as 2006—to curb immigration and regulate the sexual reproduction of people in the Global South are merely a restatement of white nationalist ideals as a commitment to nature. This analysis is supported by research demonstrating North American environmentalists’ commitment to white nationalist constructions of nature. As Noël Sturgeon points out, mainstream environmentalists, in their emphasis on wilderness, species extinction, and in general seeing the environment as excluding human beings, often fall into service to this dominant Western logic of seeing the natural as pure, unchanging, untainted by social influence and without history. This kind of mainstream environmentalism avoids environmental justice issues, which deal primarily with problems of human and community health using a broader, less reified definition of the environment and identifying power relations as central to the cause of environmental problems. (2004, 263) Nature needs protection, this logic forwards, from the toxic presence of non-white bodies. Coverage of arrests of men engaged in or looking for sex in natural spaces similarly reveals nature’s parallel constitution (with nation) as a pure space that must be protected from the incursions of toxic homosexuals. One commonly employed strategy toward this effect has been to equate sex with pollution, and to focus on the litter and damage to the environment produced by homosexual acts. A news report filed by Sarah Lemagie for the Star Tribune on the Minnesota arrests provides one illustration of this approach. Lemagie begins the article by associating gay sex with garbage. “The trash-strewn pulloffs along the Minnesota River hardly look like Lovers’ Lane,” she notes, “but to Burnsville police who have been tracking lewd behavior between men there, that’s basically what they’ve become.” Writing about a popular cruising spot at Maple Grove, she quotes an officer who makes note of the damage men seeking sex inflict on the environment and litter they leave behind. “Men loitered in cars or at picnic benches and retreated in pairs to the bushes,” where officers found mattresses and “condoms by the hundreds,” she reports him as saying. In Canada, an article about male cruising in Stanley Park that appeared in the Vancouver Sun in 2001 reported, “Venture down one of the well-worn side paths into the trees and you can’t miss it. The soggy ground is carpeted with used condoms, their wrappers, and tissues, the tell-tale remnants of what is widely known in the male gay community as park sex” (Zacharias 2001, A1). A June 2007 story appearing in the National Post repeated this association of homosexual sex with pollution of natural space, and condemned police for not taking punitive action. “Visitors to one part of famous Stanley Park may stumble upon men engaged in fellatio and intercourse,” columnist Brian Hutchinson noted, “yet cruising areas, littered with used condoms and cigarette butts, seem sacrosanct” (Hutchison 2007, A1). Similarly, a report filed by Peter Baker for the Essex Chronicle focuses on the outrage expressed by Brian Olley in encountering homosexual acts taking place in Hylands Park. According to the article, park user Brian Olley “exercises his dog in Hylands by walking from his nearby home twice a day” (2006, 11). Although he had often seen “vehicles with male occupants park outside the main gate [to the Hylands]” on most evenings, he was “shocked to come across two men having sex on a path he used to walk his dog by the park’s edge” (11). Olley, Barker reports, has noticed “there is unsavoury litter around the entrance area” frequented by men looking for sex. The Hylands estate manager is also quoted as saying, “The condoms and tissues presumably get deposited on the highway and in lay-bys” (11). This littering of parks is akin to “dirtying the nation,” particularly in light of the historical constitution of parks as part of white nation-building. More recently, moral dangers about both homosexuality and non-white reproductive heterosexuality have been stated through the production of ecological discourses. In Malthusian renderings of environmentalism, the planet’s demise is linked to the immoral ravishes of the polluting underclass. Sandilands notes that population discourse “relies on the bifurcation of the world into two: ‘good’ ecological citizens, who have listened to and understood the call for limits and do not require (further) regulatory intervention, and unruly bodies, who have not, might not and/or do not” (1999, 86). Nature has similarly been used as a means of production and site of moral regulation against homosexual sex, such as in the representation of public sex as polluting. Sandilands explains, “Bulldozing the trees or pulling up the undergrowth in a downtown park can be as much a threat to the public expression of gay male culture as it is to urban nature, and polluting a beach that acts as a center for outdoor lesbian activity can destroy both biotic and social communities” (2001, 175). Sandilands concludes that mainstream environmentalism, such as that involved in the creation of urban parks, “includes a strong historical tradition of marginalizing sexual expression; in order to approach moral purity, sexuality was excluded” (Ingram, quoted in Sandilands 2001, 176). A 2005 U.S. Department of Justice guidebook entitled Illicit Sexual Activity in Public Places, produced by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, makes clear the equation of immoral with environmental transgressions insofar as homosexuality is concerned. Issued as part of a series that aims to “summarize knowledge about how police can reduce the harm caused by specific crime and disorder problems” (v)<br />

 Ceding to competitions and attempts to become the epitome of masculinity uphold heteronormativity<br />

Heterosexuality constitutes men as “real” men (Wittig, 1992). To be a “real” man is an exhausting and unending performance, or as Michael Kimmel (2001) puts it, “that nightmare from which we never seem to awaken” (p. 277). Homophobia and the fear of being perceived as gay become the central organizing principle and the cultural policing of manhood. The fear of humiliation and emasculation keeps “real”men afraid, ashamed to be afraid, and silent about their own fears (Kimmel, 2001). Fear and shame are sites of psychic violence for these men. In addition, on the level of sexual practice, MacGillivray notes, “there is harm, since I for one would suggest that heterosexuality is based on a repression of all unsanctioned sexual impulses, whichmost–if not all–of us feel” (Thomas&amp; MacGillivray, 2000, p. 257). In sum, heteronormativity impels heterosexual men into a lifelong labor of “proving” their manhood and concealing, if not banishing, a range of sexual possibilities, gender performances, and pleasures.<br />

Their impact framing pleas to dominant ideas about what is normal and what matters. Queering ecological thinking detoxifies knowledge production and offer the best political solution.<br />
DiChiro 10 (Giovanna, Research Associate at the Five College Women's Studies Research Center, 4/28/2010, “Polluted Politics? Confronting Toxic Discourse, Sex Panic, and Eco-Normativity”, Queer ecologies: sex, nature, politics, desire, p.224-5, MH)<br />
Environmental theory and politics in the United States have historically mobilized ideas of the normal, or what Rosemarie Garland-Thomson refers to as “the normate,” that is, “the social figure through which people can represent themselves as definitive human beings” (1997, 8), to determine which bodies and environments/landscapes embody the distinctly American values of productive work, rugged individualism, masculinity, independence, potency, and moral virtue, upon which environmental advocacy movements should be based (e.g., Haraway 1989; Cronon 1991). Critical histories of U.S. environmentalism have revealed the capitalist, patriarchal, colonialist, heteronormative, eugenicist, and ableist histories underlying its “progressive” exterior (e.g., Boag 2003; Darnovsky 1992; Evans 2002; Gaard 2004; Jaquette 2005; Sutter 2001). In this chapter, I have examined the residues of what I have called eco-normativity (or, eco[hetero]normativity) that appear in the alarmist discourse of the anti-toxics arm of the environmental movement, residues that, I argue, appeal to pre-existing cultural norms of gender balance, normal sexual reproduction, and the balance of nature. The deployment of the anti-normal or anti-natural in anti-toxic discourse is questionable political-ecological strategy and can work to reinforce the dominant social and economic order (the forces actually behind environmental destruction and toxic contamination of all our bodies and environments) by naturalizing the multiple injustices that shore it up. In short, this unexamined toxic discourse produces polluted politics even while claiming to stand for diversity and justice. I have also examined feminist and environmental justice challenges to normal environmentalism, which, I argue, are queering ecological thinking and creating new possibilities for genuine coalition politics with the aim of disrupting the social power of eco-normativity. The question remains: Can the environmental coalitions we develop succeed in calling for stronger environmental protections, the right to a healthy body, and the need for sustainable communities in such a way that resists appeals to normalcy and normativity? And, furthermore, can our coalitions be capacious enough to embrace and care for all community members (human and nonhuman) even in their “irrevocable difference” (Clare 2001, 361)? In closing, I return to Clare’s creative politics of articulation, in which he links queer and disability theorists’ critiques of the compulsions of heterosexuality and able-bodiedness together with the environmental justice movement’s redefining of nature and environment as “community” and “home.” While those bodies, communities, and environments that stray from the “normate” may be hated, impoverished, and poisoned, Clare maintains that seeing and knowing from non-normate positions may offer outsider views for imagining new, just, and sustainable ways of living on the earth—our home. “And as for the lies and false images, we need to name them, transform them, create something entirely new in their place, something that comes close and finally true to the bone, entering our bodies as liberation, joy fury, hope, a will to refigure the world. The body as home” (12).<br />

The call to protect the environment and ecologies resonate with historical environmentalist eugenics attempts by America against Native Americans. Violent dictatorships like Nazi Germany historically model American violent policy and create conditions for catastrophe.<br />
Hogan 10 (Katie, Professor of English and Director of Women’s Studies at Carlow University, 7/14/2010, “Undoing Nature: Coalition Building as Queer Environemtnalism”, Queer ecologies: sex, nature, politics, desire, p234-5, MH)<br />
Ordover singles out the rash of anti-gay ballot measures of the early 1990s—I will be focusing on one of these campaigns in this chapter—as contemporary examples of eugenics- like discourses of the late twentieth century. Ordover also points to scientific and medical research into the alleged “gay gene” as a medical instance of a contemporary eugenics-like project. And although Ordover does not devalue mainstream environmental movements, she nevertheless demonstrates how these movements can be cannibalized by eugenics ideas, evident in the current “greening of hate” phenomenon that has emerged in the last decade. For instance, some members of local chapters of the mainstream environmental group the Sierra Club have created alliances with anti-immigrant campaigners to oust immigrants from the United States on the grounds that they are environmental threats; the rhetoric of “protecting nature,” repeatedly evoked, resonates with a eugenics ideology (Ordover 2003, 50, also Hartman 2006). In other words, eugenics and environmentalism, while not one and the same, have been historically linked as projects that operate in tandem, rather than in opposition, and often in terms of ideas of the unfit and unnatural. Perhaps one of the most disturbing examples of nature as a platform for eugenics purposes is analyzed in Bruggemeier, Cioc, and Zeller’s volume, How the Green Were the Nazis: Nature, Environment, and Nation in the Third Reich (2005). Using the lens of environmental history to shed light on the Nazi’s manipulations of environmental preservation programs as a cover for racial genocide, the essays in this collection address annexation of lands in Eastern Europe in an effort to “Germanize” the landscape. To implement these programs German officials relocated and/or exterminated those communities deemed inferior, unfit, and insufficiently Aryan to live on German land. Although the collection does not directly analyze connections between American eugenics and Nazi environmentalism, several essays do link America’s eugenics-like programs, including the United States’ seemingly innocent program of building national parks, as an aspect of purity and nationalism campaigns that later inspired Nazi environmental policies. For instance, the Nazis took inspiration from the United States’ extermination and relocation of Native peoples from lands in order to create national parks and control natural resources. Of course, the Nazis took things further; they cleansed the unfit throughout Eastern Europe in order to purify the German landscape, but they made the link between land, nation, and unfit/unnatural by studying U.S. policies. These theoretical and historical perspectives on environmentalism serve as dramatic instances of how, in the name of nature, racial eugenics ideologies are reformulated as caring for the environment. Nature and environmentalism are categories that are uniquely susceptible to this kind of exploitation because these categories are often assumed to be benign, neutral, or innocent. Yet the disturbing links between eugenics and environmentalism in modern history suggest how “everyday eugenics” masquerades as ecological preservation.<br />

The 1AC decided in their impact framing that the groups of people who were bearing the brunt of climate change didn’t matter. This focus causes a direct tradeoff with a strategy of environmental justice which is comparatively better at preventing ecological ethnocide.<br />
Sturgeon 10 (Noel, Ph.D. in History of Consciousness, Professor of Women’s Studies at Washington State University, “ Penguin Family Values: The Nature of Planetary Environmental Reproductive Justice”, Queer ecologies: sex, nature, politics, desire, p.118-123, MH)<br />
It is interesting that in the face of this popular cultural emphasis on the negative environmental effects of climate change on animal reproduction and hence survival, there is little mention of people’s reproduction and survival; where this issue appears, it often only stresses problematic ideas about particular people’s supposed over-reproduction. Missing from the popular culture arena, for the most part, is any attention to the immediate threat to numerous groups of people especially vulnerable to climate change by reason of geography, poverty, or political discrimination. The use of a group of people as a symbol of endangered species is uncomfortable for the authors of popular culture (as it should be), partly because it calls up questions of unequal responsibility and unequal consequences that are difficult to deal with in the arena of popular culture as entertainment. Both recent global warming documentaries mentioned above, Gore’s and Brokaw’s, use images of penguins and polar bears to dramatize the consequences of melting polar ice, but neither mentions the impact of climate change on Arctic indigenous peoples, one of the groups of people already most seriously impacted by climate change. I juxtapose this story with the story of the Emperor penguins with trepidation, since indigenous people are not penguins, and endangered tribal cultures are not endangered species. Seeing indigenous people as endangered species and thus equating them with animals is dangerous because such depictions can be racist.7 Such a parallel re-enacts the questionable trope of the “disappearing Indian,” a dominant narrative that discounts and obscures the struggle of real indigenous peoples to exist and successfully transform their cultures strategically for survival. Arctic indigenous tribes may be threatened by climate change, but they are resilient and experienced in resisting threats to their people. As Chickaloon Grand Chief Gary Harrison says in Through Arctic Eyes (2005), a movie documenting the effects of climate change on Arctic indigenous people: “We’ve adapted in the past, which is why we are still here.” Yet as a story about the environmental politics of reproduction, the ways in which cultural reproduction needs to be valued as much as biological reproduction, the relation of planetary reproduction to human reproduction, and the need to comprehend human beings as embedded in environmental systems on which they are dependent, the experience of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic region needs to be more widely known.8 As many sources note, because of the rigors of survival in Arctic areas, Arctic native peoples are necessarily close to an environment that is particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change, a region tied to the global ecological system in so many intricate ways that changes in the Arctic have worldwide consequences. Rather than seeing themselves as an endangered species, vulnerable and helpless, Arctic First Nations have been politically active in publicizing the problem of global climate change and suggesting solutions for many years before other people paid attention to the issue.9 They have known that the threats they face to their culture and livelihoods are early warnings for the threats people around the world will face. Patricia Cochran, former chairperson of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, points out the worldwide implications of what Arctic First Peoples are experiencing now: “All of this will have a profound impact on the viability of indigenous cultures throughout the North, and further afield. Everything is connected in nature; what happens in Alaska will affect all other places of the world as a cascading effect, as scientists call it, will occur” (Cochran 2007). I learned something about what the indigenous Arctic peoples are facing during an event sponsored by the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., in October 2005. As part of a celebration of all things Arctic, which spotlighted its excellent collection of Arctic art and animals and publicized its support of research on the Arctic, the Smithsonian Museum organized a panel primarily of Yu’pik people on the topic of global warming and its effect on their lives and their land. Between the morning and afternoon performances of Native Arctic dancers, who drummed and sang under the watchful eye of the preserved African elephant in the main lobby, an audience gathered in the auditorium to listen to the panel, whose title was based on a indigenous description of the crisis: “The Earth Is Moving Faster Now” (Krupnik and Jolly 2002). The title referred to the fact that global climate change has had a measurable impact on the lives of these indigenous people for a number of years. Over 8 percent of the sea ice has melted, with severe consequences for marine life, caribou herds (because migration patterns are disrupted), and coastal villages (because sea ice creates a buffer for coastal settlements against large waves). Increased thunderstorms and lightning cause more forest fires. Dangerous levels of UV radiation cause increased incidence of skin cancer and damage to eyesight. Ecological stress and disruption to traditional plant and animal food sources force a turn to a diet of store-bought foods that cause diabetes (Krupnik and Jolly 2002; Mercredi 2005). On the Smithsonian panel, Cristina Alava, a Yu’pik elder and teacher, spoke about the difficulty of bringing back edible meat from long distance hunting trips if the weather continued to warm. As the permafrost melts earlier and freezes later, it becomes very difficult to transport meat over the softened tundra and to keep the large carcasses cold enough so they don’t rot before getting to the hunters’ families. Orville Huntington, an Athabascan employee of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, showed slides of the ice retreating and talked about the “silence of the moose” in the region, as their seasonal travels are disrupted by the changing climate. Huntington emphasized the depth and complexity of indigenous knowledge about the area, and the possibility of losing this knowledge along with the animals and the ice. Harry Brower Jr., a indigenous whaler, scientist, and subsistence hunter, also spoke about the ways in which subsistence living is part of cultural survival and an important method for keeping the world in balance. Other panelists echoed this theme, describing the Yu’pik understanding of the way in which the environment is part of a larger universe with moral and cultural aspects that are maintained by the practices of indigenous peoples who have lived on the land for thousands of years.<br />
One of the striking aspects of the discourse of the panelists was their insistence on speaking as knowledgeable experts based on their own cultural expertise, their beliefs and experience as indigenous people, even when they mentioned along the way that some of them had degrees in biology and wildlife management and/or worked in the fields of education and literacy. It was crucially important for them to try to get across to the audience that their knowledge arose from their way of life, which similarly was embedded in the environment, and that this interdependence of cultural identity, expert knowledge, land, and animal existence was at the brink of extermination from global warming. In contrast, the white scientists who introduced and commented on the panel consistently referred to the indigenous panelists as community members and artisans, rather than scientists and researchers, undercutting their status as experts. The point the indigenous panelists were making, however, was that the extensive knowledge they had about sustainable practices, whether it was supported by scientific expertise or traditional experience, was knowledge that arose from a particular way of life, one that needed to be respected and maintained. It was not knowledge gained from the mystical identity of being Ecological Indians, but was rather sophisticated information needed now by all those, indigenous or not, trying to understand and redress climate change. In contrast, the panelists implied, an industrialized and consumer economy’s dependencies on nonrenewable fuels, emission-producing technologies, mobility, and manufactured goods were not just unsustainable, but gave those who lived in these ways false understandings of the way material, life-sustaining practices worked. Material practices of reproduction and production have epistemological implications; that is, they affect what we know and how we know it. We are all, like the penguins, suited or not suited to particular ecological contexts, and living without respect for those contexts has consequences. Worse, from the perspective of the indigenous panelists, global capitalist industrialized ways of living and (not) knowing threaten the existing knowledge base needed to live in sustainable ways, not least because the cultural existence of indigenous people is threatened. The worst example of white condescension and willful misapprehension of the point being made by these indigenous experts was the introduction to the event by a retired white Alaskan politician. While acknowledging the likelihood that indigenous Arctic cultures are being irreversibly changed by global climate change, he referred admiringly to the idea that an ice sculpture is made more beautiful because it is transient and proudly pointed out that the state of Alaska had made computers available to tribal villages in order to allow native artisans to more effectively sell their crafts in a global economy. From his point of view, this was a sufficient way to preserve Native Alaskan culture in the face of what he clearly accepted as the inevitable “transience” of their existence and their way of life due to global climate change and the requirements of a global economy. Randel Hansen (2005) calls this situation the “ethnocide via climate change of Arctic indigenous communities.” How do we think about this situation as these processes accelerate so that, within a generation, these indigenous communities may not survive? Is this natural? What kind of environmental politics can encompass the threat to both Emperor penguins and Alaskan Natives from global climate change? The disjuncture between the politics of species preservation and the politics of environmental justice presents a barrier to thinking through the relation between these looming disasters. For instance, in An Inconvenient Truth, there is a lengthy discussion of the consequences of the melting of the northern and southern polar ice. There is no mention at all of the consequences of this drastic change on Arctic indigenous peoples. Instead, there is a wrenching depiction of an animated polar bear trying unsuccessfully to get onto a melting ice floe in a vast, iceless sea. Yet the ecologies of the polar bear and of the Arctic indigenous peoples are interrelated, and surely both are worth concern and intervention. They are also ecologies interrelated with industrialized ecologies. The reproduction of industrialized economic systems, particular by the United States and other Western countries, has consequences for planetary ecological workings on a global scale as well as on the scale of communities, families, and species, determining the ability of animals, families, and cultures to reproduce in healthy and sustainable ways. In a point relevant to my earlier discussion of the penguins, we should understand family structure in these indigenous communities as arising from interrelationships among animals, land, and economic practices. Family does not float free in nuclear groupings of two adults (heterosexual or not) and two children, independent of the consequences of their material practices, whether they are industrialized or hunter-gatherers. The idea that families either are separate from or purely reflect a romanticized or anthropomorphized nature is an illusion, whether they are Western or indigenous or any other kind of family. So the point is not that we all have to or should replicate the family structures of Arctic indigenous peoples (which are varied), but we might try, as environmentalists, feminists, and gay activists, to be cognizant of the material interrelationships produced by particular familial forms so that we can choose responsible ways of living, producing, consuming, and reproducing on our planet. Romanticizing indigenous people, or ignoring the technological and ecological underpinnings of all ways of living, are different forms of racism, both of which can make ecological ethnocide invisible.<br />

 The epistemology behind space resource exploitation depends on heteronomrative ways of viewing the world<br />
Griffin 9 (Penny, Senior Lecturer - Convenor, MA International Relations, ‘The Spaces Between Us: The Gendered Politics of Outer Space’, in Bormann, N. and Sheehan, M. (eds), Securing Outer Space. London and New York: Routledge, p.69-70, MH)<br />
Similarly, NASA’s website claims that ‘from the time of our birth, humans have felt a primordial urge to explore’, to ‘blaze new trails, map new lands, and answer profound questions about ourselves and our universe’ (www.nasa.gov). Much commercial gain already depends on the exploitation of outer space, but there is undoubtedly more to be made of space’s ‘resources’: ‘asteroidal’ mining, for example; the extraction of ‘lunar soil oxygen’; the mining of very rare ‘Helium-3’ from lunar soil as fuel for nuclear fusion reactors; or space, and particularly the Moon, as a ‘tourist venue’, offering all kinds of new ‘sporting opportunities’ (Morabito 2005:5–7). But the lines distinguishing the various components of the outer space ‘whole’ are vague, and are particularly obscured by the tacit but pervasive heteronormativity that makes of space (to borrow the language of the then USSPACECOM) a ‘medium’ to be exploited; the passive receptacle of US terrestrial ‘force’. As Goh states, outer space ‘is an arena of growing economic and technological importance. It is also a developing theatre of military defence and warfare’ (2004:259). US outer space discourse is driven by the belief that outer space exists to be conquered (and that it rarely fights back), that those at the cutting edge of its exploitation are the ‘visionaries’ and ‘entrepreneurs’ that will pave the way to tourists, explorers, TV crews and to, as Morabito claims, ‘dubious characters’ such as, perhaps, ‘bounty hunters’ (2004:10).<br />

By framing war in terms of gender both pro-war and anti-war continuously re-assert old and easily understood cultural meanings of gender. While anti-war actors agree that war debate is about masculinity, they must actively contest the masculinity mobilized by pro-war actors to make the case for war. Anti-war actors contest the cowboy masculinity valued by those who are pro-war in favor a masculinity that values diplomacy and international relationships. According to anti-war actors, cowboy masculinity and its simplistic language and “go it alone” approach to foreign policy has serious consequences as it devalues discussion and dissent. Anti-war actors value a kind of masculinity that is about forming relationships through diplomacy instead of rushing into war as unilateral action. There are serious consequences for using lone ranger cowboy masculinity to frame war debate. When the pro-war position values a “lone ranger,” “go it alone” kind of cowboy masculinity they are actively devalue diplomacy, and debate, at the cost of international relationships and international organizations. Mobilizing cowboy masculinity thus has consequences for international peace and diplomacy as cowboy devalues complex discussion, international cooperation, and organizations such as the United Nations. Pro-war actors are primarily responsible for framing war debate around macho, cowboy masculinity in order to construct the case for war. Anti-war actors only work within the frame of masculinity given by pro-war actors when they contest the pro-war argument. As a result, anti- war actors rarely engage in active framing of war, and thus do not have the opportunity to construct a complex anti-war argument. By continuing to construct war debate war within the constraining frame of gender, anti-war actors not challenge the dismissal of “feminine” perspectives from war debate as voices that are not the correct kind of masculinity (such as the perspective of women) are silenced. Framing war debate in terms of better or worse forms of masculinity simplifies debate, as those who are anti-war are only able to construct opposing perspectives that require different conceptions of masculinity instead of transgressing gender altogether. Furthermore, constructing international actors and states as male individuals justifies organizing war debate around conceptions of masculinity as male international actors must express a specific kind of masculinity or feel threatened otherwise.<br />

 The notion that threats are real is simply a fantasy produced by the neurotic drive for global mastery- even if they were true, voting affirmative wouldn’t solve them<br />
James B Rule, PhD Harvard, MA Oxford, BA Brandeis, The Military State of America and the Democratic Left, Dissent Vol. 57 No 1, Winter 2010<br />
So what can the democratic Left offer as an alternative to the endless agenda of American world domination? We could well begin with an extremely modest proposal: retooling the United States as a normal country. Normal, that is to say, by comparison to other prosperous democratic societies. Just to get the ball rolling, consider reducing the proportion of American GDP devoted to military purposes by half - to roughly three hundred billion dollars per year, or about 10 percent of the national budget. Included in this reduction should be all unacknowledged expenditures for services of mercenaries and other off-the-books manifestations of U.S. militarism. This would still leave the United States as one of the most heavily militarized countries in the world. But it would also make vast resources available for more constructive purposes, ranging from universal medical coverage for Americans to investment in renewable energy to support of global initiatives to control of curable diseases in the world's poorest countries. The outrage at any such suggestion is predictable. What about the evils, dangers and conspiracies that constantly threaten this country? We've got Muslim fundamentalism, a resurgent China, failed states, nuclear proliferation ... We've got, we've got ... !slamo -fascismi The United States leads the world against these enemies of civilization. You're proposing abandonment of our allies, disengagement from the rest of the world - indeed, isolationism! One thinks of the desperate rationalizations of a morbidly obese person contemplating gentle suggestions for a diet: &quot;Don't make me do it! I might wither away and die of starvation!&quot; This modest proposal in no way requires categorical disengagement from global concerns. Under it, America would remain a major military power. It would allow ample resources to counteract violent threats to American wellbeing, both foreign and domestic. But halving our military budget would encourage longoverdue national debate about the wisest uses of this country's substantial remaining military resources. Most important, a lurch toward normalcountry status would make it easier for America and Americans to support one of the most significant recent trends in global affairs. These are the subtle shifts toward attenuation of exclusive prerogatives of states in general - in favor of other forms of global authority. Signs of these changes include efforts to create international authority over war crimes; the willingness of national courts to indict and prosecute highly placed human rights violators in other countries, notwithstanding claims of sovereign immunity; and the rising role of NGOs and other grassroots actors in challenging human rights violations and other atrocities. Very incrementally, states are losing their unchallenged monopoly to exert large-scale coercion. Neoconservatives will of course deride such tentative developments as insignificant in juxtaposition to the fixed and eternal (as they see them) forces of realpolitik. But in fact, these trends could hold the keys to curtailing the vast toll of state-sponsored violence that reached its climax - at least, we hope - in the twentieth century. We on the democratic left should be first to support such changes. Hegemony advantage makes the perm impossible- this card will end them Above all, America has to get over the fantastical fixation on its status as the world's master military enforcer, both the obsession with maintaining that status and the frightening conviction of moral superiority that seems to go along with it. Most dangerous of all is the view of America as some sort of avenging angel of global righteousness, such that American failure to rain down military destruction on retrograde regimes becomes tantamount to supporting them. Such logic can never be applied systematically. There are just too many unappealing regimes and movements around the world for them all to be targeted. But the availability of that idea in the language of American politics enables whoever holds sway in Washington to demonize any regime that gets in America's way as the Evil du jour, hence a legitimate target for made-in-America mayhem. And it appears, alas, that there will always be intellectuals ready to supply high-minded rationales for such efforts. Such justifications must never come from the democratic Left.<br />

 Their framework is heteronormative. Only our interpretation allows communications fields to become an important educational opportunity to unpack the heterosexual knapsack and shift knowledge production away from heterosexual norms.<br />

In other words, communication scholars are inextricably involved in current regimes of power and knowledge. As such, communication scholars are profoundly implicated in the maintenance of the homo/heterosexual binary, the fundamental conceptual pair that organizes modern Western discourses of sexuality. In the academy and elsewhere, institutional heterosexuality, through the process of normalization, becomes heteronormative. Heteronormativity produces “the equation ‘heterosexual experience = human experience’” and “renders all other forms of human sexual expression pathological, deviant, invisible, unintelligible, or written out of existence” (Yep, 2002, p. 167). More simply put, heteronormativity is violent and harmful to a range of people across the spectrum of sexualities, including those who live within its borders. Aware of the mobility of power relations, queer/quare theorists from a variety of disciplines have provided analytical tools to create new openings and possibilities of change and transformation. Such scholars are not interested in speaking for others, providing definitive solutions, proclaiming transhistorical generalizations, declaring transcultural knowledge, or making universal pronouncements. These queer/quare theorists and activists are invested in “detaching the power of truth from the forms of hegemony, social, economic and cultural, within which it operates at the present time” (Foucault, 1980, p. 133). Committed to the celebration of human differences and dedicated to the interrogation of the normalizing technologies of power, these interdisciplinary scholars and community activists scrutinize the homo/heterosexual binary as the foundation of current discourses of sexuality, and critically examine heteronormativity. As a communication teacher and scholar who travels across academic disciplinary boundaries, I invite communication scholars across the spectrum of social locations to join these theorists and practitioners in this radical project to expand, stretch, reorient, and re-map the conceptual landscape of the field of communication. I urge communication teachers and scholars to interrogate and unpack the homo/heterosexual binary, disentangle and demystify the power of heteronormativity in our scholarship, pedagogy, and cultural politics, and to create and produce historically specific and embodied racialized knowledges of the human sexual subject.<br />

Queer criticism, then, both draws attention to and challenges the notion that sexuality is a private matter that is best left in the bedroom. For queer critics, when people suggest that it is inappropriate to discuss issues of sexuality, they are really saying that nonnormative sexualities are inappropriate. The dogmatic insistence upon silence when it comes to queer sexualities does not, in practice, apply to those with normative sexualities. Queer critics draw attention to the fact that heterosexuality is frequently displayed publicly. Such displays include the fact that heterosexuals are able to walk down the street holding hands, or sit in the park kissing. It is not unusual to see heterosexuals have photographs of their husbands or wives and children on their desks in the workplace. Marriage is another example of the celebration of normative sexuality– engagements and marriages are typically announced in the newspaper. When queers try to celebrate their relationships in similar ways, they are, at best, accused of making something public that people don’t want to hear about or, at worst, they are accused of trying to destroy the most fundamental institution upon which society is built (the nuclear family). Queer critics draw attention to the hypocrisy of such a double standard, and they emphasize that if people were secure in their own sexual roles they would have no reason to feel threatened by sexualities that differ from their own.<br />

In fact, normative legal thought is so much in a hurry that it will tell you what to do even though there is not the slightest chance that you might actually be in a position to do it. For instance, when was the last time you were in a position to put the difference principle n31 into effect, or to restructure [*179] the doctrinal corpus of the first amendment? &quot;In the future, we should. . . .&quot; When was the last time you were in a position to rule whether judges should become pragmatists, efficiency purveyors, civic republicans, or Hercules surrogates? Normative legal thought doesn't seem overly concerned with such worldly questions about the character and the effectiveness of its own discourse. It just goes along and proposes, recommends, prescribes, solves, and resolves. Yet despite its obvious desire to have worldly effects, worldly consequences, normative legal thought remains seemingly unconcerned that for all practical purposes, its only consumers are legal academics and perhaps a few law students -- persons who are virtually never in a position to put any of its wonderful normative advice into effect.<br />

 Violence is a social construction—The epistemology of inevitability and rationality makes violence preferable and makes every action “justifiable”<br />
Burke, 06 (Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence and Reason 10:2 | © 2007 Anthony Burke War as a Way of Being: Lebanon 2006 (PhD, Anthony Burke was appointed to UNSW@ADFA in February 2008, after three years in the School of Social Sciences and International Studies at UNSW Sydney (2005-7) Theory &amp; Event, Project Muse).<br />
I was motivated to begin the larger project from which this essay derives by a number of concerns. I felt that the available critical, interpretive or performative languages of war -- realist and liberal international relations theories, just war theories, and various Clausewitzian derivations of strategy -- failed us, because they either perform or refuse to place under suspicion the underlying political ontologies that I have sought to unmask and question here. Many realists have quite nuanced and critical attitudes to the use of force, but ultimately affirm strategic thought and remain embedded within the existential framework of the nation-state. Both liberal internationalist and just war doctrines seek mainly to improve the accountability of decision-making in security affairs and to limit some of the worst moral enormities of war, but (apart from the more radical versions of cosmopolitanism) they fail to question the ontological claims of political community or strategic theory. In the case of a theorist like Jean Bethke Elshtain, just war doctrine is in fact allied to a softer, liberalised form of the Hegelian-Schmittian ontology. She dismisses Kant's Perpetual Peace as 'a fantasy of at-oneness...a world in which differences have all been rubbed off' and in which 'politics, which is the way human beings have devised for dealing with their differences, gets eliminated.'83 She remains a committed liberal democrat and espouses a moral community that stretches beyond the nation-state, which strongly contrasts with Schmitt's hostility to liberalism and his claustrophobic distinction between friend and enemy. However her image of politics -- which at its limits, she implies, requires the resort to war as the only existentially satisfying way of resolving deep-seated conflicts -- reflects much of Schmitt's idea of the political and Hegel's ontology of a fundamentally alienated world of nation-states, in which war is a performance of being. She categorically states that any effort to dismantle security dilemmas 'also requires the dismantling of human beings as we know them'.84 Whilst this would not be true of all just war advocates, I suspect that even as they are so concerned with the ought, moral theories of violence grant too much unquestioned power to the is. The problem here lies with the confidence in being -- of 'human beings as we know them' -- which ultimately fails to escape a Schmittian<br />
architecture and thus eternally exacerbates (indeed reifies) antagonisms. Yet we know from the work of Deleuze and especially William Connolly that exchanging an ontology of being for one of becoming, where the boundaries and nature of the self contain new possibilities through agonistic relation to others, provides a less destructive and violent way of acknowledging and dealing with conflict and difference.85 My argument here, whilst normatively sympathetic to Kant's moral demand for the eventual abolition of war, militates against excessive optimism.86 Even as I am arguing that war is not an enduring historical or anthropological feature, or a neutral and rational instrument of policy -- that it is rather the product of hegemonic forms of knowledge about political action and community -- my analysis does suggest some sobering conclusions about its power as an idea and formation. Neither the progressive flow of history nor the pacific tendencies of an international society of republican states will save us. The violent ontologies I have described here in fact dominate the conceptual and policy frameworks of modern republican states and have come, against everything Kant hoped for, to stand in for progress, modernity and reason. Indeed what Heidegger argues, I think with some credibility, is that the enframing world view has come to stand in for being itself. Enframing, argues Heidegger, 'does not simply endanger man in his relationship to himself and to everything that is...it drives out every other possibility of revealing...the rule of Enframing threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to him to enter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth.'87What I take from Heidegger's argument -- one that I have sought to extend by analysing the militaristic power of modern ontologies of political existence and security -- is a view that the challenge is posed not merely by a few varieties of weapon, government, technology or policy, but by an overarching system of thinking and understanding that lays claim to our entire space of truth and existence. Many of the most destructive features of contemporary modernity -- militarism, repression, coercive diplomacy, covert intervention, geopolitics, economic exploitation and ecological destruction -- derive not merely from particular choices by policymakers based on their particular interests, but from calculative, 'empirical' discourses of scientific and political truth rooted in powerful enlightenment images of being. Confined within such an epistemological and cultural universe, policymakers' choices become necessities, their actions become inevitabilities, and humans suffer and die. Viewed in this light, 'rationality' is the name we give the chain of reasoning which builds one structure of truth on another until a course of action, however violent or dangerous, becomes preordained through that reasoning's very operation and existence. It creates both discursive constraints -- available choices may simply not be seen as credible or legitimate -- and material constraints that derive from the mutually reinforcing cascade of discourses and events which then preordain militarism and violence as necessary policy responses, however ineffective, dysfunctional or chaotic.<br />

 Owen likes our alt—only becoming a specific intellectual, using your decision to mark the crude points of the 1AC’s discourse can make debate a space to challenge regimes of truth and power<br />

The ‘universal’ intellectual, on Foucault’s account, is that figure who maintains a commitment to critique as a legislative activity in which the pivotal positing of universal norms (or universal procedures for generating norms) grounds politics in the ‘truth’ of our being (e.g. our ‘real’ interests). The problematic form of this type of intellectual practice is a central concern of Foucault’s critique of humanist politics in so far as humanism simultaneously asserts and undermines autonomy. If, however, this is the case, what alternative conceptions of the role of the intellectual and the activity of critique can Foucault present to us? Foucault’s elaboration of the specific intellectual provides the beginnings of an answer to this question: I dream of the intellectual who destroys evidence and generalities, the one who, in the inertias and constraints of the present time, locates and marks the weak points, the openings, the lines of force, who is incessantly on the move, doesn’t know exactly where he is heading nor what he will think tomorrow, for he is too attentive to the present (PPC p. 124) The historicity of thought, the impossibility of locating an Archimedean point outside time, leads Foucault to locate intellectual activity as an ongoing attentiveness to the present in terms of what is singular and arbitrary in what we take to be universal and necessary. Following from this, the intellectual does not seek to offer grand theories but specific analyses, not global but local criticism. We should be clear on the latter point for it is necessary to acknowledge that Foucault’s position does entail the impossibility of ‘acceding to a point of view that could give us access to any complete and definitive knowledge of what may constitute our historical limits’ and, consequently, ‘we are always in the position of bargaining again’ (FR p. 47). The upshot of this recognition of the partial character of criticism is not, however, to produce an ethos of fatal resignation but, in so far as it involves a recognition that everything is dangerous, a ‘hyper and pessimistic activism’ (FR p. 343). In other words, it is the very historicity and particularity of criticism which bestows on the activity of critique its dignity and urgency. What of this activity then? We can sketch the Foucault account of the activity of critique by coming to grips with the opposition he draws between ideal critique and real transformation. Foucault suggests that the activity of critique is not a matter of saying that things are not right as they are but rather of pointing out on what kinds of assumptions, what kinds of familiar, unchallenged, uncontested modes of thought the practices we accept rest (PPC p.154) The genealogical thrust of this critical activity is ‘to show that things are not as self-evident as one believed, to see that what is accepted as self-evident is no longer accepted as such’ for ‘as soon as one can no longer think things as one formerly thought them, transformation becomes both very urgent, very difficult, and quite possible’ (PPC p. 155). The urgency of transformation derives from the contestation of thought (and the social practices in which it is embedded) as the form of our autonomy, although this urgency is given its specific character for modern culture by the recognition that the humanist grammar of this thought ties us into the technical matrix of biopolitics. The specificity of intellectual practice and this account of the activity of critique come together in the refusal to legislate a universal determination of ‘what is right’ in favour of the perpetual problematization of the present. It is not a question, for Foucault, of invoking a determination of who we are as a basis for critique but of locating what we are now as the basis for reposing the question ‘who are we?’ The role of the intellectual is thus not to speak on behalf of others (the dispossessed, the downtrodden) but to create the space within which others can speak for themselves. The question remains, however, as to the capacity of Foucault’s work to perform this crucial activity through an entrenchment of the ethics of creativity as the structures of recognition through which we recognize our autonomy in the contestation of determinations of who we are.<br />

 The alternative is to reframe what environmental impacts matter. Problems like destruction of queer bodies and cultures through toxic discourses are on an equal environmental plane as global warming, and yet these problems gain no notoriety. Only this process can unlock powerful coalition building potential.<br />
Hogan 10 (Katie, Professor of English and Director of Women’s Studies at Carlow University, 7/14/2010, “Undoing Nature: Coalition Building as Queer Environemtnalism”, Queer ecologies: sex, nature, politics, desire, p235-6, MH)<br />
Queer critical interventions into such uses of nature and environment expose the dark purpose to which nature and environmentalism can be put. Disrupting, challenging, and understanding normative ideas of what counts as naturally fit and unfit is the primary emphasis. Such critical work is as important to humans and all nature as is the work of identifying environmental racism and stopping toxic dumping on poor rurual and urban areas. Furthermore, while typical instances of environmental degradation include a focus on chemical toxicities and vulnerable ecosystems, the destruction of queer bodies, communities, and cultures through toxic discourses of unnatural and unfit are also outrageous instances of environmental destruction as urgent as disappearing species and global warming. This powerful reframing of what “counts” as environmental damage—and seeing the environmental discourse as a potential location of harm and damage—opens up affinities between ecocentrism and queer theory, but also between more directly activist approaches of environmental justice theory and activism and queer intellectual activity and thought. Since both queer and environmental justice perspectives assume that nature and environment are not neutral ahistorical categories, and each critical practice looks at how the very language of nature and environmentalism can often mask harm to humans and nature, this shared theoretical and historical experience could serve as the basis for coalition. If divided and disparate groups agreed to consider how nature is often a “weapon of oppression” used against them, and, equally important, if these same groups saw how nature is also an opportunity or creative resistance, an unusually strong coalition could be formed (Quigley 1999, 202). Like environmental justice, queer critical consciousness continually exposes the violence and ideology of these taken-for-granted terms. In this way, queer theory’s preoccupation with the uses of nature operates as a form of environmentalism that is useful to all communities deemed unfit.<br />

In light of this situation, Muñoz offers the notion of disindentifications as a lens to interpret minoritarian politics based on interlocking components of race, class, gender, and sexuality and discusses how such components affect the social. Focusing on a critique of stable conceptions of identity and committed to racialized and class knowledges, Johnson (2001) introduces quare theory. He explains, Quare studies . . . would not only critique the concept of “race” as historically contingent and socially and culturally constructed/performed, it would also address the material effects of race in a white supremacist society. . . . As a “theory of the flesh” quare necessarily engenders a kind of identity politics, one that acknowledges difference within and between particular groups. Thus, identity politics does not necessarily mean the reduction of multiple identities into a monolithic identity or narrow cultural nationalism. Rather, quare studies moves beyond simply theorizing subjectivity and agency as discursively mediated to theorizing how that mediation may propel material bodies into action. (p. 9) Both disindentifications and quare theory appear productive points of engagement with mainstream queer theory about racialized knowledges and experiences. (For a more detailed explanation of these approaches, see Johnson [2001] and Muñoz [1999].)<br />

Before its premiere, he discussed the earth's most pressing concerns in an email interview with The Canadian Press from Cambridge, England, declaring space exploration to be humankind's most urgent mission. &quot;</span><u>We are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history</u><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">,&quot; said Hawking, who has Lou Gehrig's disease, leaving him almost completely paralyzed and unable to speak. </span><u>&quot;<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Our population and</span> our use of the <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">finite resources</span> of planet Earth are <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">growing exponentially, along with our technical ability to change the environment</span> for good or ill. But our <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">genetic code still carries the selfish</span> and aggressive <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">instincts</span> that were of survival advantage in the past. <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years</span>, let alone the next thousand or million. &quot;<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Our only chance</span> of long-term survival <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">is</span> not to remain lurking on planet Earth, but <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">to spread </span>out <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">into space</span>.&quot;</u> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Hawking said this is why he favours manned — or as he puts it, &quot;personed&quot; — space flight and encourages further study into how to make space colonization possible.</span>now looks like this:</span><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; height: 1px; left: -40px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: -25px; width: 1px;"> Once we get beyond low Earth orbit, we might also figure out how to travel epic distances using something other than chemical rockets. Last November, Popular Science profiled Franklin Chang Díaz, a former NASA astronaut who is developing a rocket powered by an onboard ion engine, which, he estimates, could cut travel time to Mars from six months to a little more than one. A Japanese probe propelled by a 46-foot-wide solar sail, composed of aluminized plastic 0.0075 millimeters thick and pushed along by the pressure of the sun’s photons, flew past Venus in December. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency says the probe is now circling the sun and will return to enter Venus’s orbit in another five years. If we’re able to devise some form of fusion drive, many believe we might be able to fuel it with helium-3 mined from the moon or other celestial bodies. And NASA’s Institute for Advanced Concepts is funding a study to see whether spaceships might be able to hitch a ride with one of the 40 asteroids that periodically pass by both our planet and Mars, the ship traveling energy-free as it reaches its destination in six to 10 months.</span>
