Tom Bogdan doesn't strike you as the nervous type but there is one thing...who predicted the existence of the solar wind before it was discovered.

**Existing satellites will be overwhelmed during the storm**
**Brooks 9** (Michael, PhD in quantum physics, Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe, March 23)

By far the most important indicator of incoming space weather isNASA's Advanced Composition Explorer...Hapgood says. "We will largely lose the early warning capability."

Pursuing this theme, several participants commented on a perceived fragility...plan for sustaining solar wind measurements from an L1-based spacecraft.

**We control the direction of every impact – if we aren’t ready when the storm hits, catastrophe is inevitable**
**Brooks 9** (Michael, PhD in quantum physics, Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe, March 23)

Over the last few decades, western civilisations have busily sown the seeds of their own destruction...the clock is ticking for America.

**It hits globally and escalates**
**Brooks 9** (Michael, PhD in quantum physics, Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe, March 23)

Such nightmare scenarios are not restricted to North America...our early warning system is becoming more unreliable by the day

**No chance for recovery – a solar storm would cause permanent damage to the grid**
**Brooks 9** (Michael, PhD in quantum physics, Space storm alert: 90 seconds from catastrophe, March 23)

The truly shocking finding is that this whole...4-10 years to recover.
