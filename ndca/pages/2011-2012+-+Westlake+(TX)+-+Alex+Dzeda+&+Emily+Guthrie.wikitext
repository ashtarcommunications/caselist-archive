Email me (Alex) at [[mailto:highlandparkchap@gmail.com|highlandparkchap@gmail.com]] for anything I haven't put up yet or for full text / if you want a card I'll send it to you. Also if you need a .pdf, I store a copy of everything I cut on my laptop, so I can send it to ya.
Don't hit on Emily for cites, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">she's already dating Faraz</span>. This means you Josh Nabors. (Never mind, go ahead.)


To St Marx tab room: If something is blank, that means we haven't read it yet. Some of the links are satirical in intent, hence why counterplans and disads don't have a section, although we intend to break stuff in each category eventually.
