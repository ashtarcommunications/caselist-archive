Harris

As long as the US asserted that Afghanistan ... for Afghans and good for the world.

**Contention 2 is Afghanistan-Iran Relations-**

**4. Withdrawal of US COIN spurs improved Iran-Afghanistan relations – This solves the Afghan Heroin Trade, stabilizes the Afghan Government, and promotes Middle Eastern regionalism – Obama, Clinton, Karzai, and Iran are in agreement – Their nuclear war turns don’t apply – Plan solves relations perminantly.**

==Japan 1AC - USC== 

**PLAN: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence in Japan.**

**Advantage 1 is China**

**China’s rise is inevitable – US forward deployment necessitates Chinese military modernize its military to maintain regional dominance – withdrawal allows regional players to check China and decreases the likelihood of US-Sino conflict**
**Bandow 09** (1/12/09, Doug, Fellow at the American Conservative Defense Alliance and Cato Institute and former Special Assistant to Reagan, “First Among Equals,” HYPERLINK "[[http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=20570]]"[[http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=20570]])

It is unrealistic, given … regional peace and prosperity.

**Military modernization collapses the CCP due to friction with the PLA – makes China militarist and adventurist**
**Krawitz 3** (Howard M., Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs @ U.S. Department of State, “Modernizing China's military: a high-stakes gamble?”, Strategic Forum, December 2003, [[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QZY/is_203-204/ai_n13803180/pg_11/?tag=content;col1]]) JPG

As The Epoch Times’ Nine … gamble with their lives.

SINCE SEPTEMBER II, THE WORST-case scenarios … but as responsible soldiers.

**East Asian instability leads to nuclear war**
**Landy 2k** [Jonathon, National Security and International Correspondent, Knight Ridder, March 10, p. Lexis]
Few if any experts think China … shaky international nonproliferation regime.

**East Asia is the most likely area for conflict – multiple flashpoints, territorial disputes and lack of security cooperation**
**Dibb 1** (Paul Dibb is a Professor at the Australian National University, “Strategic Trends: Asia at a Crossroads, Naval War College Review”, Winter/01, HYPERLINK "[[http://www.nwc.navy.mil/press/Review/2001/Winter/art2-w01.htm%29]]"[[http://www.nwc.navy.mil/press/Review/2001/Winter/art2-w01.htm]])

Thus, the issue of fairness to … justice -- after 65 long years.

**Scenario 2 is Myanmar**

**An independent Japan is key to poverty reduction and stability in developing nations – specifically democratization of Myanmar**
**Koimuzi 2** (Junichiro, former prime minister of Japan, Speech given @ Singapore, 1/14/2, [[http://www.aseansec.org/5801.htm]]) JPG

Prevent Myanmar from breaking … theatre, one might add.

**Nuclear world war 3**
**Dyer ‘5** (Gwynne, Independent Journalist, St. John’s Telegram, “India and China: avoiding the past”, 4-17, L/N)
It wasn't the sort of statement … confrontation, not towards it.

**Advantage 2 is Kan (this is missing one card, it'll be up asap)**

**The plan allows Kan to focus on economic reforms and increases DPJ credibility**
**Kyodo News 6/25** (Japan Times Online, 6/25/10, [[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100625a1.html]]) JPG
