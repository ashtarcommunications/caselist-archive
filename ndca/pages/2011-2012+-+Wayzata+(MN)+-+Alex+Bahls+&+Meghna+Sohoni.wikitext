===1AC- Lakeville (with Oliver)=== 
We ask you to affirm the idea that the United States should substantially increase its exploration of space beyond the earth’s mesosphere. But we should be clear about //how// we are asking you to affirm this proposition: we are not asking you to debate this idea. We believe that exploration is an intrinsic good, and the call to explore inheres on all agents in every context. To be curious, to allow the universe to make a call on you, and to respond to that call with a joyous affirmation is the heart of what it means to be truly human. No knowledge, no action, no way of being in the world worth the name can emerge without heeding the imperative to explore. The central thesis of our claim is mirrors the Socratic imperative: the unexplored life is not worth living. Thus, we would like to claim, joining us in our call to explore is a precondition to any statement of fact, value, or action having any meaning whatsoever.

Thus instead of debating us, we ask you to join us in affirming at least one of three senses of exploration.

a) To explore is //to be open to//, or //to stand in wonder of//. The etymological root of the concept of exploration implies that to explore is also to investigate or examine. True investigation or true examination implies that one is not in a position of knowledge, and further, that one ought to admit that one does not know at the outset. Thus, the position of the explorer requires that we might be surprised by what we find when we open ourselves to the world. To debate, on the other hand, is to frame an argument to something, to say “no” to a proposition, to render a proposition a strategic pawn, and in doing so to foreclose the possibility of wonder. This foreclosure of wonder is at the root of all violence, because it decides in advance on the value of things and propositions without asking what they are in their essence. Thus we ask you to affirm that exploration, the idea that an open posture of wonder toward the world is a worthwhile mode of engaging difference.
b) To explore is to speak out of your normal place. The Latin root, explorare, combines two words. “//Plorare”// means to speak or cry out from a given place. “//Ex//” means outside of. When we invite you to explore, we are asking you to speak outside of your given or customary space or place. Thus, our call to explore is a call to rupture the space of debate, a space that we have become so accustomed to that it virtually enslaves our thought to invent new modes of speaking. Our contention is that despite our pretensions to the contrary, debate mirrors the larger breakdowns in our political and ethical processes, and that all the stalemates we can point to in public life are intrinsically related to the urge to debate and spin everything to our advantage, to render public goods the site of strategic and self interested games. The capacity that this act of rupture invites is a precondition to breaking out of the stalemates that mark our common public discourse by creating new modes of creative engagement.
c) To explore is to give up the urge to always clash. When you inevitably say “vote negative” what this call means is that there are certain modes of exploration that you will not entertain, or that you will rednder with provisional caveats. The latin term “explorare” is derived from an older word “pleure” meaning “to let flow.” To explore is to let flow without insisting on the imperative to clash or to make propositions or actions compete. Thus, we ask you to join in a joyous affirmation of what makes life valuable by letting ideas and concepts flow without presuming that they are necessarily antithetical.

In other words, we are asking you to lay down your arms and to give up the impulse to relentlessly reduce everything to debate. At least, we are asking you to affirm the idea that exploring this possibility is a good idea. While debate requires you take up a position and pose it against other positions, with the goal of closing off, judging, or deciding on the merits of a proposition. To explore, on the other hand, asks nothing more than openness, unbounded expression, and affirmation—three practices that taken together solve every impulse toward domination and destruction. Thus, even if a specific act of exploration would be damaging in the world of consequential empirical outcomes, we ask that you focus on the politics of calling for exploration, and the benefits that we would all see were you to choose to join us in this call.


Rather than focusing on the minutae of traditional debate practice, we are asking you to affirm one of two related propositions: we are asking you to literally affirm the idea that exploration of is an intrinsically good enterprise that makes humans what they are, and we are asking you to affirm the local political consequences of affirming a metaphorical reach beyond our horizons in the name of openness—to us it is self evidently true that exploration is a mode of engaging the universe that opens us to new possibilities and new horizons. Thus we are not only topical, but perhaps the only sincere topical advocacy; the resolution is something that should be held __beyond__ debate. This does not mean that voting affirmative engages in a simulation of going to space, but rather means that every agent should heed the call to explore at every opportunity because it is what makes us human. Thus we ask you to answer the call to go beyond our horizons. If you do decide to debate this, we should warn you that there are four significant implications for your choice to literally and metaphorically foreclose exploration.

**First,** choosing to debate the self evidently true proposition that we should explore beyond the bounds of the earth creates a culture of anthropocentrism and geocentric chauvanism. When we see the earth as the shining gem of the universe, and when do not think beyond it in the name of human political and economic interests, we both ignore what is unique about the earth and simultaneously we presume that the universe beyond the earth does not demand our attention.

A) We ignore what is unique about the earth. The vast majority of the astronauts who returned from space argued that the perspective that a view from space provided them made them appreciate that the earth was a smaller part of a larger cosmos, one that was fragile and valuable because of the unique set of conditions that enabled life there. This realization led them to see the earth as deserving of care as opposed to something disposable. The images of the earth that they brought back from space became an important rallying point for new environmental movements. To go beyond the mesosphere is to reflect on the fragility and beauty of the earth in ways that motivate us to protect it.

At the same time…

B) We miss out on an important opportunity to see our place in the cosmos. One of the other realizations that space travel afford us is that the earth effects and is effected by the larger cosmos. The ability to go beyond our horizons teaches us that everything in the cosmos is the result of a set of interconnected relationships. As a result, going beyond the earth induces ethical openness, because as we explore more, we realize that there is a universe outside of our narrow confines, and thus we become less arrogant about the primacy of the human in the universe. As a result, travel to space induces a humility that causes us to treat the whole cosmos, inclusive of other humans, as deserving of respect and care.

**Second,** the problem of sophistry: if you decide to debate us on this as opposed to agreeing to explore, you have at least implicitly agreed that every proposition is up for debate. What this means is that you have nothing that you really believe in as a point of orientation, instead, you will say virtually whatever you need to win a debate. We think that the idea that you would deny the scientific, moral and epistemological benefits of exploration to win a high school debate is the best proof that debate creates a dangerous lack of moral and political commitment. Debate as currently constituted cultivates an approach to argument that sacrifices ethical commitments for the sake of strategy. You can’t talk about modern debate without the pedantic invocation of the notion of “switching sides”---the idea that for every argument, there is an equally useful and strategic counter-argument. This trains us as debaters and as citizens to ALWAYS see the other side, and in the process, we lose any sense of conviction and attachment to what is ethical.

This celebration of strategy at the expense of morality __plagues__ contemporary politics---a long list of atrocities and human rights violations were __pushed__ upon people by political debate wizards like Karl Rove who __knew how to advocate anything__ but had no moral attachments that told them __what__ to advocate. This moral apathy inculcated by a strategic approach to argument has rendered the American polity __docile__ and unable to agree upon a strategy for contesting the worst forms of institutional aggression. The invasion of Iraq, the detention of combatants at Gitmo, the ongoing genocide in Darfur, and ultimately our want to know our place in the universe by exlopring it are all symptomatic of the same underlying problem; that our relationships to the universe areare defined purely __strategically__ and that arguments can never explore the ground beyond the stifling prison of switching-sides. Agreeing with us constitutes a refusal that arguments are always contestable and consequently withdraws our consent from the cycle of switch-side debate. Rejecting the urge to debate the resolution recognizes that arguments about the drive to know more, to see our situation from a different viewpoint, or to reap the environmental and social benefits of space exploration are more than just a tool that enhances the uniqueness to our case but instead represents something that demands the most genuine ethical demand upon us as intellectuals and as human beings.


**Third,** policy debate as currently conceived deifies experts. You can’t hear a defense of or rejection of the imperative to explore without excessive reliance upon so-called expert opinion. In fact, the truth is that for all the hours of research that we do at camp and at home, we will learn very little about the good of space exploration in the abstract, but we will hear quotes from pundits about the popularity of the plan, from IR scholars about the geo-strategic implications, from economists on the best ways to incentivize privatization, and from policy wonks about the political and technical difficulties of implementing space policy. The ironic thing is that as debaters cry that they are strengthening their research skills by reading these experts, they are __actively corroding__ their capabilities to construct an argument themselves using their critical thinking skills and their imaginations. The judgment of people we have never met are __substituted__ for independent judgment and primary research. Debate produces a large body of knowledge at the end of every topic that is largely __empty__ of independent ideas or accurate judgments. We might know in a very basic way the conclusions of NASA or the Space Policy Foundation, but we know almost __nothing__ about __how__ these people arrive at their conclusions or how these conclusions relate to us __personally__. Couple this with the explosion of questionable qualifications practices in which JD Candidates and Blogs are regularly put up on the pedestal of expertism, and debate’s reliance on evidence produces __emptiness__ in which we __don’t know what to say if we don’t have our blocks.__ 

This is dangerous because of the __insidious__ way that debate produces an arrogant attachment to the superiority of its own form of knowledge. Debaters leave the activity with arrogance that they are superior researchers while completely unaware that there is more to research than cutting Copley News Service and stringing together the latest exercise in argumentative stupidity that we call the Politics DA. Not only does it ill prepare students for life after debate, but it creates political docility because the smartest students among us __don’t know what to think__ unless they are __told so__ by experts. 

So we invite the other team to join us in affirming exploration, and by doing so to see the benefits of this commitment. We believe that this form of exploration is the most socially productive form possible. We will only deviate from this model if we are forced to by strategic choices by the negative, and will only do so with the intent of rupturing the form of debate from within. However, we warn them that the traditional model of debate and the way that they are likely to engage us in is both socially __debilitating__ and __makes the activity unsustainable in the long-term__. Vote affirmative to reclaim ourselves as ethical beings in this world, and simultaneously, to affirm the imperative to explore.

# A. Nuclear war is a fiction – used as a tool of fear in order to order a fundamentally un-orderable world. This replicates all their impacts and destroys value to life.

====Baudrillard- K 1NC==== 

The act of the 1AC is not out of benevolence – rather, we do it to feel good about ourselves. The only way to achieve this is to help other, human and nonhuman, to make us feel good about our position

====Cap K==== 
The affirmatives focus on the discursive/symbolic reveals the extent to which they have given up on actually challenging the structures of oppression. But far from being a post-capitalist age in which all social experience is textually or discursively produced, it is a material world. Only a materialist method can account for the ways in which certain classes create and deploy rhetoric to legitimize a capitalist mode of social relations

====Heidegger K==== 

A. __Link –__
The affirmative’s use of space strategy to secure warfighting is part of an insecure national ontology that guarantees violence.

**__<span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">Burke, 07</span>__** (Senior Lecturer in International Relations at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2 [Anthony, Johns Hopkins University Press, Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence and Reason, page @ http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v010/10.2burke.html]
The epistemology of violence I describe [...] violent global rule of the political.

B. __Impact –__
Extinction pales in comparison to the loss of our being – the assumption that loss of humanity outweighs is the link – only by accepting our finitude in comparison to Being can we open a clearing for existence.

Michael **__<span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">Zimmerman</span>__**, Professor of Philsophy, Tulane University, CONTESTING EARTH’S FUTURE, 19**__<span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">94</span>__**, p. 118-121.

Despite such differences with Heidegger, [...] Naess cites the following remarks. 62

C. The Alternative.

__Text__: Reject the affirmative in order to embrace meditative thought.

The question of this debate is one of competing ontologies. The affirmative’s calculative emphasis on quick-fix solutions ignores the root cause of their harms and ensures error replication – temporarily suspending our calculative thought is critical to re-engaging the ontological question
George **__<span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">Kouros</span>__**, Yale JD, Emory BA Philosophy, Become What you Are, 19**__<span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">97</span>__**, p. 22-25.
The thought that inhabits critique is [...] potential energy waiting to be unleashed.

====Sexy D K==== 
Bataille’s transgression is steeped in manliness—the masculine subject sustains his position via a feminine loss

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Surkis, 1996 </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">(Judith, Doctoral candidate in the History Dept. at Cornell University, “No Fun and Games Until Someone Loses and Eye: Transgression and Masculinity in Bataille and Foucault”, Diacritics, Vol. 26, No. 2, Project MUSE)</span>
In order for Foucault to envision [...] transgression? Who loses an eye?
Our ethics of sexual difference must come first--the Aff would bury women alive and cut them off from their own becoming--the lack of our ethics in epistemology guarantees extinction
**__<span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">Whitford</span>__**, **__<span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">1991</span>__**, <span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">(Margaret, Luce Irigaray: Philosophy in the Feminine, Chapter 7)</span>

Irigaray wants to restore the link [...] male discourse, and male society.
An ethics of sexual difference forms the basis for all encounters with Others. We must recognize that our sex means we can never complete ourselves as representative of humans, We can only encompass half of humanity at best. This is the negation of negation, denying the validity of drive based ethics and leading to true intersubjectivity

**__<span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">Schwab 98</span>__** (<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Gail, Diacrtics 28.1, sexual difference as model, project muse)</span>


For Irigaray, the way out [...] based relations: to true intersubjectivity.


====Taoism K==== 
No one knows what is good and bad. Reject the aff’s judgments, even if we lose all life on earth

====Positive Peace K====

THE IDEA THAT “PEACE” IS <span style="color: black;">THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF WAR DISABLES US FROM CHALLENGING STATE SPONSORED VIOLENCE AND MILITARISM.
