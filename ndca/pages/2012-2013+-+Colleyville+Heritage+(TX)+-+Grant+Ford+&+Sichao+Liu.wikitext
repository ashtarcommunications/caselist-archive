**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Solves the case – the CP encourages state experimentation with full privatization – this raises more capital than the plan and stimulates the economy without federal funding</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The CP’s experiment creates the political will for full-scale infrastructure privatization</span>**

He specializes in the analysis of and has written extensively on industrial organization, regulation, and transportation (Clifford, Last Exit: Privatization and Deregulation of the U.S. Transportation System, p. 2-3)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Do the </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">current problems with the transportation system suggest that the nation should</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> find a new stable equilibrium that will persist indefinitely?... </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">By producing greater understanding of how market forces could allocate transportation resources, </span>__the e__xperiments could guide widespread implementation of and justification for a new approach to transportation policy__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that could significantly improve the system’s performance.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">4 Net Benefits –</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">1. Productivity – federal planning undermines productivity because it can’t accurately respond to price signals. Private decision making more efficiently allocates resources tailored to economic need </span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Edwards 11 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">- director of tax policy studies at Cato. Before joining Cato, Edwards was a senior economist on the congressional Joint Economic Committee, a manager with PricewaterhouseCoopers, and an economist with the Tax Foundation (Chris, “Federal Infrastructure Investment” Congressional Testimony, 11/16, http://www.cato.org/publications/congressional-testimony/federal-infrastructure-investment)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the description of today's hearing, the committee asked how infrastructure helps to promote growth, jobs, and manufacturing... Some of that spending which was state, local, and private in nature included: $42.0 billion for highways, $16.8 billion for water and power projects, $14.3 billion for urban transit, $12.5 billion for community development, $12.5 billion for housing, and $3.5 billion for airports.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">2. Innovation – federal planning doesn’t accurately target infrastructure development to best meet economic need – mismanagement deepens economic problems</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Norcross and Sautet 09 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">– both are senior research fellows at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University (Eileen and Frederic, “THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT: Will More Public Spending Pave the Way to a Better Infrastructure?” SSRN)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Infrastructure development is not the cause of economic growth, but rather a consequence.6 Infrastructure is composed of economic assets... </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Consumers don’t obtain what they need and don’t pay for what they consume</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">3. Competitiveness – using private sector capital diverts it from other countries – maximizes competitiveness more effectively than public spending</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Staley 08 </span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">- senior research fellow at Reason Foundation and associate director of the DeVoe L. Moore Center at Florida State University in Tallahassee where he teaches graduate and undergraduate courses in urban planning, regulation, and urban economics (Samuel, “Gas Tax Increase or Private Capital?,” 7/16, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://reason.org/news/show/1006992.html]]</span>)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Congress isn't waiting to see who wins in November before deciding how to spend the next trillion dollars or so on the nation's roads, rails, bridges, and tunnels... </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Unless national transportation policy</span>__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">gets on track and</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> __embraces private capital, our transportation system will continue to lag far behind our global competitors__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">4. Data cooking - Public investment is manipulated by project managers who cook the data to win project approval – exaggerates aff benefits and causes massive cost overruns, and means better projects lose out</span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This situation may need some explication, because it may sound to many like an unlikely state of affairs... Both types of </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">accountability may be effective tools to curb misrepresentation in project management and to promote a culture which acknowledges and deals effectively with risk, especially where large amounts of taxpayers’ money are at stake</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and for projects with signiﬁcant social and environmental impacts, as is common with major infrastructure projects.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Data cooking creates economic disasters – the worst projects are approved, and necessary infrastructure loses out – this turns the case</span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In sum, the UK study shows that</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> __strong interests__ and s__trong incentives exist at the project-approval stage to present projects as favourably as possible__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—that is, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">w__ith beneﬁts emphasized and costs and risks de-emphasized__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">... </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">They have been designed</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">like that,</span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">as disasters waiting to happen</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
