====**1nc - security v.1**==== 
**Disorder and insecurity are inevitable because we live in a dangerous world. Efforts to control this fear have resulted in the deaths of millions and the creation of WMDs. The alternative is a negative gesture of indifference—we must learn to live with the world as it is. This allows us to break out of the death cycle.**
**Der Derian, 98**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (James, (Political Science Professor, University of Massachusetts)On Security, ed: Lipschitz, The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard, Decentering Security). </span>

__No other concept in international relations__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">packs the metaphysical punch, nor</span> __commands the disciplinary power of "security." In its name, people__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">s </span>__have alienated their fears, rights and powers to gods, emperors, and most recently, sovereign states, all to protect themselves__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from the vicissitudes of nature--as well as from other gods, emperors, and sovereign states. </span>__In its name, w__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">eapons of </span>__m__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ass </span>__d__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">estruction</span> __have been developed which have transfigured national interest into a security dilemma based on a suicide pact.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And, less often noted in international relations, </span>__in its name billions have been made and millions killed while scientific knowledge has been furthered and intellectual dissent muted.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">We have inherited an //ontotheology// of security, that is, an //a priori// argument that proves the existence and necessity of only one form of security because there currently happens to be a widespread, metaphysical belief in it. Indeed, within the concept of security lurks the entire history of western metaphysics, which was best described by Derrida "as a series of substitutions of center for center" in a perpetual search for the "transcendental signified." Continues... 7 In this case, Walt cites IR scholar Robert Keohane on the hazards of "reflectivism," to warn off anyone who by inclination or error might wander into the foreign camp: "As Robert Keohane has noted, until these writers `have delineated . . . a research program and shown . . . that it can illuminate important issues in world politics, they will remain on the margins of the field.' " 8 By the end of the essay, one is left with the suspicion that the rapid changes in world politics have triggered a "security crisis" in security studies that requires extensive theoretical damage control. </span>__What if we leave the desire for mastery to the insecure and instead imagine a new dialogue of security, not in the pursuit of a utopian end but in recognition of the world as it is, //other than us//__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">? What might such a dialogue sound like? Any attempt at an answer requires a genealogy: to understand the discursive power of the concept, to remember its forgotten meanings, to assess its economy of use in the present, to reinterpret--and possibly construct through the reinterpretation--a late modern security comfortable with a plurality of centers, multiple meanings, and fluid identities. The steps I take here in this direction are tentative and preliminary. I first undertake a brief history of the concept itself. Second, I present the "originary" form of security that has so dominated our conception of international relations, the Hobbesian episteme of realism. Third, I consider the impact of two major challenges to the Hobbesian episteme, that of Marx and Nietzsche. And finally, I suggest that Baudrillard provides the best, if most nullifying, analysis of security in late modernity. In short, I retell the story of realism as an historic encounter of fear and danger with power and order that produced four realist forms of security: epistemic, social, interpretive, and hyperreal. To preempt a predictable criticism, I wish to make it clear that </span>__I am not in search of an "alternative security."__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">An easy defense is to invoke Heidegger, who declared that "questioning is the piety of thought." Foucault, however, gives the more powerful reason for a genealogy of security: I am not looking for an alternative; you can't find the solution of a problem in the solution of another problem raised at another moment by other people. You see,</span> __what I want to do is not the history of solutions, and that's the reason why I don't accept the word //alternative// .__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">My point is not that everything is bad, but that</span> __everything is dangerous,__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> then we always have something to do. The hope is that</span> __in the interpretation of__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">the most pressing</span> __dangers__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of late modernity</span> __we might be able to construct a form of security based on the appreciation__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and articulation</span> __rather than the__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">normalization or</span> __extirpation of difference. Nietzsche transvalues__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> both Hobbes's and Marx's </span>__interpretations of security through a genealogy of modes of being. His method is__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">not to uncover some deep meaning or value for security, but </span>__to destabilize the intolerable fictional identities of the past which have been created out of fear, and to affirm the creative differences which might yield new values for the future__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Originating in the paradoxical relationship of a contingent life and a certain death, the history of security reads for Nietzsche as an abnegation, a resentment and, finally, a transcendence of this paradox. In brief,</span> __the history is one of individuals seeking an impossible security from the most radical "other" of life, the terror of death which, once generalized and nationalized, triggers a futile cycle of collective identities seeking security from alien others__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">--who are seeking similarly impossible guarantees.</span> __It is a story of differences taking on the otherness of death__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and identities calcifying into a fearful sameness. </span>

GIRDWOOD -- <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Anchorage Sen.</span> Lesil McGuire <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">thinks the state should build its own Polar-class icebreaker, much like the U.S. Coast Guard uses</span> for Arctic patrols.
The Coast Guard's two "heavy" icebreakers are out of commission right now, and the service is relying on one "medium" icebreaker -- primarily a scientific research vessel -- for anything that's needed in the Arctic.
The problem? Repairing or retrofitting an icebreaker costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Building a new one? Even more. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Congress has been reluctant to commission a new ship due to the high cost.</span> An April report by the Congressional Research Service put the pricetag of a new icebreaker at about $1 billion, $500 million to fix up one of the existing ships enough to last another 25 years. The heavy icebreakers have been in service more than 30 years.
McGuire, addressing the Arctic Imperative Conference that ended Tuesday night, called the icebreaker a "key part of the Arctic," <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">saying the Alaska Legislature should pay for one itself, using some of the billions of dollars the state has socked away in various budget reserve accounts</span>. The ship could be used for search and rescue operations and help in oil spill response, among other things.
