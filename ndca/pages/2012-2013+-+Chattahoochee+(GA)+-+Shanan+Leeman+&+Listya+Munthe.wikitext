=Negative= 
==Case Turns== 
===Stimulus Bad=== 
====1NC Generic==== 

**Keynesian theory is wrong—multiplier effect is small, investment causes crowding-out, and studies show negative correlation between spending and growth**

====1NC Competitiveness==== 
**More stimulus spending will kill competitiveness and crush the economy**

AND
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">to "fit in" that there are people trying to break out.</span>

**We co-opt the majority of their offense – topicality doesn’t seek to expunge critical thinking from debate. Their framework’s exclusive, moralizing presupposition that they have to be outside of the state prevents self-reflexivity and results in the total breakdown of dialogue and engagement**

The anti-political nature of guilt, in turn, helps explain the political

their belief in the futility, aggressivity, and dreariness of political action.


**Unlimited advocacy collapses into conservatism – our attempt to limit the discussion in a fair way enables productive political contestation and true revolutionary advocacies. Refusal to exclude anything means their framework is self-defeating**
