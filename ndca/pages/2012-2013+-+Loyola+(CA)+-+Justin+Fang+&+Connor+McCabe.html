Federalism -<br />
a.) The counterplan collapses federalism<br />

The United States Coast Guard is the nation’s primary at-sea law enforcement agency and its statutory…but the question of political responsibility between federal and state governments.<br />
<br />
b.) Federalism ensures global modeling – solves conflict, trade, and the economy<br />
Calabresi ’95 [Stephen, Associate Professor, Northwestern University School of Law. B.A. 1980, J.D. 1983, Yale, “Reflections on United States v.

First, the rules of constitutional federalism should be enforced because federalism is a good thing…if only the Justices and the legal academy would wake up to the importance of what is at stake.<br />
<br />
50 State Fiat is a voting issue -<br />
A. Not real world - there's no historical basis for all 50 states and territories simultaneously taking up a certain policy - this kills education about things that would actually happen in policy-making<br />
B. Multi-actor fiat is bad - it allows countless different actors at the same time - this is abusive and unpredictable for us to defend<br />
C. Counter interpretation - the negative can read any counter plan on which there is literature and a historical precedent - this insures a solvency advocate and offense for the affirmative.<br />

 1. Coviello- in a world where we construct apocalyptic threats the state co-opts these representations and use them to exterminate populations- this is the internal link to all of our irrationality claims. The state takes fear and uses to manage all forms of life.<br />
<br />
Aside from the irrationality impact we’ll isolate an independent DA to to the affirmative<br />
Under a framework of fear and security life loses all meaning entire populations can be exterminated in attempt to find security. Under this conception of life there is no meaning other than the security of the whole. Theres no reason to vote for the affirmative impacts when people have no meaning because they have been marginalized by the state.<br />
<br />
2. Der derian is the internal link to all of our case turn arguments- he says when we inject security it means our predictions of threats are flawed because of the irrationality security inspires.<br />
<br />
3. There’s no way the plan outweighs – they’ve conceded the link argument – it proves that all the 1AC impacts are constructs of the military industrial complex. Means that threats aren’t real and you shouldn’t give their advantages any weight.<br />

 Extend Burke here Individual advocacy in this round is crucial to the breaking down of security discourse, the way we present arguments influences how we act in terms of political advocacy. Security operates through the lens of state social mapping. People are told they are inherently violent, and it acts as a control mechanism. This round isn’t about whether or not the plan actually happens its about the personal accountability for the impacts. Burke says only through rejecting the way security affects our lives on individual basis and our power to change. The affirmative literally discourse feeds into a power system that makes life meaningless.<br />
<br />
Burke indicates that and individual rejection of irrational security is the critical first step in breaking it down. Many movements for liberation have started from the basis of a few individuals. This grassroots movement will be able to change the way the United States operates in foreign policy through proactive change.<br />
<br />
Thus the role of the ballot serves as two fold<br />
1. To recognize that humans aren’t inherently violent-ask yourself when the last time you killed someone was. People are only violent in the context of the state lens that’s coviello. This rejection of this cop out is necessary for coalition building- too create a positive basis for change.<br />
2. The alternative should be evaluated before the case, if we win that violence is only inevitable when we accept as being thus we open the possibility for the wholesale rejection of state based security. Means we solve all of the aff’s internal links and avoid our net benefits of state genocide, and the case turns.<br />

B. Fairness- Critiques are a key part of negative strategy we need them too to beat back unpredictable affs.<br />
C. Education- The affirmatives interpretation kills all philosophical education by ruling out any critique alternatives. This philosophical education is good in learning about different worldviews.<br />
D. Fiat is illusory- no coherent reason why simulating the case is good at best the judge too default to what he has control over- the discourse in this round.<br />

 Extend Burke here Individual advocacy in this round is crucial to the breaking down of security discourse, the way we present arguments influences how we act in terms of political advocacy. Security operates through the lens of state social mapping. People are told they are inherently violent, and it acts as a control mechanism. This round isn’t about whether or not the plan actually happens its about the personal accountability for the impacts. Burke says only through rejecting the way security affects our lives on individual basis and our power to change. The affirmative literally discourse feeds into a power system that makes life meaningless.<br />
<br />
Burke indicates that and individual rejection of irrational security is the critical first step in breaking it down. Many movements for liberation have started from the basis of a few individuals. This grassroots movement will be able to change the way the United States operates in foreign policy through proactive change.<br />
<br />
Thus the role of the ballot serves as two fold<br />
1. To recognize that humans aren’t inherently violent-ask yourself when the last time you killed someone was. People are only violent in the context of the state lens that’s coviello. This rejection of this cop out is necessary for coalition building- too create a positive basis for change.<br />
2. The alternative should be evaluated before the case, if we win that violence is only inevitable when we accept as being thus we open the possibility for the wholesale rejection of state based security. Means we solve all of the aff’s internal links and avoid our net benefits of state genocide, and the case turns.<br />

 1. All of our links prove that the alternative is a mutually exclusive with the view of security the affirmative perpetuates.<br />
<br />
2. Coviello acts a DA to the permutation extend that under a framework of fear life loses meaning. Theres a risk that all the aff’s body claim don’t matter<br />
<br />
3. The aff’s belief in the need for a technical, legislative fix for the environment paralyzes environmentalism<br />
Shellenberger and Nordhous, 4 [Michael and Ted, political strategist and executive director of the Breakthrough Institute and Vice President of Evans/McDonough “The Death of Environmentalism” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:5045:http://www.thebreakthrough.org/images/Death_of_Environmen --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thebreakthrough.org/images/Death_of_Environmen" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebreakthrough.org/images/Death_of_Environmen</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:5045 --> talism.pdf]<br />
Those of us who were children during the birth of the modern environmental movement have no idea…such as lobbying, third-party allies, research reports, advertising, and public relations.<br />
<br />
4. The perm is severance- You can’t kick out of the way you frame your impacts and the necessary responses in the 1ac- it’s a voter<br />
A. Ground- the aff can just kick out of everything in the world where severance is justified- means the neg doesn’t have any kind of basis for writing positions<br />
B. Fairness- If the 1AC can spike out of any position it means that we will also lose on the negative<br />
<br />
5. It’s net beneficial to do the alt by itself- only then can we avoid all of the case turn arguments<br />

 Our interpretation is that the affirmative should have to present a topical plan action and should have to justify its representations.<br />
<br />
Reasons to prefer<br />
A. Ground- if the negative were tied down only to CP’s and the status quo the 2ac would win every round by reading a ton of add-ons.<br />
B. Fairness- Critiques are a key part of negative strategy we need them too to beat back unpredictable affs.<br />
C. They’re predictable- K’s and frameworks have been around for a long time no reason they shouldn’t be able to predict them.<br />
D. Education- The affirmatives interpretation kills all philosophical education by ruling out any critique alternatives. Nobody would run them anymore because alternatives are key to winning k debates. This philosophical education is good in learning about different worldviews.<br />
E. Fiat is illusory- no coherent reason why simulating the case is good at best the judge too default to what he has control over- the discourse in this round.<br />

Discourse shapes the environment – not the other way around<br />

A discourse-analytic approach is appropriate in that discourses are powerful forces within policy debates…the use of one discourse over another has important implications, both theoretically and practically.<br />

And, Security discourse defines who deserves authority – these discourses shape policy by determining what can and cannot be thought<br />

One implication of this data is that if Congress wants to boost infrastructure spending, the first priority ...by devolving it to state and local governments and the private sector.<br />

 The counterplan solves the entirety of the case – the internal links to their advantages are based off of the result of the implementation of the plan – not the implementation itself. The CP results in the same form of transportation infrastructure – means the CP solves the advantages.<br />

 Extend our two pieces of Wachs evidence - they can’t solve job growth and make it worse<br />
1. They hurt the economy in the short term – construction jobs and expenditure on resources are wasteful spending that doesn’t do anything because it doesn’t immediately increase productivity. This is analogous to the broken window fallacy. We could intentionally break a ton of windows and hire a bunch of workers to repair them, but that doesn’t produce anything or increase the amount of goods in the economy – it merely shifts who has possession of money which proves our crowd out argument.<br />

Prefer our evidence – it indicts the methodology of theirs – warming claims are exaggerated and have little scientific basis. Scientists manipulate findings to ensure their funding. To keep Congress interested, they must come up with interesting theories.

 First the link – Increasing CO2 boosts ag yields which solves the impact of warming on agriculture – it stimulates faster growth and resistance to the environment – plants will be able to withstand drought, pollutants, and temperature extremes – that’s Balgord. This prevents starvation on a massive scale – our Idso &amp; Idso evidence says that letting CO2 stimulation of plants run its natural evolutionary course is the only way to sustain crop growth which is key to global food sufficiency – empirically CO2 stimulation works and it’s the only way to prevent starvation.<br />
<br />
Two impacts<br />
<br />
First – it’s a moral side constraint – ignoring the needs of starving people when we have the means to save them is the equivalent of looking another person in the face and killing them – we should not condemn innocents to die in the name of questionable environmental science –Andre &amp; Velasquez.<br />
<br />
Second – ag shortages are the root cause of global warfare means their impacts are inevitable – wars empirically have started due to poverty in countries who depend on ag and the reverse is also true, sustainable ag drive growth and development because CO2 plays an important role in the photosynthetic process which is the foundation of life – AND they make future wars inevitable - expanding population growth necessitates increase in food production which is only possible with current levels of CO2 emissions – Idso &amp; Idso<br />
