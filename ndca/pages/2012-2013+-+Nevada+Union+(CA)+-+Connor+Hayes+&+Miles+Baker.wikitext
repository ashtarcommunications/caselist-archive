**Ever heard of Nevada Union before? Hint: it’s not in Nevada, though its understandable that everyone just assumes that it is. After all, we are just some hillbilly backwater, so there’s no need to get into uber- specific stuff like what state we are from.**

**Moreover, there’s no need to remember, I suppose, that Nevada County predates the state of Nevada by a good ten years, that our town is where the gold rush began. It hardly bears notice that it is a vibrant place full of art and culture. Forget our Pulitzer prize winning poets, world-famous musicians, international film festivals, and stunning natural beauty because we don’t have a shopping mall. Our rural identity means that we will always have to confront the assumption that we are just dumb hicks.**

**<span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">This is personal for us. Our rural community, like so many others, faces a shrinking population and therefore shrinking tax base. With state funds wrapped up in securing the urban prison-industrial complex, our school was forced to lay off a dozen teachers including our debate coach. This is the dominant trend formed by ruralism. Any kind of curricular enrichment is cut first. Turns out, there’s some evidence that we aren’t alone.</span>**
**Ruralism leads to separate but (not) equal education, particularly with regard to the ability to get transportation to extracurricular activities like debate. We have to drive nearly everywhere we go. We have no school debate budget. The only reason we have a coach is because our parents pay his salary. The amount of tournaments we attend is severely limited because we just don’t have the transportation to get there. We sit through 14 hour car rides to vegas just get to a bid tournament, and we can’t go to many because we’re limited to regional tournaments, which, as seems hella obvious by now, really aint much.**

**As a child, found it difficult to make friends. I had a lot of friends at school, but I live in an area secluded from everyone I knew, really. Because my parents my parents were always busy, I was forced to stay cooped up on our property, trying to entertain myself as a 10 year old. You know what happens when 10 year old is at home alone every day all summer? He plays video games. A lot. Exercise? Not so much. Because of simple facts like this, I developed a weight problem as a younger child. Sure, the physical impacts of this have largely gotten better, but the emotional impact that had on me and my self-confidence wasn’t so easy to repair, and still hasn’t completely healed.**

But that’s only the beginning. Rural discrimination is not just limited to “the real world.” Lack of educational opportunities combined with Stereotyping means that rural dwellers are marginalized in competitive intellectual settings.

**I come from Nevada County. A place located in the Foothills of the Sierra Nevada’s and consisting of two main towns, Nevada City and Grass valley. We are decidedly rural. Our roads and houses are shrouded by the mass forests that surround and we are over an hour away from the nearest city. I hope you visit sometime for it is truly a special place. The Yuba river represents our cultural mekka, a place we cherish and peacefully coexist with. We have an incredible community of artists and a supportive and caring population of genuine people. We have two public high schools; I attend the larger of the two, Nevada Union. Our relationship with debate is a testament to the power of human engagement and commitment. Through total serendipity, we came across our current coach, He has been driving an hour up to our little mountain town to help some kids pro bono for 15 years. All while being a legal aid lawyer and trombonist. Without this, we would be like most rural schools, doing stock issues debate in our local leagues without knowing what else was possible or having the ability to compete with it. Our location and budget issues would make competing impossible without a dedicated group of parents and the past successes of Nevada Union teams leading the way.**

As long as their ambiguity … <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">overlook the moment of awakening.</span>

Connecting rural communities to the totality of social relations is essential to combat oppressive practice

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">We propose a non-literal relationship to the resolution that arises from our lived experience of it. If you insist on involving the resolution in this debate, think of it metaphorically. In the context of this policy debate, the judge represents the federal government and is posed with the question of whether or not to invest in transportation infrastructure. The best investment he/she can make is an investment in transporting the organic intellectualism and experience of rural debaters into the community. The best infrastructure investment one can make in such transportation is a ballot.</span>


Role-Playing reduces debaters to nothing but spectators, forced to treat what should be public advocacy into simple competition. Their agency is further reduced as they retreat farther and farther from real politics

We may not change debate right away, but our argument is centrally that what we say and think matters, no matter what place we are in. Debate is where we are.

This piece of music, from a local band in our town, talks about a bottle alone in the ocean, but even if that message is not heard its meaning still matters. Traditional approaches to policy reproduce the same problems that we already have

Recognition of the power disparity between urban and rural is the only way to address structural discrimination in not just services, transportation, education, poverty and environmental degradation, but also in the debate community.

====Fem K of Neoclassical Econ==== 

<span style="display: block; font-size: 16px; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;">The neoclassical economic models employed in the 1AC calculate rationality based on masculine perceptions of what holds value. This narrow thinking excludes constructivist, feminist analyses of economics.</span>

[Julie, Economics Professor at Brandeis University, “The Masculine Mindset of Economic Analysis,” Chronicle of Higher Education 42(42), June 1996, p. B3]

__The central model of economics … a sign of narrow, biased thinking.__


<span style="display: block; font-size: 16px; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;">This masculine interpretation ignores cooperation, empathy, and other values which influence economic bargaining. The affirmative’s subscription to this gendered version of economic modeling leads nations to war and environmental destruction by perpetuating the idea of competition</span>

__Neoclassical economics panders to the …__ fulfillment of their human potential.


<span style="display: block; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;">The alternative is an abandonment of economist’s love affair with Adam Smith’s competitive economy model. We must turn to cooperative bargaining models and constructivist analyses</span>

**Our alternative is to reject the aff. Domination is perpetuated by the ability of those in power to define the discursive framing of the field of contestation.

**__The new militarism is best … peace, perhaps even planetary survival.__**


**Our alternative is to de-miliarize the debate space. This requires us as an academic community to stop finding an aff on every topic that fetishizes military power and instead debate policymaking in a manner that addresses social and political concerns.**
