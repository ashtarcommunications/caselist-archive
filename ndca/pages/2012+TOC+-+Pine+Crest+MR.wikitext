__The notion of objective violence needs to be thoroughly historicised: it took on … situation is “financially sound”—**reality doesn’t matter,** what matters is the situation of capital__...

If there is a unifying thesis that runs through the bric-a-brac of reflections on …<span style="font-size: 8px;"> virtue of that clarity.2 The only appropriate approach to my subject thus seems to be one which permits variations on violence kept at a distance out of respect towards its victims.</span>

Widespread opposition to Dr. Graham is buttressed by the unquestioned need for a balanced leader at OIRA. This office <span class="underline0">is the gatekeeper of OMB’s regulatory review </span>process, and dictates the creation and use of analytical methodologies that other agencies must employ when developing protections for public health, consumers, and the environment. <span class="underline0">In his role as gatekeeper</span>, Dr<span class="underline0">. Graham </span>will have the ability to stop much-needed protections before they ever see the light of day. In his role as director of analysis, he will be able to manipulate agency rulemakings—without Congressional approval <span class="underline0">or </span>adequate <span class="underline0">public discussion—</span>by issuing new OMB policies that force other agencies to conform to his narrow and highly controversial philosophy. This could result in a weakening of current protections, and a failure to create adequate future safeguards.

(Note: Dr. John Graham – internally referenced – was the former Head of OIRA, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. He was also Ross Smith’s college debate partner. He did both 2’s. Dr. Graham is now a Dean at Indiana University and has played a large role in the creation of their debate program).
