Email Dustin at dustml94[at]gmail[dot]com for aff/neg cites- if I don't respond promptly for neg stuff, email Jon at jon.x.yangz[at]gmail[dot]com.

I'll try to get all cites for everything we've read up as quickly as possible - the only things I probably won't be putting up as promptly (if at all) is politics uniqueness. I'll also be including past 1NCs/2NRs for all the tournaments we go to. I don't think I'll be putting up full text for now, just for organizational purposes, but if you need full text just let me (or Jon if I don't get back to you) know and I'll send you it ASAP.

Pre-Blake note: My regular computer is out of commission until Blake, so I won't be able to get some cites from Dowling up - if anyone needs something email me anyways, it might just take a little longer

Any and all questions about arguably esoteric arguments we read should only be directed at Jon - he may redirect you to me, but trust me, he's the one who goes for D&G and wipeout. Trust me. Ask him multiple times.

[[2011-2012 - Edina (MN) - Dustin Meyers-Levy & Jon Yang - Aff - Asteroid Property Rights]]

Affs read per tournament:

**Greenhill**: SPS Poverty and Satellite Hardening
**Valley**: Satellite Hardening
**UMN**: Satellite Hardening
**St Marks**: (Note: DML was with Sam Lagerstrom) Satellite Hardening and D&G
**Caucus**: (DML was with Madeleine Hage - that yung Jon Yang keeps missing those tournaments) all three of the above
**Michigan**: Satellite Hardening and D&G
**Highland Park**: (DML was with a novice) Asteroids (check SS's wiki; it's the exact same minus the small asteroids advantage)
**Glenbrooks**: D&G (plus a plan text one round!) and Satellite Hardening
**Dowling**: (was with Erin Sielaff) Sat Hardening and D&G
**Blake**: Sat Hardening
**Sections/Gonzaga:** Sat Hardening/D&G
**State**: Sat Hardening/GPS in GEO
**Emory** (with Madeleine): Sat Hardening (round 6 new plan text/solvency mechanism - quantum dot technology)
**Hoflo** (also with madeleine): Sat Hardening (round 4 read a weaponization advantage) and Asteroid Property Rights
**NDCA** (with Samantha Hunt, god dammit Jon): Asteroid Property Rights, Sat Hardening, and D&G

=Negative= 

Note: you should email Jon for weaponization cites if you need them, as he (as of UMN) has taken it in the block and thus I don't know what cards he's read.
