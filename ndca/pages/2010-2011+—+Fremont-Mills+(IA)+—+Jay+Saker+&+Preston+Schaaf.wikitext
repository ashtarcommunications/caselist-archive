===Intro / Overview=== 

[[image:Cannibal.jpg caption="Cannibalism's good, ok?"]]


===1AC=== 


//[Garry Hogg; “Cannibalism and Human Sacrifice;” quoting the Rev. James Chalmers in “Life and Work in New Guinea;” 1895]//
__The Rev. James Chalmers, one of a long line of amazingly courageous missionaries__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> who have worked there, </span>__and all too often fallen victims to the very practices they had devoted their lives to attempting to eradicate, was successful in discovering the legend underlying cannibalism in New Guinea. There is a curious parallel,__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> here, </span>__to the Garden of Eden story, and one is inclined to suspect that the native who told him the legend was already a convert, and had learned at any rate the basic Old Testament story!__
__I asked him__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [Chalmers records] </span>//__why__// __they ate human flesh. He told me that it was the women of the tribes who first urged the men to kill their fellow human beings for the purpose of eating them. The husbands were__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the man told me, </span>__returning from a successful hunt far inland. As was their custom, they were blowing their conch-shells and singing and dancing.__
__As they approached the village, coming down the river in their canoes piled high with wallabies, boars and cassowaries, the women called out to them: ‘What success, husbands, that you sing and dance so?’ ‘Great success,’ the men shouted back. ‘Plenty to eat. Here, come and see for yourselves.’__
__The women approached the canoes, and when they saw what was in them, they called out: ‘What, just that dirty stuff?’__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And then, in voices of scorn: </span>__‘Who is going to eat that?__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Is that what you call successful hunting?’ </span>
__Then the men began reasoning among themselves: ‘What do our wives mean, mocking us like this?’__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And one of them, wiser than the others, said after much thought: </span>__‘I know. They want the flesh of //man//!’__
__Then, throwing the wallabies and boars and cassowaries over the sides of their canoes, they went quickly along the river to a neighbouring village and brought back with them ten bodies. But__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the man said to me, </span>__the men returned in their canoes without their usual singing and rejoicing.__
__When the women who were waiting for them on the river bank saw them approaching the village, they called out: ‘What have our husbands brought for us to eat, this time?’ And then they looked, but their husbands did not look at them, only cast their eyes downwards at what lay in their canoes. ‘Yes, that is right!’ shouted the women. ‘Dance and sing again, now, for you have brought back with you something worth dancing and singing about!’__
__Then the ten bodies were taken out of the canoes and put on the river bank. And the women cooked them, and pronounced them good. And from that day till now, the men and women of these tribes have always said that the flesh of human beings is better than the flesh of any other animal.__


**THE VILLAGERS OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA ENTER A SACRED AND HOLY UNION WITH THE BODY – THEY RECOGNIZE THAT LIFE IS LIMITED AND SACRED, AND ENGAGE IN THE POT-LATCH OF THE COMMUNITY, SACRIFICING INDIVIDUALS FOR THE REBIRTH OF LIFE. MURRAY EXPLAINS THAT THE CONSUMPTION OF FLESH IS AN ETHICAL REQUIREMENT IN ORDER TO CREATE THE COMMUNITY.**
//[JHP Murray, Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Judicial Officer of Papua New Guniea; “////Papua, or British New Guinea;” published 1912]//
__Certain tribes here like human flesh and do not see why they should not eat it. Indeed, I have never been able to give a convincing answer to a native who says to me, ‘Why should I not eat human flesh?...’__
__The people of the Purari Delta are naturally secretive as to their religious beliefs and practices, and not inclined to discuss them__ with strangers, but information emerges in the course of trials and official investigations. For instance, __in the year 1909 I tried a man called Avai,__ a native of Baimuru, who was charged with the murder of a woman of Baroi. His statement contained some curious details. __He said; ‘Bai-i told us to kill three Baroi people. We caught Aimari and his two wives, in Era Bay. Kairi killed Aimari. I killed one wife, and Iomu the other. I killed the women with a dagger of cassowary bone. We put the bodies in the canoe and took them back with us. I did not bite off the woman's nose. It is not our custom to bite off the nose of a person you have killed. If I kill a man or a woman, someone else bites off his nose. We bit off the noses of people that //others// have killed. We //bite// them off; we do not //cut// them off.__
__‘We left the three bodies in our canoe till morning. Then we took them into our village and put them on the platform. Then we singed them, cut them up into small pieces, mixed the pieces__ with sago, __cooked them, wrapped them up__ in leaves of nipa-palm, __and distributed them. I ate a hand of one woman__, but it was not the hand of the woman I myself killed. __It is not our custom to eat a person we have ourselves killed.__ But __if, after killing a man, you go and sit on a coconut,__ with also a coconut under each heel, __and get your daughter to boil the man's heart, then you may drink the water in which the heart has been boiled. And you may eat a little of the heart also, but you must be sitting on the coconuts all the time.’__


**FOR THE GUNIANS, THE PREPARATION OF FOOD IS A JUST DEATH. THEY ARE A PEOPLE THAT LIVE WITH DIGNITY AND THEY KILL WITH DIGNITY. THIS RECOGNIZES THE OTHER AS AN OTHER, RESPECTFULLY, FACE TO FACE.**
**//Walker, ‘09//**
//[HW Walker; “Wanderings Among South Sea Savages;” published 1909]//
__We decided to rush the village of Kanau, but when we got there we found it deserted.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In the centre of the village was a kind of small, raised platform, on which were </span>__rows of human skulls and quantities of bones, the remnants of many a gruesome cannibal feast. Many of the skulls were quite fresh,__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with small bits of meat still sticking to them, but for all that, they had been picked very clean. </span>__Every skull had a large hole punched in the side,__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> varying in size but uniform as regards position. The explanation for this we soon learnt from the Notus, and later it was confirmed by our prisoners. </span>
__When the Doboduras capture an enemy, they slowly torture him to death, practically eating him alive. When he is almost dead, they make a hole in the side of the head and scoop out his brains with a kind of wooden spoon.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> These brains, which are often warm and fresh, were regarded as a great delicacy. No doubt the Notus recognized some of their relatives amid the ghastly relics... </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">We were talking in subdued tones for some time, expecting every moment to hear the thrilling war-cry of the Doboduras. We could hear the dismal falsetto howls of the native dogs in the distance, and they were not particularly exhilarating at such a time, and I more than once mistook them for distant war-cries. </span>
__The Papuans do not as a rule torture their prisoners for the mere idea of torture,__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> though they have often been known to roast a man alive – for the reason that his meat is supposed to taste better thus. I have heard of cases of white men having been roasted alive, one case being that of two miners, Campion and King. But we had learned that this Dobodura tribe had a system of torture that was brutal beyond words. </span>
__In the first place they always try to wound slightly, and capture a man alive, so that they can have fresh meat for many days. They keep their prisoners tied up alive in the huts, and cut out pieces of their flesh just when they want them;__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> we were told that, incredible as it may seem, </span>__they sometimes manage to keep them alive for a week or more, and have some preparation which prevents them from bleeding to death.__
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Monkton advised both Acland and myself to shoot ourselves with our revolvers if we saw that we were overwhelmed, so as to escape these terrible tortures, and he assured us that he should keep the last bullet in his revolver for himself. </span>


**<span class="cite">AND, ONLY CANNIBALISM RECOGNIZES THE OTHER AS WHAT THEY ARE. IT PREVENTS US FROM ELIMINATING THEM, THEIR CULTURE, OR THEIR RIGHTS. BROWN ’07 EXPLAINS THAT CANNIBALISM MAKES GENOCIDE UNTHINKABLE.</span>**
//<span style="color: #1a1718;">[Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science (Chris, </span>////<span style="color: #0e0e0e;">“The International Political Thought of Carl Schmitt: Terror, Liberal War, and the Crisis of Global Order” 2007, </span>////<span style="color: #1a1718;">Fellow in International Relations at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and also teaches Inter- national Relations at the University ‘L’Orientale’ in Naples, Italy</span>////<span style="color: #0e0e0e;"> p. 60-61,]</span>//
<span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">The line of argument here is immediately, if superficially, familiar: Just War justifies escalation, feeds self-righteousness, legitimizes war – this is very much the contemporary critique of Just War thinkiAng as presented, from different perspectives, by Booth and other critics. There is, however, an important difference; </span>__<span style="color: #1a1718;">Schmitt </span>__<span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">does not dodge the Henny Youngman question. He </span>__<span style="color: #1a1718;">is quite clear that there is **an alternative normative and conceptual framework** against which Just War thinking ought to be judged</span>__<span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">, and much of //The// Nomos //of the Earth// is devoted to defending this alternative and bemoaning its delegitimation by the sea-going Anglo-Saxons, who promote a conception of world order that has had the effect of reinstating the medievalism and extremism of the Just War. </span>**__<span style="color: #1a1718;">This alternative framework emerges from the development of the sovereign</span>__**__<span style="color: #1a1718;">, territorial **state** in Europe, which involved a spatial disposition of the Continent</span>__<span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;"> that undermined the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church and the Empire. </span>__<span style="color: #1a1718;">The political order is no longer committed to the preservation of God’s Order in the world, and the staving off of the reign of the Antichrist, but instead is based on Reason of State</span>__<span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">.4 The European </span>__<span style="color: #1a1718;">princes create </span>__<span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">among themselves a //jus publicum Europaeum//, </span>__<span style="color: #1a1718;">a secular legal order under which they recognize each other’s rights and interests</span>__<span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">, //within Europe// (the proviso here is crucial). Beyond the line, in the extra-European world, Europeans engage in large-scale appropriations of land, respecting neither the rights of the locals nor each other’s rights, but within Europe a different //modus vivendi// is possible. In the extra-European world appalling atrocities occur which would not happen, or at least ought not to happen, in Europe.5 </span>__<span style="color: #1a1718;">As between European rulers within Europe, war became ‘bracketed’ – rationalized and humanized. Rather than a divine punishment, war became an act of state. **Whereas in the medieval order the enemy must necessarily be seen as unjust**</span>__ <span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">(the alternative being that one was, oneself, unjust – clearly an intolerable prospect), </span>**__<span style="color: #1a1718;">the new humanitarian approach</span>__**__<span style="color: #1a1718;"> to war **involved the possibility of the recognition of the other as** a //justus hostis//, **an enemy but a legitimate enemy, not someone who deserves to be annihilated, but** someone in whom one can recognize oneself, always a good basis for a degree of restraint</span>__<span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">. This, for Schmitt, is the great achievement of the age, and the ultimate justification for – glory of, even – the sovereign state. [An] international legal order, based on the liquidation of civil war and on the bracketing of war (in that it transformed war into a duel between Euro- pean states), actually had legitimated a realm of relative reason. </span>**__<span style="color: #1a1718;">The equality of sovereigns made them equally legal partners in war, and prevented military methods of annihilation</span>__**__<span style="color: #1a1718;">.</span>__<span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;"> (Schmitt 2003: 142) </span>__<span style="color: #1a1718;">The new thinking about war also opened up the possibility of neutrality as a legal status; since war was no longer justified in accordance with</span>__<span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;"> a theological judgement based on </span>__<span style="color: #1a1718;">notions of good and evil, it became possible for third parties to stand aside if their interests were not engaged</span>__<span style="color: #1a1718; font-size: 8pt;">. Equally, the ordinary subjects of belligerent rulers need not feel obliged to become emotionally engaged in the fray. War becomes a matter for sovereigns and their servants, civil and military; the kind of wider involvement that might be appropriate to a war between good and evil becomes strictly optional.6 Thus was established what Schmitt clearly regarded as a kind of golden age in European international relations, a golden age that would be sabotaged in the twentieth century by the United States, with the reluctant, ambiguous, assistance of the United Kingdom – two maritime powers whose commitment to the //jus publicum Europaeum// was highly qualified in the case of the UK, non-existent in the case of the US.</span>


**AND, MAINTAINING OUR EXTENSIVE MILITARY PRESENCE OF BASES AND SOLDIERS AND DOGS OVERSEAS IS THE ONLY THING PREVENTING CANNIBALISM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WITHDRAWING THESE TROOPS SENDS A SIGNAL THAT OUR POLICY HAS CHANGED FROM “DON’T EAT YOUR FELLOW MAN,” TO “CHOW DOWN.”**
**//Independent, ‘09//**
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">FEW people paid any attention to evidence given in the <span style="color: black;">International Criminal Court</span> in the Hague earlier this year at the trial for crimes against humanity of <span style="color: black;">Jean-Pierre Bemba</span>, leader of one of the rebel militias involved in atrocities in Congo in 2003 and 2004 -- and still engaged in the same activities. The evidence may be too upsetting for civilised people to contemplate.</span>
__During the worst of the conflict word began to emerge that Bemba's Congolese Liberation Movement, with food difficult to find, were eating children.__
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Eddy Isango, a highly regarded Associated Press journalist who writes for the <span style="color: black;">London</span> Independent, the Guardian and the Scotsman, reported in March 2005 that a witness from </span>__a pygmy tribe told UN investigators that Bemba's men "grilled bodies on a spit and boiled two girls alive as their mother watched".__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It was one of many such reports. The witness, Zainabo Alfani, told the war crime investigators that she was forced to watch rebels kill and eat two of her children in June 2003. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The report said: </span>__"In one corner, there was already cooked flesh from bodies and two bodies being grilled on a barbecue; and at the same time, they prepared her two little girls, putting them alive into two big pots filled with boiling water and oil."__
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A security source in the region who spoke to the Sunday Independent recently said </span>__that these practices are still going on. "They go into a village and kill most the adults. They rape the women before they kill them. They take the children with them. When they get hungry they cook them."__
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The West pays, no attention to events in the worst war-torn parts of <span style="color: black;">Africa</span>. </span>__The cannibalism stories were reported at the time.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Wyger Wentholt, a doctor with the French aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres was quoted in a report in the Guardian in January 2003 as saying: </span>__"We are hearing reports of untold horrors in Lturi (in north west Congo)" where the rebels were routinely eating members of the pygmy tribes in the region.__
__No one knows how many met their deaths in Congo during this period but estimates are as high as 2.5 million, far outstripping the genocide in <span style="color: black;">Darfur</span>.__
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It would seem that few in the West actually care. The biggest "atrocity" story about the rebels in the Western media was when park rangers across the border in Senegal said that rebels had killed and eaten two mountain gorillas in January 2007.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The case against Bemba is unlikely to succeed, as he has established that he was not directly involved and not in Congo at the time. The evidence, supported by witness accounts, of what his troops did, and are still doing, is truly horrific. </span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The court heard the rebels used the rape of women and children as well as murder and cannibalism as a means of destroying and traumatising the people in the Bangui, Boy-Rabe and Mongoumba areas who supported rivals of the Congolese Liberation Movement. There is no talk of central Africa or Darfur or Sudan or Somalia among the 'No' campaigners who are again raising the scare tactic of a "militarised" Europe. The reality is that it is easier for European governments to do nothing about Africa. </span>__It took an enormous effort to get the EU intervention force of only 5,000 soldiers,__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> including 400 Irish, </span>__into eastern Chad to bring some stability to the region and protect the hundreds of thousands of refugees who survived the genocide in Darfur. Despite its enormous resources, the EU barely mustered a dozen helicopters to support the military action.__
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The mission involved considerable hardship for the troops. The Irish Ranger Wing troops, who led the vanguard for the setting up of the military camps around the town of Abeche, lived on dry rations for months as no other food was available. </span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Although it was not publicised at the time, about 80 per cent of the Rangers contracted mysterious, debilitating illnesses, possibly including cholera. They still held on and provided security as the military bases were set up. </span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">With the closure of the year-long EU mission and the handing over to a much less effective UN force, the Irish battalion has had to stay on to provide some kind of protection for the refugees who again face a bleak future. </span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The unofficial government of south Sudan and the government in the north are preparing for the possibility of war next year when the South holds a referendum on independence. This will entail a renewal of the genocide in what remains of the Darfur region, and again the West will again look on in horror but will probably do nothing to prevent it. </span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Chad was the first expedition into Africa by the EU's much-vaunted Rapid Reaction Force. If the No campaigners were to have their way, it could well be the last that Irish troops will be involved in. It was, while it lasted, a successful example of what a small, well-ordered Western force can achieve in a region torn apart by warring militias. The murderous militias across Africa are not capable of facing professional soldiers who can provide the security needed for charities and UN officials to supply humanitarian need.</span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The best example of how a small but highly professional military force can bring about a rapid end to genocide was in Sierra Leone in May 2002. At the time rebel groups, particularly the militia known as the West Side Niggaz (as they named themselves and not the "West Side Boys" as they were wrongly termed in politically correct Western news reports) were cutting people's arms off during a campaign of terror to stop elections -- if people have no hands, they reckoned, they cannot vote.</span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The British Prime Minister at the time, Tony Blair, was horrified by the images and reports emerging from the country and acted unilaterally by sending a parachute regiment force from the carrier HMS Ocean. </span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Within days the paratroopers had driven the rebel group from the capital, Freetown, and brought peace and security to the city which had been on the verge of being overrun and its citizens slaughtered. The intervention allowed the UN, supported by private security firms, to first restore order in the capital and later in the rest of the country. Irish troops were later deployed to neighbouring Liberia where there had also been rebel atrocities. The Lisbon Treaty actually has the effect of pushing the highly reticent EU member states to do more about places like these, proposing that EU states improve their military capability and engage in tasks such as "joint disarmament operations...military advice and assistance tasks ... tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking and post conflict stabilization". </span>
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The treaty also states that all actions, as the intervention in Chad was, will be under United Nations mandate. The No campaigners, led by Sinn Fein which has spent thousands of euro plastering posters of a tank and "no to militarisation" across the country, equate the proposals on military intervention to prevent genocide in third world countries to some kind of huge multi-national EU force bent on re-colonising the region. </span>
__The only "militarisation" being put forward is the type that would end the eating of children and the other horrific acts of genocides.__

The Obama administration is clearly concerned. 
"The nature and scope of Iran's nuclear program causes the U.S. and the international community to question whether Iran's nuclear intentions are peaceful," says National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The prime minister argues that he is not shifting the country from West to East -- he is still a vocal advocate of Turkey's EU accession, for example. However, he knows well that his popularity on the Arab street is not due to the Arab world's appreciation for Turkey's founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, but because he is taking their side against Israel and its Western allies. </span>
