=Affirmative= 

First, US military basing is expanding in Korea despite opposition by local populations

And, despite the “zero tolerance” policy and executive orders, military prostitution and immunity from prosecution for sex crimes continues in the context of Korea 
<span class="cite">Kirk, 2008</span> (Gwyn, Prof Women’s Studies @ Antioch & Hamilton Universities & Founder of East Asia-US-Puerto Rico Women's Network Against Militarism, “Gender and U.S. Bases in Asia-Pacific”, March 14, http://www.fpif.org/articles/gender_and_us_bases_in_asia-pacific)


And, despite reform efforts and policy changes, US military presence in South Korea results in a vibrant sex industry, and information on the success of policy changes has been distorted and classified

http://humantrafficking.change.org/blog/view/sex_trafficking_high_around_us_military_bases_abroad)


This perpetual machinery of military sexual exploitation is structured into the US-Korean relationship—we have total control of the military situation in Korea and shield out soldiers and military leaders from prosecution

Advantage 1: Rape 

First, military bases in Asia (specifically Korea) inherently result in rape and other forms of violence against women 
<span class="cite">Kirk 2008</span> (Gwyn, Prof Women’s Studies @ Antioch & Hamilton Universities & Founder of East Asia-US-Puerto Rico Women's Network Against Militarism, “Gender and U.S. Bases in Asia-Pacific”, March 14, http://www.fpif.org/articles/gender_and_us_bases_in_asia-pacific) 


This strategy of military basing on foreign territories is the foundation of a pervasive militarism that results in racism, sexism, sexual violence, rape, environmental destruction, and war!!! All of these impacts have our bases as their common core 
<span class="cite">Kirk, 2008</span> (Gwyn, Prof Women’s Studies @ Antioch & Hamilton Universities & Founder of East Asia-US-Puerto Rico Women's Network Against Militarism, “Gender and U.S. Bases in Asia-Pacific”, March 14, http://www.fpif.org/articles/gender_and_us_bases_in_asia-pacific)


And, rape outweighs any impacts: it’s worse than nuclear war

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Advantage 2: Patirachy </span>**
Rape is the ultimate expression of patriarchy 
<span class="cite">Cahill, 2001</span> Ann Cahill, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Rethinking Rape, Page 2, 2001


We must recognize patriarchy as the system that keeps all forms of violence alive. The impact of patriarchy outweighs all and culminates in extinction. Our plan’s confrontation of the patriarchal conceptions embedded in militarism is key to solve.

Advantage 3: Sex Trafficking 

First, Prostitution and brothels are INTEGRAL to US military bases in Korea, culminating in sexual exploitation 
<span class="cite">Enriquez, 1999</span> (Jean, Director of the Coalition Against the Trafficking of Women in the Asia Pacific, November, 


<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">“Filipinas in Prostitution around U.S. Military Bases in Korea: A Recurring Nightmare”, http://www.catw-</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">ap.org/resources/speeches-papers/filipinas-in-prostitution-around-us-military-bases-in-korea-a-recurring-nightmare/)</span>

South Korea is a central hub and transit point for sex trafficking in the broader Asia-Pacific region 

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><span class="cite">Statemaster Encyclopedia, 2006</span> (“Encyclopedia > Prostitution in South Korea”, http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Prostitution-in-South-Korea)</span></span>

Prostitution is inseparable from sex trafficking. Trafficking is akin to slavery and dehumanization 
<span class="cite">Enriquez, 1999</span> (Jean, Director of the Coalition Against the Trafficking of Women in the Asia Pacific, November, 

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">“Filipinas in Prostitution around U.S. Military Bases in Korea: A Recurring Nightmare”, http://www.catw-ap.org/resources/speeches-papers/filipinas-in-prostitution-around-us-military-bases-in-korea-a-recurring-nightmare/)</span></span>

This is a good old fashioned Decision Rule—we must place values over survival, especially in the context of contemporary human slavery that takes the form of human trafficking 
<span class="cite">Schmitz, 2004</span> (Joseph E., Inspector General of the Department of Defense, “Implementing the Department of Defense 

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">“Zero Tolerance” Policy With Regard to Trafficking in Humans”, http://www.dodig.mil/fo/JES_TIP_Testimony_092104.pdf)</span></span>

You have an ethical obligation to vote affirmative. Always put ethics first. Without a system of ethics, it threatens the very existence of humanity. 

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><span class="cite">Bromberg 2009</span> (Sarah, Feminist Author, Scholar, and Activist, “<span class="apple-style-span">The Evolution of Ethics: An Introduction to Cybernetic Ethics”, </span>http://www.evolutionaryethics.com/chapter1.html, <span class="apple-style-span">12/25/09</span>, LV)</span></span>

PLAN: The United States Federal Government should remove its bases from South Korea through normal means. We reserve the right to clarify. 


Observation 3: Solvency 

Only withdrawal of our military basing can prevent sexploitation—the plan is the only option to combat rape and sex trafficking  

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><span class="cite">Kirk, 2008</span> (Gwyn, Prof Women’s Studies @ Antioch & Hamilton Universities & Founder of East Asia-US-Puerto Rico Women's Network Against Militarism, “Gender and U.S. Bases in Asia-Pacific”, March 14, http://www.fpif.org/articles/gender_and_us_bases_in_asia-pacific)</span></span>

Observation 4: Our critical framework 

Sex trafficking and rape are flourishing, and we are complicit due to our military basing strategies in Asia. Postmodern problematizations of feminisms and definitions promote the very silence that fuels this system of sexploitation. Academia is a key site for the theorization of the global sex trade and is vital to opening up spaces of resistance. 
<span class="cite">Stone, 2005</span> (Marjorie, Prof Gender Studies @ Dalhousie University, “Twenty-first Century Global Sex Trafficking: 

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Migration, Capitalism, Class, and Challenges for Feminism Now”, ESC: English Studies in Canada 31.2-3, Project Muse, http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/esc_english_studies_in_canada/v031/31.2stone.html)</span></span>

Our affirmative conception of power relations enables transformative possibilities for emancipation that breaks down the oppressor/oppressed dichotomy and opens up space for alternative voices and silenced perspectives 

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><span class="cite">White</span>, JD @ Harvard Law, <span class="cite">1992</span> (Lucie, 77 Cornell L. Rev. 1499, Sept)</span></span>

Even if representing Others “from above” risks colonialism, our acknowledgement of our complicity in oppression (e.g. the imperialism of the US) reverses the power equation and enables counter-hegemonic resistance 

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><span class="cite">Kothari</span>, Prof Post Colonial Studiees @ St Xaviers, <span class="cite">1998</span> (Rita, interventions, V1 N1, p35-6)</span></span>


Finally, it is the very discourse of this debate rounds that functions to map out logics of domination and solve oppression and enable resistance
