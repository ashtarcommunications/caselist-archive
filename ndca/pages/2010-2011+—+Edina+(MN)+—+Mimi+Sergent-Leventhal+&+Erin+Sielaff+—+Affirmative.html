<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Even if there’s no intentional conflict, current high tensions risk accidents that escalate</strong><br />
STRATFOR, 10 (5/26/10, “North Korea, South Korea: The Military Balance on the Peninsula,” http: www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula, JMP)<br />
<br />

<br />
