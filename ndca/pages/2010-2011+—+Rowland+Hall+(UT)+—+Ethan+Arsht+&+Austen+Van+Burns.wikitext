==Afghanistan Plan -== 

Plan: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its counterinsurgency presence in Afghanistan.

OR

Plan: The Department of Defense should substantially reduce its counterinsurgency presence in Afghanistan.


==Hegemony Advantage== 

First, we’re not ahead – Counterinsurgency is impossible in Afghanistan.

Nelson, ‘9 – former director of a Joint Task Force in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, retired naval officer with assignments at the National Counterterrorism Center and National Security Council, and Senior Fellow at the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (Rick, “The Other Side of the COIN”, 10/1, http://csis.org/publication/other-side-coin)

Q1: General McChrystal is expected to request up to … expenditure that any “all-in” approach would entail.


Failure is inevitable in the status quo – Corruption, lack of resources, ethnic tensions, and geography make the strategy ineffective.

Dorronsoro, ‘10 - visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment, is an expert on Afghanistan, Turkey, and South Asia. Previously, Dorronsoro was a professor of political science at the Sorbonne, Paris and the Institute of Political Studies of Rennes (Gilles, “The Case for Negotiations,” In These Times, 5/24, http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=40863)

The coalition's strategy in Afghanistan is at an impasse … recognize the impossibility of a military solution.


The Afghan COIN model is disastrous for US hegemony – We will control 2 internals

a. Retrenchment

COIN ultimately results in abandonment – loss of leadership here will result in countless scenarios of destruction.

Kretkowski, ‘10 – Frequently assists think tank in conferences and other work products that aid DoD's long-term thinking about threats that may not be addressable via weapons platforms. Spent six months in Afghanistan working with Army public affairs. (Paul, “Against COIN, for CT in Afghanistan and Elsewhere”, 1/7, Beacon (a blog), http://softpowerbeacon.blogspot.com/2010/01/against-coin-for-ct-in-afghanistan-and.html)

Over the winter break I had an epiphany about the interrelation of … or complex challenges from a rising power (China, a reinvigorated Russia).


b. Morale & Readiness

Afghanistan is a quagmire –presence eviscerates American morale.

Kuhner, 9 - the president of the Edmund Burke Institute for American Renewal (Jeffrey, Washington Times, “Obama’s quagmire; US should look to its own interests,” 9/7, Lexis Academic)

America is losing the war in Afghanistan … Afghans into the evil, welcoming arms of extremists

Loss of primacy guarantees world wars.

Kagan 07 - senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (Robert, “End of Dreams, Return of History”, 7/19, http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/07/end_of_dreams_return_of_histor.html)

Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy … influence and global involvement will provide an easier path


The impact is extinction

Nye 90 (Joseph, University Distinguished Service Professor and Sultan of Oman Professor of International Relations at Harvard University., “Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power”, 17-18)

Perceptions of change in the relative power of nations … which two nations have dominated the balance of power.


Even if they win that a world without hegemony is good, they still lose – getting there would mean massive transition wars across the globe

Brzezinski 5 (Zbigniew National Security Advisor in the Carter Administration, Professor of Foreign Policy at Johns Hopkins University, “The Choice: Global Domination or Global Leadership”, p. 2-4)

History is a record of change, a reminder that nothing endures … enlist others in a common effort to shape a secure international environment.


Less is more – shifting to a counterterrorism strategy maintains public support allows for a smaller, but permanent presence in the region.

Stewart, ‘9 - Ryan Family Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro (9/16/09, Rory, “The Future of Afghanistan,” http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan)

The best Afghan policy would be to reduce the number of foreign troops … In Afghanistan in the long-term, less will be more.




==Government Advantage== 

The December Review set in motion a political battle between the President and his military commanders. In the status quo, Obama will cave and recommit to COIN. This cements DOD control over foreign policy and eviscerates civilian control over the military.

Joshua Foust, ‘10, military intelligence analyst who specializes in the socio-cultural dynamics of irregular warfare, has worked on open-source analysis programs for the Defense Intelligence Agency and as an analyst for Afghanistan, 11-16-2010 (“Don’t bring a knife to a gunfight… over Afghan strategy,” Need To Know—a public affairs program on PBS, November 16th, Available Online at http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/voices/don%E2%80%99t-bring-a-knife-to-a-gunfight%E2%80%A6-over-afghan-strategy/5168/, Accessed 11-18-2010)

The war in Afghanistan is at a crossroads… watching them very closely.


This usurpation of grand strategy by the military brass will have devastating consequences—military dominance of foreign policy results in tunnel vision, conflict escalation, and adventurist wars that drag the U.S. into perpetual quagmires.

Martin, editor of Obsidian Wings, The Progressive Realist, and American Footprints, ’10 (Eric holds a B.A. in Philosophy from New York University and a J.D. from Fordham University, 10-09-2010 (“If All You Have Is A Hammer…,” American Footprints—a foreign policy blog, October 9th, Available Online at http://americanfootprints.com/wp/2010/10/if-all-you-ask-is-a-hammer/, Accessed 10-19-2010)

One of the maladies plaguing … world be damned.



COIN destroys the internal working of the government and shreds foreign policy coherence

Cohen 09 (11/30, Michael, senior research fellow at the New America Foundation, New York Daily News, " Mother of all decisions: If Obama escalates in Afghanistan, he'll set back progress on other fronts", http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/11/30/2009-11-30_the_mother_of_all_decisions.html)

Sending from 30,000 to 40,000 troops … and his presidency.


Presence in Afghanistan also kills our moral legitimacy – withdrawal opens up space for diplomacy

Pascal 09 - Zachary Pascal is a member of the In These Times Board of Editors and a professor of journalism at Stanford University and is a fellow at the German Marshall Fund, “The Case For An Immediate Withdrawal From Afghanistan”,October 12, 2009, http://towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/1717/106/


For President Obama, the stakes … to problems in distant lands. 


The impact is prolif and stability—cooperation ensures rising powers are stable and prevents nuke war

Dyer, 04 - worked as a freelance journalist, columnist, broadcaster and lecturer on international affairs for more than 20 years, but he was originally trained as an historian. Born in Newfoundland, he received degrees from Canadian, American and British universities, finishing with a Ph.D. in Military and Middle Eastern History from the University of London. [Gwynne, "The end of war," Toronto Star, 12/30, l/n]


War is deeply embedded in our history… within the context of the existing state system.

==__Eurasian Relations Advantage__== 
**US-India relations are in flux but recent announcements, visits, and foreign policy changes mean improvements are coming.**
Gulshan Madhur, ’11 (1/8, “The Future of U.S.–India Relations: What is on the Menu?” Pravasi News Today, [[http://www.pravasitoday.com/the-future-of-u-s-%E2%80%93india-relations-what-is-on-the-menu]])

The recently concluded strategic dialogue between India and the US promises to clear the misconceptions … better days ahead for Indo-U.S. ties.

**Withdrawal crushes US-India relations – Afghanistan is the key test.**
Kaplan, Senior Fellow at the Center for New American Security, ’10 (Robert D, South Asia’s geography of Conflict, August, 2010)

India will emerge as the key Eurasian pivot state because of its effect on relations between … just Indian, but also Pakistani and Chinese elites, see the United States

**That solves Sino-Indo border disputes**
Bidwai ‘7 (Praful, Inter Press Service, July 6 [[http://www.tni.org/detail_page.phtml?act_id=17111]])
India's 'strategic partnership' with the US is having the predictable consequence of worsening its relationship with China.

Indian decision-makers are coming under growing … the price that India pays for courting the U.S."

**Continuing border disputes cause a nuclear war with China.**
Kahn ’9 (Jeremy, Masters Degree in IR from London School of Economics and freelance journalist based in New Delhi, 10/10, Newsweek, “Why India Fears China”, [[http://www.newsweek.com/2009/10/09/why-india-fears-china.html]])

China claims some 90,000 … China might retaliate against India.

**Indo-Pak relations are zero-sum – improvements with India cool off US aid and support to Pakistan, which causes regime collapse.**
Mirzayan, ‘10 (Gevorg, Special Foreign Affairs Correspondent, “Does US/India Strategic Alliance Leave Pakistan Out In the Cold?”, There Are No Sunglasses (Blog), 8-24, [[http://therearenosun/|http://therearenosun]] glasses.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/does-usindia-strategic-alliance-leave-pakistan-out-in-the-cold/)

According to most analysts, the information war …Central Asia will become a new Middle East.

Pakistan collapse causes nuclear war and terrorism.
Pitt, ‘9- a New York Times and internationally bestselling author of two books: "War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn't Want You to Know" and "The Greatest Sedition Is Silence." (5/8/09, William, “Unstable Pakistan Threatens the World,” [[http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=commentary&article=2183]])

As familiar as this sounds… addressing the situation. So should we all.

**Nuclear terrorism independently causes extinction.**
Morgan, ‘9 (Dennis Ray, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in South Korea, “World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race”, July 10, Futures 41 (2009) 683–693)

In a remarkable website on nuclear war, … upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well.

**PLAN: The United States federal government should eliminate its military presence in Afghanistan.**

**Observation One: A Failure of Imagination**
**1. __Hegemony__ –**
**The American military portrays itself as the “Prince of Peace.” To quote a few leading hegemony authors, American unipolarity “deters hostile rivals;” it “projects power;” “it preserve order by acting as a global policeman;” and it “creates a balance of power in world politics that ensures stability.” This goal for primacy is the final crusade for peace itself.**
**Hillman in 2004** (James, retired Director of the Jung Institute, “A Terrible Love of War”, The Penguin Press, ISBN 1-59420-011-4, pg 84)
As latecomers (twenty- five centuries or more) … __battalions go abroad "waging peace__."

**2. __Military Presence__ –**
**It’s an integral part of this war for peace and is rooted in the definition of the phrase.**
**Thomason et al 2002** (IDA Paper P-3707, “Transforming US Overseas Military Presence: Evidence and Options for DoD Volume I: Main Report” This paper has been prepared by the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) in partial fulfillment of a task being performed for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense . The task, entitled “Effects-Based Assessments of US Presence and Deployment Patterns,” is being conducted to help the DoD identify evidence of the effects that actual and potential alternative US overseas military presence postures and activities have or may have in promoting key US defense and national security strategy goals.

WHAT IS OVERSEAS MILITARY PRESENCE? __… should call for them__.2

**And, our occupation of foreign countries is a failed attempt to manage and fix global problems. In short, our aversion to war is actually producing it.**
Thomas **Moore in 1990** (Thomas Moore is the author of the bestselling book Care of the Soul and fifteen other books. He has Ph. D. in religion from Syracuse University and has won several awards for his work, including an honorary doctorate from Lesley University. //The essential James Hillman: a blue fire//, Routledge; 1 edition, 1-3)
Because of its family ties to medicine, __… in our symptoms is our soul.__

**3. __Sanitation__ –**
**Our presence in Afghanistan is the logical extreme of this aversion. Drones sanitize war and remove operators from the massive amounts of damage done**
**Payne, ‘9** (Michael, American Foreign Policy Specialist for Online Journal and the Information Clearing House, “Deadly Drones: Immoral Weapons of Civilian Destruction,” October 23, 2009, [[http://www.opednews.com/articles/Deadly-drones-immoral-wea-by-michael-payne-091021-444.html]])
__I call the drones being used in Afghanistan … what America has become?__
**And, Counterinsurgency attempts to win the hearts of minds of Afghan civilians and our soldiers are made to see themselves as heroes crusading against the evil Taliban. This sanitized understanding of war brainwashes us, the civil soldiers, so we forget what war really is – war in the name of peace is the ultimate psychological delusion.**
**Hillman 04** (James, retired Director of the Jung Institute, “A Terrible Love of War”, The Penguin Press, ISBN 1-59420-011-4, pgs 90-92)
Why dwell on this archaic …__the mind would be enough.__

**4. __Obama__**
**Declared the anti-war president, Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace prize for his vision of disarmament and love. Yet, every year, more drone strikes happen under his administration than the entire Bush presidency. This amplification of violence in Afghanistan is the underbelly of our pursuit of peace.**
**Hillman 04** (James, retired Director of the Jung Institute, “A Terrible Love of War”, The Penguin Press, ISBN 1-59420-011-4, pgs 30-31)

**Observation Two – The Role of the Ballot**

**The psyche exists and comes first – it shapes our understanding of the world – everything depends on it. The resolution should only be evaluated on its psychological qualities.**
**Jung 06** (Carl G., renowned scholar of psychoanalysis and founder of the Jung Institute, __The Undiscovered Self__, New American Library, New York, 81-83)
__For more than fifty years we have known__… __can happen to everyone.__

**Refusing to operate on the terrain of the psyche ensures a loss of soul. This state of dehumanization destroys any meaning to life and risks death.**

Anthropologists describe a condition among "primitive" … __in search of a soul__."

**Our 1AC is solvent – Military presence is the primary psychological task that shapes all of our notions about society. Unless we come to terms with the war in each of us, our desire for war will lash out and push us closer and closer to annihilation.**
**Hillman 04** (James, retired Director of the Jung Institute, “A Terrible Love of War”, The Penguin Press, ISBN 1-59420-011-4, pgs 1-3)
__One sentence in one scene from …__ is the purpose of this book.

**The negative will attempt to map out the topic and psychologically attempt to silence the soul within the topic by trying to empiricize and literalize it, and looking at implementation. In contrast we offer the plan of archetypal psychology: to explore our deep psychological commitments and affirm our most terrorizing images of the world, namely the topic of military presence.**
