Observation 1: Justice requires due process for punishment, it is a key protection. Davis writes,
Davis writes<span style="font-size: 12pt;">,</span> (David Davis, Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court, EX PARTE MILLIGAN (Citation: 71 U.S. 2), 1866, www.findlaw.com, Access date: Sept 7, 2011 p. O.G.)-Card edited for gendered and anthropocentric language-

The power of.. contest of ages.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">Further, issues of due process come prior to normative questions of desirability because of the nature of justice.</span>

And, There is no morally relevant distinction between human animals and non-human animals in terms of due process. Social interaction and the implied rules that result are not unique human experiences. Gruen Explains,
Gruen, 10 (Lori Gruen – 2010 [Professor of Philosophy, Wesleyan University] The Moral Status of Animals, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, The Metaphysics Research Lab. GW)

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">But which capacities… moral status of animals.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">Perfect solvency not a requisite obligation for rights in a justice system.</span>
Observation 2: The affirmative advocacy is that all animals, regardless of species be granted access to due process rights when being punished of a crime. I reserve the right to clarify in CX.

Contention 1: In the status quo, trials for non-human animals are anomalies. Instead, the norm for punishment is a silent execution often obfuscated with the rhetoric of humane “euthanization”. No legal obligation exists to report the use of capital punishment on non-human animals. Girgen 03 Explains,
Girgen, 03 explains (Jen Girgen, “the historical and contemporary prosecution and punishment of animals”, http://www.animallaw.info/journals/jo_pdf/lralvol9_p97.pdf 12-may-2003, date accessed sept 6th, 2011 O.G.) 
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">The cases of… cruelty to animals.</span>
And, Executions of non-human animals are all too often carried out in vengeance or in a symbolic act of anthropocentric hierarchy creation. Due process rights are a necessary check against systemic slaughter of potentially innocent organisms. Girgen 2 Explains,
Girgen, 2 writes (Jen Girgen, “the historical and contemporary prosecution and punishment of animals”, http://www.animallaw.info/journals/jo_pdf/lralvol9_p97.pdf 12-may-2003, date accessed sept 6th, 2011 O.G.)
In at least… achieve these ends.

Contention 2: The affirmative advocacy is key. Status as legal persons is a pre-requisite to solving for legal harms. Kniaz Explains,
Kniaz, 95 (Laura G. Kniaz, J.D., University at Buffalo, Copyright (c) 1995 Buffalo Law Review (: Animal Liberation and the Law: Animals Board the Underground Railroad) 1995 (lexis))
Rights should be… a legal representative.

And, Due process rights are the most relevant rights to non-human animals, due process demands the recognition of rights before punishment occur. Dunayer Explains, 
Dunayer, 04 (Joan Dunayer, Animal Rights Activist, 2004, Speciesism, p. 140)
Amendment 5 and 14… life, liberty, or property.

And, Legal rights protect the individual from the interests of the greater society. These rights are not subject to be weighed and denied. This is not exclusive to human animals. Rollin Explains,
Rollin, 94 (Bernard E. Rollin, professor of philosophy, Colorado State University, 1994, The Great Ape Project: equality beyond humanity, eds. Cavalieri & Singer, p. 208)
In our democratic… force of law.

And, The speciesist mindset of denying animals rights perpetuates the genocide of animals across the globe. Davis Explains,
Davis, Karen CHICKEN-HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS: FROM PROCRUSTEAN GENOCIDE TO EMPATHIC ANTHROPOMORPHISM (Ph.D., the president and founder of United Poultry Concerns, p. 256-258
Forcing animals, “stretching” … is one example.

A) The Link- Extending rights to animals fabricates us/them dichotomies and results in anthropocentric oppression. The “we” of the affirmative case is implied to be defined by the commonality of human experience and the ties that creates. Weston Explains
Weston writes (Anthony Weston, Postmodern Environmental ethics, 1995, ed. Max Oelschlaeger)

I begin by… ...involving other species

And, The aff’s suffering claims are a projection of human emotion and trait on non-human animals. It is rooted in anthropocentrist speciesm. Horton Explains,

Feminists also have… …of her husband

And, This privileged political position creates an us/them dichotomy and justifies genocide against those that are seen as an other. Hoffman Explains,
Hoffmann 7 (Kasper, International Development Studies at Roskilde University, May, “Militarised Bodies and Spirits of Resistance,” http://diggy.ruc.dk:8080/bitstream/1800/2766/4/z2.pdf, p 29-30 AD: 6/1/09)

Biopower signals a… …of their contradictions

C) Alternative- Vote Neg to reject these false positions of power and engage in our criticism; only by doing so can we critically evaluate the aff’s assumptions and reconceptualize the aff’s violent discourse. Alcoff Explains,
Alcoff 92. Linda Martín Alcoff (Department of Philosophy at Syracuse University. “The Problem of Speaking For Others” Cultural Critique Winter 1991-92, pp. 5-32.)

The impetus to… …is called for

D) Framework- Discourse shapes the role of the subject and the object jointly; both nation-states and specific policies are contextualized in terms of the constitutive discourses around them. This means that discursive evaluation is both inherently political and necessary to the analysis of political impacts. Campbell Explains<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Grant/Dropbox/Oliver-Grant/Animal%20Rights/Ongoing%20Casework/Blocks/Rights%20K%20Disclosure.docx#_ftn1|[1]]]</span>,
