<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">For the past 60 years</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, since roughly the outbreak of the Korean War and the U.S. response to that war, the Navy has had a consistent strategy for the structure, deployment, and posturing of the fleet. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">American maritime dominance has been based on forces that were deployed forward and always ready to respond quickly to emerging situations</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>in areas of vital interest to American foreign policy</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Because of the perceived need to be able to respond at the highest levels of warfare throughout the Cold War, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">those forces were built, trained, and equipped to</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> be “combat credible” against capable challengers. “Combat credible” meant the ability to </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">project power against advanced air defenses, conduct and enable littoral/amphibious operations in opposed environments, and establish blue-water dominance against highly capable surface, sub-surface, and air threats</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In the post-Cold War environment, and since 9/11, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">evidence illustrates that the demand signal for naval forces has not waned</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In fact, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the Navy continues to be tasked with a range of operations, from disaster response to peacetime engagement and shows of force, and from counter-piracy and maritime interdiction to participation in major combat operations</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> by TACAIR and other power-projection forces. This demand signal did not go down during the 1990s (“reaping the peace dividend”) as the Navy took on persistent operations in the Balkans, the Caribbean, and the Arabian Gulf after Desert Storm, continued its role in Asia, and expanded its peacetime engagement as COCOMs increased “shaping” activities. After 9/11, the Navy shed its role in the Balkans and the Caribbean but increased its homeland defense role and its ballistic missile defense missions, and it has played a major part in strike operations for OIF and OEF for the past decade. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The Navy also picked up significant roles in humanitarian assistance, maritime partnership building, littoral combat, and special operational forces (SOF), and routinely had over 10,000 sailors ashore in CENTCOM to support operations there. If the Navy hoped that reductions in the demand signal would give it breathing room to reset the force and invest in platforms and assets at the expense of operations, its hopes have proved to be false. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The Navy</span> battle force <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has shrunk by 20 percent</span> in the last decade, while the number of ships on deployment has remained relatively steady. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In a period of constant demand, resources</span> to meet those demands, pay for needed future structure, and meet growing demands for spending on people and health care <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have shrunk</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">They will not grow in the future</span>. There is a gap that must be addressed</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. We defined the “global navy” as one that is dominant, ready, and influential. We accept these characteristics as proposed by the CNO and others throughout history as the appropriate language. We base our definitions on these terms and then compare them with attributes of past “global navies,” to see whether they are adequate. Our list of such navies includes Portugal, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, at the heights of their power. A dominant naval force must be compared to its potential adversaries and challengers. For centuries, this meant the capability to exert sea control when and where needed, to sustain operations in these areas indefinitely, to support and influence operations on land, and to ensure freedom of movement for a nation’s forces. To these long-standing definitions of dominance, the U.S. Navy has added the capability to do high-performance TACAIR, high-tempo submarine operations, large-scale amphibious operations, power projection from the sea with precision strike (TACAIR, TLAMs), and joint and combined operations. These numbers of assets reveal dominance in capacity, but they do not paint the whole picture. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The Navy’s dominance has been cemented by its continuing operations and training in a range of capabilities that are unmatched by any potential challengers. The Navy has been able to translate this capacity into credible maritime combat power that has the following characteristics: strategic and tactical mobility; kinetic and non-kinetic options for the use of forces to influence events ashore and at sea; tailorable packages of forces that are sustainable at sea for long periods of time, support and enable amphibious operations; assured access and protection for maritime and joint forces; and command and control of international maritime coalitions across a spectrum of operations</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> [1]. The global navy is deployed as a present force. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The issue recently has been the ability of the Navy to maintain its ready posture in the face of declining numbers. Despite an 18 percent decrease in the size of the total battle force over the last 10 years, the percentage of the fleet deployed and the number of ships deployed have remained stable</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Is this sustainable into the future? The Navy has maintained this deployment rate with a smaller fleet by changing the Fleet Response Plan (FRP) and the PERSTEMPO regulations, which has allowed for longer, more frequent deployments and doubling the percentage of the fleet assigned to the Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF) since 1998. We also note that over this time period, the number of ships training and exercising outside of CONUS has decreased from around 70 ships in 1998 to around 20 ships today. The number of ships forward is remaining constant, but the number of ships training is decreasing. A global navy is a ready navy. Both its deployed and surge forces are trained, manned, and equipped adequately. They are deployed globally so they can be ready to quickly respond to crises. They also have the capacity to flex forces from other global deployments to areas of instability and to serve as a “home fleet” that can surge for major operations. CNA’s study of the Navy as a flexible force and ready responder is well documented in previous CNA publications [2]. The trends toward more joint and combined responses have not diminished since 9/11. Responses have become routine for “shows of force” to deter and reassure or to “express U.S. interest and resolve.” Naval forces have also become routine humanitarian assistance/disaster response (HA/DR) responders because they are already deployed and ready. A global navy is influential. It exerts coalition leadership in peacetime and in war. It provides a framework for allied operations. It is a visible force for reassuring allies and partners that the government at home is committed to them and that it has resolved to place its military forces in harm’s way in support of those allies. It is a force flexible enough to provide that influence at any point in the range of operations, from a show of force to deter a regional threat to the imposition of a blockade, or the use of naval power to project force and dominate an adversary. It is influential because it can deter and reassure [3]. Maritime forces are uniquely qualified as hybrid forces. They are trained, equipped, and deployed as multi-mission platforms, capable of high-end war fighting performance. They know that when they deploy they are not likely to engage in major combat operations, but they are trained and equipped to that level. This means they can flex to that level, control escalation to that level, and be a ready force to deter potential aggression to that level. In reality, they will likely perform a range of lower-end operations and shows of force or maritime security operations and engagement activities that can be performed by the same assets. In addition, they are manned and led by personnel who have a wealth of experience and “training by doing” for these lower-end missions. The Navy performs these missions routinely, to reassure allies, engage new partners, and serve as tangible expressions of American interests and ongoing relationships in creating maritime security on a global level. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Maritime forces have advantages over land and air forces in these areas because of their inherent flexibility, their visibility without heavy footprints on land, their self-sustainability, and their routine interactions with other maritime forces</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. (Being at sea and interacting with other nations in port visits, merchant interactions, and diplomacy is what navies have been doing for centuries.) This capacity is important because of the global commitments of the government. A global navy is a tool of a global power interested in political stability and economic activity across the globe. Its political and economic commitments are expressed in treaties and partnerships with other governments on several continents, and the navy is a visible sign of the government’s willingness to maintain a global presence. Does a study of past navies alter or add to our definition of the “global navy”? Portugal, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom all developed naval forces that had “global reach” over challengers. Their challengers were focused on land conquests and regional power, while these nations built forces with global capabilities (long-range ships with sustainment and access). Their forces led the way in innovation of new platforms, materials, weapons, and operational thinking (caravels, fluyts, dreadnoughts). They also commanded more than 50 percent of the capital ships of their time (CVNs, big deck amphibs, TLAM shooters, SSNs, and SSBNs). These were dominant navies, capable of winning battles from the West Indies to the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean. The forces flexed from one theater to the next, were supported by sophisticated logistics networks and access agreements, and controlled the ladders of escalation from gunboat diplomacy to blockades, up to major naval actions that influenced the outcome of global wars involving land and sea forces [4]. These forces, in times of peace, secured the global commons and ensured freedom of movement of goods and people across the globe. They supported global trading systems from the age of mercantilism to the industrial revolution and into the modern era of capitalism. They were a gold standard for international exchange. These forces supported national governments that had specific global agendas for liberal trade, the rule of law at sea, and the protection of maritime commerce from illicit activities such as piracy and smuggling. All of these global navies supported their governments’ diplomacy and reinforced global partnerships and coalition leadership. In peacetime they engaged with local powers in India and the Far East. Their officers conducted trade talks from the North and Baltic seas to the Middle East. They carried ambassadors and merchants to weave political and economic networks that sustained global empires. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">U.S. naval forces have been postured globally as combat credible and forward present for the past 60 years. It has operated from the premise that forward presence and combat credibility provide maritime dominance</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Forward presence makes the Navy the ready responder to emerging situations and crises. The Navy, with 30 to 40 percent of its ships deployed on a routine basis, is already at sea as part of its normal operations. Presence is visibility: it means that U.S. interests are already signaled and that allies and other interested nations are aware of U.S. interests and commitments. Without presence, the ability to influence events and situations is greatly reduced. The options and range of responses available to the U.S. government are enhanced by the operational capabilities of naval forces. The combat credibility of U.S. naval forces has been a consistent factor of U.S. naval strategy for this period as well. Combat-credible forces are capable of a range of operations from shows of force to humanitarian assistance, up to the use of tactical air forces and missiles for precision attacks or as part of a large joint operation. Combat credibility for this entire period has been defined by the presence of carrier strike groups (carriers and their highly capable escorts of cruisers and destroyers), by amphibious forces able to influence events ashore, and by the ability to concentrate submarine forces for a range of missions from intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) to sea control. All of these forces have been supported by afloat logistics ships and a network of overseas bases and access agreements that have allowed such forces to be sustained indefinitely, as responses have turned into persistent missions. This global naval power has been exercised on the same scale as that practiced by previous naval powers (relative to historical time and means available). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The Navy has defined its global presence as sustaining combat credibility in two hubs</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (WESTPAC and the Mediterranean throughout the Cold War and </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">WESTPAC and the</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> North Arabian Sea/</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Arabian Gulf</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> since Desert Storm). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The Navy has maintained this presence in response to the consistent demands of many administrations for U.S. military presence by joint forces. Forces in these areas reflect long-standing U.S. political and economic interests, reassurance of allies, and deterrence of threats to regional stability</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In addition, the Navy has maintained the capacity and flexibility to surge additional forces from CONUS and other parts of the globe for emerging conflicts and crises</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. It also had the capacity for short-term surges and engagement activities by independent deployers in other parts of the world. These independent deployers took part in routine exercises with partners and allies from Latin America to Europe and Asia. They accompanied hospital ships on humanitarian assistance missions and responded themselves to natural disasters. They went on engagement and training missions such as the African Partnership Station or Southern Partnership Station. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The size of the Navy has ranged</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>from fewer than 300 ships to more than 1,000 ships,1 <strong>but</strong> <strong>the forward presence and combat credibility parts of the Navy’s strategy for global preeminence have never changed</strong></u> <u>To be forward is to be ready, and to be combat credible is to be dominant and able to control escalation and de-escalation at any level of confrontation</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The global reach and ambitions of the Navy also have never changed; to be absent is to forgo influence. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The world system in which the USN will operate is evolving</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>along three dimensions at once</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">First, <strong>the system is seeing the emergence of some strong <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">states</span> that can and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">intend to challenge the</span> traditional <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">global order</span></strong> on certain economic issues and regional security issues. <strong>In Asia, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">China</span> asserts more influence</strong> over regional issues</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> from Korea around to the South China Sea. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In the Middle East</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> and Persian Gulf region, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Iran</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> is an opportunistic regional power</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>threatening Western-aligned states and Western interests</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Russia, humiliated for a decade, has a more nationalistic and defensive foreign policy in the territory of the former Soviet Union. In this environment, the coordination of Western allied responses has been more difficult. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Second, <strong>there are elements of a chaotic future</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> in the area loosely defined by Tom Barnett’s “Gap” as outlined in his book, The Pentagon’s New Map (from Indonesia to South Asia and the Middle East, and on through most of Africa) [5], </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">especially in the region <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">from Morocco to Pakistan</span>, where terrorism and</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>Islamic <strong>radicalism continue to threaten U.S. interests and global stability</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The “long war” against Islamic radical terror looks like it will continue for years. Poorly governed areas and weak states will continue to allow groups that threaten local and regional security to survive. As long as there are groups that equate globalization and modern life with the triumph of the U.S., the threat of chaos from these groups will continue as they seek to turn back the tide. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">At the same time, part of the world is creating greater cooperative solutions to problems</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This is characterized by the extension and strengthening of the democratic community of states, the continued management of the global economy without major crises by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) states through legitimized multilateral organizations, the absence of major regional conflicts between states, the limitation of third-world conflicts with minimal impact on regional stability, and the continued role of the U.S. as a global military power without parallel. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In this evolving world, the U.S. government expects the U.S. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Navy</span> to exert maritime dominance on demand.

The Navy will be the framework provider for regional coordination and partnerships, and naval cooperation will be part of integrated engagement processes involving whole-of government approaches. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Within these broad global objectives, <strong>the Navy’s responses <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will be constrained by</span></strong> a set of external and internal factors</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, which we turn to now. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The gap between the demands to respond to everything and the maritime resources to meet those demands</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>is created by these external and internal factors</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Within the United States, the Navy’s options are framed by a number of issues that will remain constant throughout the foreseeable future. These constraints stem from political and economic realities, from the level of the federal budget, and from previous force structure decisions that have created the legacy fleet of today. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>first and <strong>largest constraint is the future of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the federal budget</span>, highlighted by expanding social spending, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">high deficits, and the need to rein in</span></strong> all discretionary spending</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (</span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">military spending</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>included</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, especially as Iraq winds down and Afghanistan continues). This means that Navy budgets will not experience growth above the rates of inflation. Within that broad limit, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the Navy will find that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the downward pressure on ship numbers will be serious</span>, as the top number must encompass ongoing operations, rising service costs for health care and personnel, and increasing demands for ships with multiple mission capabilities</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (as numbers decrease, each ship must be expected to do more). The result is a future Navy that will reflect past investment decisions on CVNs, Virginia-class SSNs, LPD17s, Aegis platforms, and littoral combat ships (LCSs). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The ability to rapidly create a force structure is also hampered because <strong>the lower budgets mean a shrinking industrial base</strong> to support a larger fleet</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Within the DoD budget, the Service shares will remain unchanged. Since Vietnam, these shares have been consistent. They have not varied more than 1 percent, except for times of major combat operations. At those times, more money has been channeled to the land forces engaged and for their reset after the fight. We assume that those shares will continue into the future and that the Navy cannot increase its force structure or operating budgets by prevailing over the other Services in the annual budget battles or the Quadrennial DefenseReview/Quadrennial Roles and Missions (QDR/QRM) processes. The fleet will be called on to respond to situations, and its responses will be increasingly joint and combined. Navy TACAIR will be intricately linked with USAF access, tanking, and support. Joint ISR processes and space assets will be a part of maritime operations. The Navy will enable amphibious operations and SOF operations on a range of contingencies, and Navy strike and BMD operations will take place as part of coordinated campaigns involving all of the Services. At the other end of the spectrum, the Navy will conduct low-end and peacetime operations with partners who exhibit a range of capabilities that the Navy must adapt to, and it will have to be interoperable with non-DoD organizations to have maximum effect for these operations. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In the future, the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">demand for the Navy will continue</span> to be part of an activist US foreign policy. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">There is no end in sight for</span> coalition <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">leadership, counter-terrorism</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>on a global scale, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">or</span> the use of U.S. forces to demonstrate commitment and resolve</strong> in areas of interest</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The importance of access secured by continuous Department of Defense and Department of State efforts with partners will support this global presence. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">U.S. interests in securing the global commons (sea, air, space, cyber) will remain in place, and the U.S. will remain the guarantor of security for democratic nations through its near monopoly on high-end military power and defensive systems. Continued demand for active peacetime engagement by the U.S. military will be met by maritime diplomacy to support administration priorities and to support security cooperation activities by COCOMs</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The Navy’s future options face a number of external constraints. These will shape the choices the Navy makes with regard to force structure, deployment patterns, operational priorities, and posture</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">First, <strong>there will be a continued demand for <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a safe</span> and secure <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">global maritime environment</span></strong>. <strong>Advantages to having an open world economy and trade for all major powers are growing</strong>, and for the first time in the era of modern nation-states, no major power seeks to disrupt the open world economic system. <strong>All</strong> of the <strong>states want access to the global maritime commons for shipping</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Increasingly, nations are trying to formulate a set of maritime rules to support local/regional development and maritime policing of illicit activities. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Second, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">no other</span> country (or combination of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">countries</span>) <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will create the forces required</span> for a navy with global influence. America’s European allies, and its Asian allies</strong> as well, <strong>have created navies that are capable of sustained regional operations</strong>, or routine “cruising” by small squadrons of surface ships that show the flag, conduct engagement and exercises, and demonstrate national interest in economic ties with the visited nations and regions. These navies can also conduct short-term surges for uses of force against low end threats or act as supporters to USN-led naval operations; <strong>however <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">persistent</span> out-of-area <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">operations</span> (even by a low number of assets) <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would quickly deplete their resources and political support</span> at home</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Third, China’s economic growth will continue to underwrite military/naval modernization and increases in capacity</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. China is behaving exactly as every growing nation has behaved since the dawn of the Maritime Age in the 1400s. Countries with growing economies and greater political power have translated this into larger and more modern navies as a sign of their power and intent to play a prominent role in global politics. China’s current aspirations in the first island chain will very likely expand to include all of WESTPAC and greater involvement along its maritime trade and energy routes from the Arabian Gulf to the Indian Ocean and back through the South China Sea. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Fourth, the stability of WESTPAC and the area around the Arabian Gulf will continue to be cornerstones of global stability and of vital interest to the security of the U</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates. Economic activity in WESTPAC (trade statistics, shipping, largest ports, economic growth, export-oriented economies, need for job creation, dependence on resource flows) now accounts for most of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). The United States remains the guarantor of regional stability for its allies (Japan, South Korea, and Australia) and is engaged in developing relationships with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries eager to balance a growing Chinese power. On the other side of the Straits of Malacca, the U.S. and India are engaged in greater cooperation and coordination on economic, political, and military aspects of the relationship. In the Arabian Gulf AOR, the U.S. interests will remain paramount for years. It is still the source of global oil and natural gas resources and reserves for America, its allies, and its adversaries. It is at the geographic center for radical Islamic terrorists and state sponsors who aim to attack the U.S. and its allies. It is the potential ground for WMD proliferation if Iran continues its nuclear program and Arab regional actors reply. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In this environment, U.S. allies will continue to demand visible and credible signs of U.S. commitment to regional stability. In both areas, there will likely be an increasing ballistic missile threat, which will best be addressed by robust naval BMD assets</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">In Chapter 1, this paper mainly analyzes two major approaches driving U.S. China policy. Although there is a debate over what is the best combination of hedging and engagement elements in this policy, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">most</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>U.S. <strong>policy makers agree</strong> that <strong>the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt; padding: 0in;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">should maintain a strong military commitment to Asia to better hedge</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> or engage </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">a rising <strong>China</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The next major question is to gauge the long-term U.S. capability to carry out its intentions. <strong>If this capability weakens</strong> in the foreseeable future, <strong>options for U.S.-China strategy, as well as Japan-China policy, may be constricted</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. For the United States to maintain a strong commitment to Asia, at least two kinds of resources will be required. The first is physical resources, such as the defense budget and military forces. The second is political support to sustain such a commitment. In other words, the U.S. government needs to ensure strong public support in order to continuously pay the costs and take the risks necessary to maintain a strong military presence in Asia. Constraints to Physical Resources Even with military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, current U.S. defense spending is relatively small in terms of its share of the gross domestic product (GDP). During the Korean (1953) and Vietnam (1968) conflicts, total defense spending was some 14.2 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, of the GDP; in 2007, this figure is likely to be only about 4.5 percent.54 In this respect, the burden of defense spending on the U.S. economy as a whole is not so great as in the past. Some supporters of heavy defense outlays, therefore, insist that the United States can afford more in this regard. The trend over the past few years, however, is not indicating such an optimistic prospect. From FY 2000 to 2006, the regular “non-war” defense budget rose by about 22 percent after inflation.55 This increase, which does not include funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, pushed the level of defense spending above the peacetime average during the Cold War.56 Unclear prospects in the two present conflicts are also a heavy burden for federal spending. More importantly, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">pressures to reduce the federal budget deficit will be constraints on defense spending</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. According to a prediction by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the federal budget deficit will increase to more than $2 trillion over the next decade, even under optimistic projections.57 In order to tackle this serious deficit issue, in February 2007, the Bush Administration announced its intention to reduce the budget deficit very drastically starting in FY 2008 and to bring the budget into the black by FY 2012. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Within the budget, mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare are likely to increase constantly, as the baby boomers reach full retirement age starting around 2010. Therefore, pressure on defense spending will increase, leaving less room for further drastic expansion. The structure of defense spending is also showing some constraints. Operation and maintenance spending is rising constantly due to the pressure to improve the quality of life in the military, and this trend will likely continue</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Since the Korean War, this expenditure per troop has increased at a yearly average of 2.6 percent above inflation.58 Even if the U.S. government ensures a certain growth of defense spending every year, the increase of these fixed costs may offset it. For example, the FY 2006 defense budget request was $131 billion more than that in FY 2000, but $77 billion (almost 60 percent) of this was in the “Military Personnel” and “Operation and Maintenance” accounts.59 Increases of these spending items are not directly linked to the QDR’s plan to expand naval forces in the Asia-Pacific, which is mainly aimed at better hedging against China’s military expansion. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Whether the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt; padding: 0in;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">can maintain a strong military commitment to</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Asia</span>-Pacific <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will</span> largely <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">depend upon the future posture of</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>the <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">naval</span></strong> and air <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">forces</span></strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In February 2006, in order to execute the QDR plan, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the U.S. Navy outlined a requirement for a fleet of 313 ships, which included 11 aircraft carriers</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, 66 submarines, and 62 guided missile destroyers. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Yet, <strong>in addition to federal budget constraints, the rising cost of shipbuilding makes this</strong> plan more <strong>difficult</strong> for the U.S. military to afford. It is widely believed that the Navy’s budget projections for shipbuilding associated with the 313-ship fleet plan largely underestimate the sharp rise in the costs of shipbuilding in recent years</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.60 In short, although the Bush Administration has the clear intention to strengthen the U.S. military commitment to the Asia-Pacific region, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">there is</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">serious danger that the U.S. military cannot ensure the</span> necessary <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">funding to execute its defense plan</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">There is a significant gap</span> between the resources that the U.S. military requires and what is actually available</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.</span></span><br />

What does this navy look like? </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">This navy would be based on proportional cuts in CVNs, LCSs, amphibs, Aegis platforms, and SSNs as the service strives to maintain the “balanced fleet.</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">” An FDNF would be retained in WESTPAC because of the vast legacy costs already spent there, but the FDNF would not be as robust as it is now, with a CSG at its core and a number of BMD assets, but with reduced numbers of other strike and power projection forces. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">As the fleet shrinks, the capacity to cover</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>the Arabian Gulf and <strong>its environs with <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">constant <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">CSG presence</span> will be lost</span></strong>. In addition, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">there would be reduced capacity for surging forces</span></strong> from CONUS <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">because reductions in operations and maintenance would impact readiness</span></strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The “bathtub” for returning deployers would get longer and deeper for a smaller number of high end forces. The navy would rely more on war games and simulations for the training of its forces as budget constraints cut into steaming days and flying hours. 2. How does this navy create a “global effect”? A global navy of 230 ships would retain some level of visible forward presence force in WESTPAC to maintain influence with regional allies (Japan, Korea, Australia). In other areas of the globe, the navy could conduct routine “cruises” with low-end assets to engage low end navies for maritime security operations (MSO) and demonstrate commitment to regional stability. It could also conduct routine “cruises” of limited duration with high-end assets to work with allies/partners to demonstrate commitment and reassurance in the CENTCOM AOR, or other emerging threat areas. Reduced amphibious forces would be able to project adequate power ashore for the most probable range of low-end contingencies. It is likely that the Navy would still be the largest and most technologically advanced fleet, but it would be relatively less dominant as a unilateral force, with less capability to influence events ashore at multiple points around the world at any time. 3. What assumptions are made in creating this force? For the Navy to proceed down this path, it must make a set of assumptions about internal politics inside DoD and the government. It must also make another set of assumptions about the evolving world political system. The first is that maintaining a balanced fleet is a top priority and that symmetric cuts across the board can keep such a fleet and meet budget constraints. This would be founded on an assessment of the politics within DoD and the Congress, and the executive order that the Navy is politically constrained from making large changes in fleet direction and structure and strategy. Second, in the aftermath of Iraq, the government would be reluctant to carry out large-scale military operations in the CENTCOM AOR. This would lead to a reduced demand for combat-credible forward forces in the Arabian Gulf region for contingency and OPLAN execution. The U.S. would rely on its reputation in past uses of force to deter future regional aggression. This reduced demand is predicated on the assessment that there would be a lower threat from Iran, or a similar rogue nation, and Islamic terrorist activity. Maritime security operations (e.g., piracy) would continue to be handled by coalition actions involving a modest level of U.S. forces. On the other side of the world, WESTPAC demands could be addressed by the FDNF, with a regular backfill when necessary to maintain a 1.0 presence. This would be based on an assumption that PRC maritime capabilities and operations advance slowly, with more resources directed to internal developments and social programs than to an increasing military presence financed by double-digit military budget increases. The navy would be able to continue its global posture with the support of USAF forward basing and access. In addition, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">BMD demand would be limited to meeting a threat from only two rogue nations, with a limited capability that could be addressed by planned Aegis-fleet numbers</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The navy would require</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> greater strategic and operational coordination with allies and partners on cruises for training and engagement with low-end navies to maximize shared interests and effectiveness. It would also require </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">continued access to sustainment for cruising in-theater, with less reliance on organic logistics assets as the fleet shrinks and such assets are concentrated on the vast reaches of the Western Pacific</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. 4. What risks are involved in creating this force? </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The inevitable conclusion</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> of this process <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is that <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">the shrinking status quo Navy will do all things, but none of them very well</span></span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (“managing” at 2/3 speed and hoping there are no shocks to the system). </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The steady slide down</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> the slope <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could easily erode <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">combat credibility</span></span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>(“hollowing out of the fleet”) <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and lead to <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">less reassurance of allies</span> in WESTPAC and</span> other places <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">around the world</span></strong>, over time. The allies outside of WESTPAC would lose the visible and combat-credible presence to deter threats in CENTCOM. In addition, the Navy runs the risk of looking just like other navies in that region, and elsewhere, most of the time. Except for scheduled cruises of CSGs for specific times and missions, the forces of the United States would be indistinguishable from other navies</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Is that enough to deter? The answer to that question is subject to debate, and the navy would have to team with other navies while waiting for the arrival of dominant forces from CONUS. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Reduced operations for returning deployers and surge forces risk reducing surge responsiveness, as well as the capability to conduct highend operations at the levels of safety and effectiveness that have characterized current naval operations</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. If the missions were to become persistent, reductions in organic logistics could reduce sustainability, especially if local access and support were tenuous. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">At the end of the day, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the</span> risk is that a <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Navy</span> 20 percent smaller than today’s <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will lose</span> its flexibility to have <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">escalation dominance</span> in major combat operations to decisively influence events ashore.</span></u></strong> <u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Is there a logical “tipping point” that can be numerically assigned?</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> Is a 285 ship-Navy the tipping point, or is it at 250, or 230? At what number, does the Navy reach a point where it is no longer able to project combat credibility with constant forward presence? Is the Navy able to deter and reassure at 230 ships? It depends.</span></span><br />

In 2009, he ended production of the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, scaled back missile defense, retired scores of warplanes and put on hold the planning on a long-range nuclear bomber — systems associated with a clash of titans, not counterinsurgency. &quot;We want to look ahead to the years ahead and make sure that we're not creating something or imaging something or embarking on something that we're not going to be able to pay for,&quot; <span style="color: black;">Ash Carter</span>, the <span style="color: black;">Pentagon</span>'s top acquisition officer, told reporters. &quot;If we want to continue to invest in war-fighter capabilities, we're going to have to do that by finding efficiencies and being leaner.&quot; </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">At a time when the</span></u> <span style="color: black; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";">Congressional Budget Office</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">is warning that the mounting</span></u> <span style="color: black; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";">U.S.</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">debt is not sustainable,</span></u> <span style="color: black; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";">Mr. Gates</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">has given his team the daunting task of finding $100 billion in savings over five years</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, starting in fiscal 2012, the budget that goes to <span style="color: black;">Congress</span> next winter. The aim is to keep overall defense spending of about $700 billion at a 1 percent, after-inflation, increase annually. &quot;What he's moving on to now is getting efficiencies out of the system by cutting overhead costs,&quot; said <span style="color: black;">Loren Thompson</span>, who runs the pro-business <span style="color: black;">Lexington Institute</span>. &quot;They're going to achieve that by seeking greater productivity from contractors, by reducing unnecessary rules and regulations, and by tightening contract terms. My guess is that at the same time they are doing that they will cut additional weapons systems.&quot; <span style="color: black;">Mr. Thompson</span> said that on the day he spoke with <span style="color: black;">The Washington Times</span> that <span style="color: black;">Pentagon</span> officials were meeting over the fate of the <span style="color: black;">Marine Corps</span>' $13 billion Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle. The <span style="color: black;">Corps</span> has said the system is critical for Marines in future wars. But <span style="color: black;">Mr. Gates</span> has suggested that the vehicle is expendable in a war-fighting era when full amphibious assaults are unlikely. &quot;I think <span style="color: black;">Gates</span>' efforts to cut spending are necessary,&quot; said <span style="color: black;">Mr. Thompson</span>. &quot;I can quibble about how they're doing it. But we've got a government that's spending $4 billion a day it doesn't have. The <span style="color: black;">Pentagon</span> just wastes a huge amount of money.&quot; As <span style="color: black;">Mr. Gates</span> was planning to shift money from big future wars to current smaller ones, some conservatives noted an inconsistency last month. When the <span style="color: black;">Obama administration</span> wanted to project power directly at <span style="color: black;">North Korea</span>'s doorstep, it dispatched F-22s and an aircraft carrier strike group — the very systems the defense secretary has singled out for cuts. &quot;<span style="color: black;">Gates</span> is doing what previous Democratic administrations have done repeatedly, and that is to hollow out our military,&quot; said <span style="color: black;">Frank Gaffney</span>, a defense official in the <span style="color: black;">Reagan administration</span> who directs the <span style="color: black;">Center for Security Policy</span>. &quot;The problem with such cuts in the forces we need to wage those much more difficult and more violent kinds of conflicts is that we put ourselves in a position where we may not be able to deter them as well as fight them,&quot; he said. &quot;That's a terrible mistake and may cost us dearly.&quot; In speeches last spring, <span style="color: black;">Mr. Gates</span> put the services on notice that more weapons cuts were coming. He disputed <span style="color: black;">Navy</span> proponents who say the sea service lacks fighters and ships for adequate global deployment and to keep in check countries such as Iran and <span style="color: black;">China</span>. &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Does the number of warships we have and are building really put America at risk when the</span></u> <span style="color: black; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";">U.S.</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">battle fleet is larger than the next 13 navies combined, 11 of which belong to allies and partners?&quot;</span></u> <span style="color: black; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";">Mr. <strong>Gates</strong></span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">said</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. &quot;Is it a dire threat that by 2020 the <span style="color: black;">United States</span> will have only 20 times more advanced stealth fighters than <span style="color: black;">China</span>?&quot; Days later at the Navy League, he said: &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Our current plan is to have 11 carrier strike groups</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>through 2040 and it's in the budget.

There is no doubt about that. We need to do a vastly better job of protecting those vital elements of our fleet and indeed of our national capabilities.

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">2.2 Rethinking the demand for aircraft carriers: fewer will do The proposed reductions affect not just aircraft, but aircraft carriers as well - and this deserves a closer look. Among US air power assets those that are carrier-based have a special role. Where access to land bases is limited, aircraft carriers can bring tactical air power within reach of enemy bastions. Together with other sea-based strike assets and long-range bombers, carriers can help overcome the anti-access challenge. But this fact should not exclude them from consideration for reduction. In fact, the United States has more of this asset than it reasonably requires. And, it is important to remember that sea-based air power is relatively vulnerable and expensive. Indeed, sortie for sortie, it costs more than twice as much as land-based tactical air - all things considered. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">America's requirement for big-deck aircraft carriers can be divided into a &quot;surge&quot; requirement for crisis response and a peacetime requirement for continuous forward presence</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. <strong>Relevant to the surge requirement is the actual experience of recent wars</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Three or four aircraft carriers were directly engaged in Afghan operations at any one time during October-December 2001. During the first phase of the 2003 Iraq war, four or five were engaged. During the 1999 Kosovo war, one. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In none</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>of these wars <strong>were</strong> the engaged <strong>carriers employed to their fullest</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, however. For instance, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">during</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> the first month of </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">O</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">peration <strong>I</strong>raqi <strong>F</strong>reedom, <strong>naval fighters flew an average of 0.8 sorties per day</strong>. <strong>They are capable of flying two, at least</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> - and the Navy claims they can do more, in a pinch. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Looking to the future: The target attack capability of each air wing will increase significantly <strong>with the addition of smaller, longer-range, and more accurate PGMs</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In 2005 Senate testimony, then Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Vernon Clark, asserted that </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the number of targets that a carrier air wing could attack per day would increase from 700 to more than 1,000 by 2010</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> - having already risen substantially from 200 in 1997. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Implicit in this is the option to reduce the overall number of carriers</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>and wings</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In its FY 2007 budget, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the Navy asserts that, given an 11 carrier fleet, it can surge six carriers for war</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>within 30 days and another within the next 60 days</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This, as a result of its new Fleet Response Plan (FRP). This implies an emergency or &quot;surge&quot; utilization rate of 63 percent. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">A somewhat higher rate could be achieved through <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">changes in homeporting arrangements</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, rotations of crews, further reorganization of maintenance schedules, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">and reduced</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> utilization of carriers for</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>simple <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">presence missions</span></strong>. Some <strong>reform along these lines <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would allow a 9-carrier</span>, 8-wing <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">fleet to surge</span> &quot;five plus one&quot; for crisis response</strong>. <strong>In 2010, these <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">six carriers</span></strong>, fully utilized and equipped with weapons now being fielded or procured, <strong>should be <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">able to strike</span> well over <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">twice as many targets</span> per day as the five that deployed for <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">O</span></strong>peration <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">I</span></strong>raqi <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">F</span></strong>reedom</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Supplementing the future offshore strike capability of US carriers would be the long-range attack capability of America's bomber force</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> - able in the future to carry five times as many PGMs as today (on average). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Also supplementing carrier power would be the rest of the Navy's surface fleet and the four Trident submarines that have been reconfigured for conventional missions</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The surface fleet is equipped with approximately 8,000 Vertical Launch Systems, which can fire Tomahawk missiles - as can the Tridents. The Navy is building its stock of conventional land-attack Tomahawks up towards a total of 6,000 or so. (Approximately 800 were used in Operation Iraqi Freedom.) </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Finally, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the Navy will have mini-carriers to call on as well</span>, once the new class of LHA(R) amphibious assault ships are commissioned</strong>. Among other aircraft, <strong>these will carry 20 F-35s</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. With only eight active and one reserve big-deck carriers in the fleet, the Navy would not be able to keep more than 2.5 of them continuously &quot;on station&quot; during peacetime - even given recent FRP innovations. However, homeporting one more overseas would increase this number, as would a crew rotation scheme. At any rate, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">peacetime <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">naval presence</span> abroad <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">need not center on</span> aircraft <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">carriers</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.

The sinking of the General Belgrano was a defining event in this conflict. It established that the Royal Navy through its SSNs commanded the seas;130 it established a relevant point about what kind of force is best suited to achieving sea control, a prerequisite to sea-based offensive air operations. The submarine posed a formidable threat to the Argentine combat force; it was one which they were not appropriately equipped to negotiate, tipping the scales in favor of the British. Current U.S. Navy outlook towards combat at sea envisions precision firepower netted with shared information dominance. Described as FORCENet and Sea Strike by the Naval Aviation Enterprise in Naval Aviation Vision 2020, its tenets are: FORCENet ties the pillars of Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing together. It is the persistent integration of warriors, sensors, networks, platforms, and weapons into a networked, distributed combat force across the spectrum of conflict from seabed to space and sea to land. It implements the Global Information Grid (GIG) and is the Navy’s portal to GIG Enterprise Services (GIG-ES) – a grid of valueadded information, web, and computing capabilities that improve user access to mission critical data, enhancing the pervasive awareness of the battlespace. It will transform the way we receive information, enabling decision-makers to react quickly and decisively with superb situational awareness. FORCENet will harness information required for knowledge-based combat operations and increased survivability, and will also provide real-time enhanced collaborative planning amongst joint and coalition partners. It will speed the distribution of smart-weapon sensor information, which will improve Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) and facilitate re-strike decisions. It will vastly improve our capabilities in Electronic Warfare (EW), littoral Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and Information Operations (IO), and will enable Naval Aviation combat forces to achieve battlespace dominance in concert with other Naval and Joint forces across the full range of military operations.131 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Sea Strike is the projection of precise, persistent, and responsive offensive firepower</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">.

ANALYSIS Debates regarding large-deck vs. small and medium seabased air platforms have been conducted on more than one occasion in the past. The issue not only concerns the size of the ship, but also whether it should be nuclear or conventionally propelled.133 There was also debate concerning the emphasis and size placed on the U.S. Navy within the Maritime Strategy during the Reagan administration regarding aircraft carriers’ ability to deter and engage the Soviet Union. One view suggested that the budget invested in the naval build-up should be redirected towards NATO ground and air forces.134 When Admiral Elmo Zumwalt became the Chief of Naval Operations in 1970,135 and with an unpopular Vietnam War and weak economy, Congress began considering reductions in the DoD budget. Admiral Zumwalt introduced an idea, borrowed from the British, for a less expensive, smaller aircraft carrier. “His sea-control ship, similar to the new HMS Invincible, would operate about ten helicopters and ten AV-8s for limited ASW, strike, and air-defense missions.” In opposition to his senior aviation advisors, Admiral Zumwalt believed that more small carriers would be more valuable to the Navy than few large carriers.136 In June 2000, after a four-year formal Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) plus three high-level reviews by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Defense Acquisition Board approved the U.S. Navy’s plan to develop a new class of large-deck nuclear-powered aircraft carriers; CVN-21.137 In an article of the June 2001 Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute, David A. Perin discusses the alternatives that were considered and rejected. He states in the article, “the least radical alternative was a mid-sized carrier similar to the Midway (CV-41). It was determined that mid-sized carriers were a little cheaper but provide a lot less combat power.” The data indicated that large decks could generate more sorties and devote the additional sorties to strike missions, and that “a new 75-plane CVX force can generate roughly twice the number of strike sorties as the same number of a (mid-sized) 55-plane carrier.” Perin continues, regarding proposals for small carriers; a “more radical alternative involved a combination of small carriers and other systems, such as land-based aircraft, missile ships, and even large mobile offshore bases.” The AoA found that “one small carrier doesn’t carry enough aircraft, and that the CVX mission-need-statement calls for CVX to conduct simultaneous strike and battlespace dominance operations, and that a small carrier doesn’t carry enough aircraft to meet this fundamental criterion.” Where it was determined that two small carriers could accomplish what one large-deck CVX could do, the CVX AoA found that “two small carriers could do the job but would cost too much, indicating that a CVX large-deck costs less than two-thirds as much to buy and operate as two comparable 40-plane CVX’s”138 Perin argues that STOVL and small carriers are different issues, he states, “…STOVL JSF will likely operate from carriers on some occasions, and might eventually prove desirable for regular carrier application, but this would not change the argument against small decks for the Navy. For example, proponents of STOVL often argue that it would provide more flexible launch and recovery operations on a carrier…the AoA showed that if realized, the advantages would be more important for large carriers that have many aircraft on deck. Conversely, the AoA showed that STOVL aircraft are not needed for an efficient 40-plane carrier design. In sum, STOVL aircraft and carrier size are separate issues. STOVL aircraft make sense for the Marine Corps and perhaps eventually for the Navy. Small carriers don’t make sense for the Navy, even with STOVL aircraft.”139 What Perin, who was a member of the AoA during these deliberations, did not envision, was the asymmetric threats that large decks have been called upon to address, and that they are an inefficient platform for the mission. He minimized the aspect of CVN vulnerability based on historical fact that antiship missile attacks have been very limited, and that the victims were defenseless or unalerted. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Despite</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>the <strong>debate</strong> and analysis conducted in the past regarding the feasibility of incorporating sea-based air platforms in the form of medium or small air-capable ships, <strong>the status quo has been maintained under the premise that a CVN is the right platform for the current and foreseeable strategic threat environment</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Carrier aviation leaders have fought the concept of a small aircraft carrier from the birth of Admiral Zumwalt’s sea-control ship. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Their view is that large-deck carriers are more effective than any number of smaller carriers</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. A large carrier embarks more aircraft, fuel, and ammunition, giving the air wing more staying power; it is also more survivable, through the use of armor, defensive armament, and passive weapon counter-measure systems.140 </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In an age of maneuverable guided antiship cruise missiles of supersonic speed, survivability is a calculated guess</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. Despite the survivability factors mentioned, <strong>the CVN is dependent on maneuvering with its <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">surface ship</span> strike force for <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">protection</span></strong> to enable defense-in-depth, <strong>at considerable costs; costs that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could go to offensive capabilities rather than defense</span> of a ship</strong>. Regarding the stated higher degree of effectiveness, <strong>the concentration of striking power in a single platform makes it a high value target that any determined adversary would be foolish not to neutralize</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The great advance in modern strike warfare has been</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>the increase in precision, brought about by the advance in <strong>guided munitions</strong>. <strong>This has resulted in a shift of U.S. joint doctrine to effects-based strikes; rather than measuring performance by number of sorties</strong> or tonnage of bombs delivered</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Highly specific targeting of a precise location of an enemy and/or critical infrastructure is to be conducted at a time of our choosing to overwhelm an adversary with the intent to minimize, as much as feasibly possible, the potential fallout of collateral damage – to bring about the strategic end state. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Has the advancement in guidance precision altered the need for sea-based air power operating from super carriers? Yes. There is less need for high sortie rates</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The following information supports this. The ability to kill a target is the result of the interplay of two factors: the ability to get a warhead near a target (guidance precision), and the destructive power of the warhead. Guidance technology has in effect doubled the effectiveness of the warhead’s explosive package over the last 50 years.141 The reason for the high probability of impact of the modern warhead is CEP (Circular Error Probable) distance vs. destructive radius, in that, a target’s center lies within the destructive blast radius of modern precision guided warheads. The number of weapons it takes to kill a target is dependent on the weapon’s CEP and the destructiveness of its warhead. It has been asserted that as a result of these improvements, the number of weapons it takes to kill a target has been falling rapidly, and it now only takes a single modern strike fighter to accomplish what an entire fleet of WWII era aircraft did. According to an analysis conducted by the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) Weapons Division-Revolution in Military Affairs Center, “a WWII strategic bomber had a CEP of 1,744 ft., which meant it took 2,794 WWII 500lb bombs to kill a point target. This equates to the full bomb load of 175 B-17 bombers. If one equates this to a modern strike fighter and the four precision weapons it can carry, the modern strike fighter equates to 700 WWII B-17’s in a strategic bombardment role.”142 NAWC’s analysis probes further, “In WWII, the CEP of tactical fighter bombers was significantly better than that of their strategic counterparts; this was primarily the result of their operating at much lower altitudes and applying different bombing techniques. A tactical fighter bomber of the WWII era had an average CEP of 321.3 ft. Fighter bombers of that era normally attacked structural point targets with one larger 1,000lb bomb. Because it took one fighter bomber to deliver one bomb, it took the combined efforts of 41 WWII fighter bombers to kill a point target in the WWII era. If one equates this to the four precision guided weapons that can be carried by a modern strike fighter, the modern strike fighter is equivalent to 164 WWII fighter bombers in a tactical strike role”. A WWII aircraft carrier had about 90 aircraft, depending on type. Therefore it could launch a maximum single wave strike of about 80 aircraft, suggesting that a single modern F/A-18E/F carrier strike fighter armed with its four unitary JSOWs (Joint Standoff Weapon) or LGBs (Laser-guided bomb) is the strike equivalent of two WWII carriers.143 NAWC's analysis neglects to indicate that this scenario would most likely apply in only limited conditions, although an order of magnitude advance seems appropriate, or perhaps two with conditions envisioned by NAWC. Attenuating factors are: 1. If air superiority is in dispute, then first, many of the F/A-18s must assume a fighter role so cannot deliver ordnance. 2. Each F/A-18 lost in air combat or in weapon delivery is in NAWC terms the equivalent of losing two WWII CV deck-loads of strike aircraft. 3. If an F/A-18 carries ordnance for multiple targets, it must travel to each target separately which adds to its exposure and risk.144 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Based on NAWC’s analysis it could feasibly be concluded that <strong>for such efficient lethality the U.S. would not need a force of 12 or so CVNs</strong> to match our past capability, <strong>lest the occasion to be in several places simultaneously, and therefore <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we should distribute</span> these highly lethal <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">strike aircraft into smaller CVs</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (to be called CVLs for the designation given to the small fast aircraft carriers of the WWII era)145 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">that can launch and land them. Accepting NAWC’s carrier-effectiveness analysis at face value, <strong>a CVL fleet with a deck-load of 20, or even 10, F/A-18s in <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">each would be more flexible</span>, more <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">distributable, and</span> more <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">survivable</span></strong> and well worth the additional cost of building smaller &quot;less efficient&quot; aircraft carriers. Moreover one may surmise <strong>the best way to exploit the greatly improved strike accuracy</strong> to which NAWC correctly points <strong>is to deliver the precision strikes from a STOVL (F-35B) flying from a very small CV</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. There are size minimums for launch/landing CTOL that don't apply to STOVL. To a first approximation, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">whatever an F/A-18 can deliver an F-35B STOVL could deliver as well, and at a greater range without refueling</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. Another deduction relating to true cost effectiveness is that if one asserts that a new system is twice as effective as the system it replaces, then by definition, for equal effectiveness one only needs to procure half as many of the new system</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.146 If for example, we observe the scope of current operations, the U.S. Navy does not need the amount of aircraft for these contingencies. What OEF and OIF showed was that U.S. sea-based air power produced sortie rates that delivered ordnance of less than thirty and fourteen percent of the total U.S. effort, respectively. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">CVN-21</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, costing at least eight billion USD plus per ship, <strong>is designed to boost sortie rates up another 25 percent</strong> at “lower costs”, so that carrier aviation could “participate” in the large sortie arena with the Air Force. <strong>That is not what is needed; fire power effects were achieved within relatively short periods of time when needed. CVNs concentrate too much undistributed firepower for the more common, long duration, medium to low intensity conflict scenario</strong>. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates desires the U.S. military to “prepare more for fighting future wars against insurgents and militias such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan, rather than spending so much time and money preparing for conventional conflicts</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.” In unusually strong language, Secretary Gates was recently quoted by the Washington Post,147 and warned against what he described as a tendency in the Pentagon to fall back on Cold War mentalities, he said he feared that “lessons from the U.S. struggle against insurgencies in Iraq could fade unless military commanders understand that today's enemies are the foes of the future.” Gates said there must be a balance between “meeting today's demands and tomorrow's contingencies,” but he expressed concern that the defense establishment is not concentrating hard enough on what might be needed in future conflicts. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">He said the armed services and their corporate counterparts should steer technology and resources toward battling insurgencies. Overall, the kinds of capabilities we will most likely need in the years ahead will often resemble the kinds of capabilities we need today</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">what we must guard against is the kind of backsliding that has occurred in the past, where</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> if nature takes its course, these kinds of capabilities -- that is, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">counterinsurgency - tend to wither on the vine</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Secretary Gates indicated that wars of the past quarter-century point to a need for counterinsurgency strength, including conflicts involving the Soviets in Afghanistan, the Israelis in Lebanon and Americans in Somalia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Smaller, irregular forces - insurgents, guerrillas, terrorists - will find ways, as they always have, to frustrate and neutralize the advantages of larger, regular militaries,&quot; Gates said. &quot;And even nation-states will try to exploit our perceived vulnerabilities in an asymmetric way, rather than play to our inherent strengths</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Secretary Gates said the U.S. military &quot;would be hardpressed to launch a major conventional ground operation elsewhere in the world at this time,&quot; and added: &quot;Where would we sensibly do that? The United States has ample and untapped combat power in our naval and air forces, with the capacity to defeat any, repeat any, adversary who committed an act of aggression, whether in the Persian Gulf, on the Korean Peninsula, or in the Straits of Taiwan. There is a risk, but it is a prudent and manageable one.&quot;148 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">“<strong>Counterinsurgency strength</strong>” <strong>is embodied in alternatives to how the</strong> U.S. and particularly the <strong>U.S. Navy is configured today. The advent of modern technology and smart weapons make the need for super carriers less important. Adapting existing super carriers to modern warfare makes sense, but building exclusively large-deck carriers in today’s environment does not. U.S. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">sea-based air power must </span>configure itself to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">confront asymmetric low-intensity</span> irregular <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">warfare</span></strong> with a view to supporting ground forces and SOF from the sea with the appropriate sea-based air platform. <strong>Flexibility, endurance, remote control and persistence coupled with an intelligent weapon system that can be made to perform from long distances present a viable dispersed alternative to deploying a super carrier and its vast support and defense system. Light aircraft carriers</strong>, coupled with the above cost-effective alternatives and <strong>equipped with capable modern STOVL aircraft, are a must</strong> in view of the above comments made by the Secretary of Defense</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Here is an anecdote that briefly illustrates the notion: Indian Springs, Nevada - The sniper never knew what hit him. The Marines patrolling the street below were taking fire, but did not have a clear shot at the third-story window that the sniper was shooting from. They were pinned down and called for reinforcements. Help came from a Predator drone circling the skies 20 miles away. As the unmanned plane closed in, the infrared camera underneath its nose picked up the muzzle flashes from the window. The sniper was still firing when the Predator's 100-pound Hellfire missile came through the window and eliminated the threat. The airman who fired that missile was 8,000 miles away, at Creech Air Force Base, NV, home of the 432nd air wing. The 432nd officially &quot;stood up,&quot; on May 1, 2007. One year later, two dozen of its drones patrol the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan every hour of every day. And almost all of them are flown by two-man crews sitting in the relative safety of a ground control station (GCS) in the Nevada desert.149 There are several validated and promising innovations to air power that undermine the need for a large-deck nuclear carrier, in low to medium intensity conflict. Specifically, below is a brief survey of just a few: UAVs. The MQ-9 Reaper is the bigger sibling of the RQ- 1/MQ-1 Predator UAV. Capable of striking enemy targets with on-board weapons, the MQ-9 Reaper UAV has conducted CAS and ISR missions. Operational use of Reaper's advanced capabilities marks a step forward in the evolution of unmanned aerial systems. The Reaper is larger and more heavily-armed than the MQ-1 Predator. In addition to its traditional ISR capabilities, it is designed to attack timesensitive targets with persistence and precision, and destroy or disable those targets. The MQ-9 has nearly nine times the range, can fly twice as high and carries more munitions. It can carry nearly the same payload as an F-16, typically two 500-pound laser-guided bombs and four AGM-114 Hellfire missiles.150 Unit system cost is $53.5 million in 2006 fiscal dollars which includes four aircraft (unfortunately a small number) with sensors.151 Warrior UAV. For the near future, the U.S. Army has initiated procurement of an Extended Range Multi-Purpose unmanned aerial vehicle named the “Warrior.” The ERMP Warrior will have the longest range of any UAV system in the Army; it will have multiple on-board weapons capable of loitering over enemy territories for 36 hours at altitudes up to 25,000 feet.152 The Army intends to procure 11 Warrior systems, each with 12 aerial vehicles. The new UAV will be capable of executing missions such as reconnaissance, communications relay, and attack with its multiple weapons, and its network connectivity will reduce the sensor-toshooter time to better suppress enemy threats. Initial operational capability is expected in fiscal year 2009. Total program cost is expected to be about $1 billion.153 Vulture. Further into the future, a revolutionary program is being developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Tactical Technology Office called “Vulture”. The objective of the Vulture program is to develop an aircraft capable of remaining on-station uninterrupted for over five years to perform ISR, and communication missions over an area of interest.154 Once fielded, it’s logical to expect this technology to evolve into an armed version capable of striking time-sensitive targets. Tactical Land Attack Missile (TLAM). The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has been pursuing a supersonic landattack missile design since 2004 under the Revolutionary Approach to Time-Critical Long-Range Strike (RATTLRS) technology demonstration program for a successor to the BGM- 109 Tomahawk. It aims to show the viability of a high-speed (Mach 3+) cruise missile that could attack fleeting vehicles on land and ships at sea as well as stationary objects in conditions under which the ability to hit targets quickly (500NM in 15 min.) is paramount. The program is in development, and, if the RATTLRS demonstration program is successful it hopes to have an operational version around 2012.155 Affordable Weapon System (AWS). In March 2002 the Office of Naval Research was reported to be developing a long-range, low-cost Affordable Missile or Affordable Weapon System (AWS) to complement Tomahawk or successive long-range systems, capable of speeds up to 200 knots and a range of 400-600 nautical miles but costing only $30,000 USD. The AWS is designed to provide a complementary system to long-range land-attack missiles such as Tomahawk using commerciallybased technology. It is equipped with line-of-sight and satellite data links and can fly direct to the target at distances of 600 nautical miles using GPS and INS guidance. There it can loiter for between four and six hours before delivering a 200-lb warhead with precision. A forward observer can re-target the weapon in flight, and the weapon can be called onto a target within a minute. AWS is expected to be launched from a 20-round box launcher, which could be installed on smaller surface warships or even amphibious warfare vessels.156 In a classic work on military resistance to change, Men, Machines, and Modern Times, the late MIT professor Elting E. Morison explains how difficult it is for military organizations to abandon familiar weapon systems. He cites the instance of the first U.S. Navy ship constructed from the beginning with steam propulsion, albeit with sails as well. This was the USS Wampanoag, commissioned in 1866. It could literally run circles around sailing warships whose freedom of maneuver was restricted by the direction and force of the wind. The Navy, though, decommissioned the Wampanoag in 1868. A board of officers decreed, in part, that it would be injurious to the fighting spirit of the captain of a ship if he could not see and direct every element of his ship from his position on deck. Men in an engine room would be outside of the captain's control. This new concept of a steam plant below decks was just too revolutionary to win acceptance quickly. Despite the rest of the leading navies of the world doing so, the U.S. Navy did not build another warship with steam propulsion for 15 years. Arguments for the much greater operational effectiveness of steam propulsion just could not compete with the long tradition of sail. In this tradition, there is no visible inclination in Navy circles today to evaluate whether a carrier-centric Navy is what best suits our nation's needs on the seas today and tomorrow. At the same time, one does not have to do much more than scratch the surface to see that substantial changes in weapons systems are taking place. Startling new technologies are becoming available. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">These developments of increased accuracy and remote control of weapons mean that there is less need for large carriers with large numbers of aircraft and large amounts of ammunition. A few aircraft with precise weapons can accomplish what traditionally has taken much greater effort. Even more startling, manned aircraft are needed less. Missiles can be launched from ships or submarines hundreds of miles away from a target and remotely aimed and guided</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In addition, political circumstances today do not easily allow the large quantities of munitions that putative targets of the Cold War era did. For years our carriers practiced &quot;Alpha Strikes&quot; against the Soviet Union and its allies. These involved as many aircraft as could be loaded and launched in a single strike, each with a maximum bomb load. With the possible exception of China, there is not likely to be a demand for Alpha Strikes in a world of counter-insurgency and counter-terrorist operations. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Warfare at sea, then, is inexorably moving in the direction of unmanned, remotely controlled weapons that are highly accurate and launched at long distances from their targets. This, of course, means less exposure for pilots or none if missiles are launched well away from the target. That can be an important factor in smaller contingencies where U.S. interests are less than vital, but where we opt to fight nonetheless. It can also mean less collateral damage, which can be very important in wars where winning hearts and minds is the key</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.157 In a study conducted by the DoD Office of Force Transformation (OFT) headed by the late Arthur Cebrowski titled Alternative Fleet Architecture Design,158 the challenges of accurately identifying the appropriate composition of the fleet based on forecasting the strategic threat in the immediate future and the uncertainties of escalating procurement costs in an attempt to achieve the hoped-for 375 ship navy are succinctly articulated. The theory of network-centric warfare, including the important advantages available to the warfighter through the full or partial implementation of network-centric capabilities, networking at all levels of military operations, and networked behavior, provides the basis for one of the key design principles for developing an alternative fleet platform architecture. Networking allows for a modular, building block approach to military scaling with applicability across a broad spectrum of missions. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Furthermore, <strong>the architecture of a fleet with dispersed networked surveillance, weapons, and command and control</strong> (C2) <strong>means that platform size can be reduced, while increasing performance through networking of an increased number of platforms. As platform size is decreased, advances in precision and terminal blast effects hold the potential to maintain firepower without losing lethality</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Technologies are being developed to: lighten the payload, thereby extending the endurance and range of unmanned systems; provide robust data links and integrated sensors to detect and target low signature threats; and provide electronic warfare (EW) technology and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) technology tailored to threats in the littoral. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Breakthroughs in technology provide the Navy with the opportunity to leap ahead to deliver a fleet far more capable than the programmed fleet</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. High leverage technologies and the potential payoff they offer the fleet are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Technology…Opportunities and Payoff159 The firepower of the U.S. Navy and USAF are often a duplication of effect when projecting power over land. It is not a duplication of effort in the manner, way or conduit for delivering the firepower; it is feasible to realize that the U.S. Navy and USAF pros and cons could offset each other to enable overland strikes. Thus, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the USN requires sea-based air power</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>for overland power projection, and more importantly, sea-based operations in general, <strong>but it should be more distributed, given the</strong> prospects of modern technology and the <strong>global strategic environment</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. NWDC’s analysis makes a strong argument for the firepower capability of a CVN, and in doing so, also illustrates the concentration of firepower in one platform, which lends itself to the notion of vulnerability. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In OEF and OIF, the preponderance of sortie generation and ordnance delivered came from the USAF, despite massing several carriers in theater. Further, sortie generation capacity of each CVN wasn’t maximized throughout the effort. These factors and the study conducted by the DoD OFT suggest that <strong>U.S. naval aviation should seriously consider procurement of smaller, more cost effective sea-based air platforms that would allow flexibility in tailoring the platform to changing campaign requirements without losing lethality</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. VI. CONCLUSION The U.S. National Security Strategy states that America is at war against the rise of terrorism, a war that is fueled by an aggressive ideology of hatred and murder.160 The NSS also states that “defeating terrorists requires a long-term strategy and a break with old patterns; we can no longer rely on deterrence to keep terrorists at bay.” The NSS provides four pillars for the way ahead in addressing this threat: 1. Prevent attacks by terrorist networks before they occur. 2. Deny weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to rogue states and to terrorist allies who would use them without hesitation. 3. Deny terrorist groups the support and sanctuary of rogue states. 4. Deny the terrorists control of any nation that they would use as a base and launching pad for terror.161 In support of the NSS, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the U.S. National Defense Strategy calls for continuous transformation. The NDS states that “continuous defense transformation is part of a wider governmental effort to transform America’s national security institutions to meet 21st century challenges and opportunities. <strong>Just <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">as our challenges change</span> continuously, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">so too must our military capabilities</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.” The NDS also states that </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">transformation is</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>not only about technology; it is also <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">about</span></u></span></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">: 1. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Changing the way we think about challenges</span> and opportunities</strong>; 2. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Adapting the defense establishment</span> to that new perspective; <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and</span></strong>, 3. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Refocusing capabilities</span> to meet future challenges, not those we are already most prepared to meet</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.162 The NDS also addresses irregular warfare and states that “it will be a key conflict for the foreseeable future. Challenges from terrorist extremist organizations and their state and non-state supporters will involve our forces in complex security problems for some time to come, redefining past conceptions of general purpose forces.”163 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">To guide American military forces within this global threat environment, <strong>the Q</strong>uadrennial <strong>D</strong>efense <strong>R</strong>eview <strong>envisions a joint maritime force that “will conduct highly distributed operations with a networked fleet that is more capable of projecting power</strong> in the brown and green waters of coastal areas</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.”164 The U.S. National Military Strategy discusses overseas presence posture of U.S. military forces and states that “</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">enhancing U.S. overseas presence and global footprint must improve the ability of regional forces to employ an expeditionary approach in response to regional and global contingencies. They must remain scalable, supporting plans to surge forces during crisis when and where they are needed</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.”165 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In light of these national strategic guiding points, <strong>the U.S. Navy should seriously reconsider its requirement of maintaining the size of its current fleet of super carriers. It should explore an immediate shift in procurement strategy</strong> to more appropriately address threats to national security</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This thesis concludes that </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">one important and advantageous change should be <strong>not to spend on solely large-deck carriers</strong>. <strong>To smoothly transform naval aviation, the Navy should invest in a blend of CVNs and small to medium carriers, be they nuclear or conventional</strong>. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Smaller “CVLs”</span></strong> provide two important capabilities we must seek: 1. It <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">allows naval aviation to engage a peer adversary in a more distributed manner; and</span></strong>, 2. It <strong>allows naval aviation <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to</span> appropriately <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">tailor the size of a carrier strike group</span> in small <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to</span> medium intensity <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">conflict scenarios</span>, some of which will be of long duration</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Many other world navies do well and are content with the idea of aircraft carriers of 40,000 ton displacement and less. The USN does not give the “CV” classification to ships within its navy which however are comparable in size and capability to ships which other navies are proud to call aircraft carriers.166 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The key point is - that <strong>sea-based air is not as critical to the national security as in past eras, but it can, and should be, deliverable in smaller packages</strong> tailored to the situation. This is <strong>especially so when more cost effective methods to embark sea-based air power exist</strong>. <strong>It is far less costly and risky to embark and operate V/STOL aircraft in a combat situation</strong> than attempting to recover CTOL aircraft aboard a carrier, in difficult conditions, that are in a tank-or-eject situation, as described in the OEF case analysis - an avoidable risk. <strong>The procurement, operating and maintenance costs of large-deck carriers with catapult and arresting gear is higher than that for a small or medium sized air capable V/STOL ship</strong>. <strong>This type of ship</strong>, - a “CVL” - <strong>with an embarked air wing of highly capable strike/fighters of the JSF type</strong>, UAV/UCAVs or V-22 Ospreys, <strong>can be configured for many missions to include airborne early warning. They will make for a highly viable complement, or potential alternative to CVNs</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Has there ever been a case in history where a battleship was sent to defend a nation without her guns? This bizarre scenario may actually occur <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">unless the</span> US <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Navy deals with it’s “fighter gap”</span> of several hundred warplanes</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. From <span style="color: black;">DoD Buzz</span> we learn: At a discussion this week on the Navy’s “fighter gap” at the Center for National Policy in Washington, one of the defense world’s most knowledgeable sources on all things Navy, CRS’ Ron O’Rourke, tried to put a definitive number on that “gap.” From the Navy’s public statements, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">O’Rourke calculated the number at anywhere between 125 and 243 aircraft, although some in industry contend it’s 300 or more. The peak of this shortfall is projected to occur around 2015; the Navy contends <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a shortage</span></strong> of strike-fighters <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could reduce the number of available carriers</span> from 11 <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to seven</span></strong> around that time. <strong>An interesting phenomena in recent decades has been the dramatic increase in aircraft carrier size, while the number of warplanes needed on her spacious decks have actually declined</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. With the <span style="color: black;">advent of new precision bombs</span> in modern warfare, widespread use at sea not starting until the 1990′s, naval aircraft are more capable than ever. With one plane (or UAV) having the ability to destroy a target once required of huge airwings and multiple sorties, it only stands to reason </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">we have entered a revolution in carrier power, which a few big decks with sizable numbers of strike bombers fail to adequately take advantage of</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Yet the Navy still insists our shrinking number of 100,000 ton flattops with their 90 warplanes are the only way to deploy airpower at sea! One person who says carrier numbers should be rethought is strategist Frank Hoffman, who argued in a<span style="color: black;"> recent CNAS </span>paper that at an estimated $11 billion for the new Ford class carrier, large deck carriers are too costly, too oriented towards open-ocean fighting between battle fleets and air wings are too short ranged. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The Navy should reduce the number of carriers</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> to no more than 8 and should emphasize long range unmanned strike aircraft such as the N-UCAS <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and make</span> more innovative <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">use of</span> the aviation-capable large deck <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">amphibious ships for</span> forward <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">presence and power projection</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, Hoffman said. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">We still see a great need for naval airpower, but it should be spread among a </span></u></strong><strong><span style="color: black; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">many small ships</span></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, rather than a handful of large ones</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. Such a strategy would take better advantage of the individual capabilities of modern aircraft equipped with smart bombs and missiles</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. I can see a group of small corvettes each able to launch 2-3 UCAVs so armed as a carrier replacement for many functions, such as supporting troops in a land battle. The strategy we cling to perhaps for nostalgia reasons emphasizes the ship is more important than the weapon she carries. But what is a battleship without her guns but a hollow shell?</span></span><br />

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">Although, historically, DoD has made some use of each of these alternative approaches, as in the past, the focus of existing modernization plans is on replacing current-generation weapons with much more capable and costly next-generation sys- tems. As noted in the last chapter, in most cases, the Services’ modernization plans continue to be centered on the acquisition of next-generation weapon systems with unit procurement costs projected to be two-to-three times higher than those of the systems they are intended to replace. Those high cost programs include the DDG- 1000 guided-missile destroyer and the CG(X) guided-missile cruiser, the FCS, and the F-22 and F-35 fighters. In the case of the LCS, the Navy’s decision to take a different approach—to ac- quire a new ship that will cost essentially the same amount to procure as the ship it will be replacing—appears to be driven primarily by a belief that </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the importance of numbers</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, relative to quality, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has increased</span> in recent years <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and is likely to continue to grow</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.

The contract is Cost Plus Incentive Fee, with a value of $2,429,828,879 and completion scheduled for February 2013. Read the DefenseLink announcement <span style="color: black;">here</span>. If you’re thinking “Is that all?”, remember that this project has already been funded by $65,292,403 on 16-Nov-06, $190,704,758 on 24-Oct-07 and $300,705,466 on 27-Oct-08, for a grand total of about $2,986 million. And in case you were wondering, the comparable number for the last RCOH of a CVN was $2,437 million, so the new project is only costing 22% more than the last time. That seems reasonable, doesn’t it? No? Oh and, by the way, the Theodore Roosevelt, which was delivered in 1986, only cost $1.2 billion in the first place: in today’s money, that’s just over $3 billion.

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">This raises a more fundamental question: What is the value of naval power in a world in which naval battles are not fought? To frame the question more clearly, let us begin by noting that </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the U</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">has maintained global maritime hegemony since the end of World War II</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Except for the failed Soviet attempt to partially challenge the United States, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the most important geopolitical fact since World War II was that the world’s oceans were effectively under the control of the U.S. Navy</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Prior to World War II, there were multiple contenders for maritime power, such as Britain, Japan and most major powers. No one power, not even Britain, had global maritime hegemony. The United States now does. The question is whether this hegemony has any real value at this time — a question made relevant by the issue of whether to blockade Iran. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The U</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">controls the blue water. To be a little more precise, the U.S. Navy can assert direct and overwhelming control over any portion of the blue water it wishes, and it can do so in multiple places</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. It cannot directly control all of the oceans at the same time. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">However, the total available naval force that can be deployed by non-U.S. powers (friendly and other) is so limited that they lack the ability, even taken together, to assert control anywhere should the U</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">challenge their presence. This is an unprecedented situation historically</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The current situation is, of course, invaluable to the United States. It means that a seaborne invasion of the United States by any power is completely impractical. Given the geopolitical condition of the United States, the homeland is secure from conventional military attack but vulnerable to terrorist strikes and nuclear attacks. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">At the same time, the U</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">is in a position to project forces at will to any part of the globe.

It was the most important geopolitical consequence of World War II, and one that still defines the world. The issue for the United States is not whether it should abandon control of the seas — that would be irrational in the extreme. Rather, the question is whether it has to exert itself at all in order to retain that control. Other powers either have abandoned attempts to challenge the United States, have fallen short of challenging the United States or have confined their efforts to building navies for extremely limited uses, or for uses aligned with the United States. No one has a shipbuilding program under way that could challenge the United States for several generations. One argument, then, is that the United States should cut its naval forces radically — since they have, in effect, done their job. Mothballing a good portion of the fleet would free up resources for other military requirements without threatening U.S. ability to control the sea-lanes. Should other powers attempt to build fleets to challenge the United States, the lead time involved in naval construction is such that the United States would have plenty of opportunities for re-commissioning ships or building new generations of vessels to thwart the potential challenge. The counterargument normally given is that </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the U.S. Navy provides a critical service in what is called littoral warfare</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In other words, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">while the Navy might not be needed immediately to control sea-lanes, it carries out critical functions in securing access to those lanes and projecting rapid power into countries where the U</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">might want to intervene</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Thus, U.S. aircraft carriers can bring tactical airpower to bear relatively quickly in any intervention. Moreover, the Navy’s amphibious capabilities — particularly those of deploying and supplying the U.S. Marines — make for a rapid deployment force that, when coupled with Naval airpower, can secure hostile areas of interest for the United States. That argument is persuasive, but it poses this problem: The Navy provides a powerful option for war initiation by the United States, but it cannot by itself sustain the war. In any sustained conflict, the Army must be brought in to occupy territory — or, as in Iraq, the Marines must be diverted from the amphibious specialty to serve essentially as Army units. Naval air by itself is a powerful opening move, but greater infusions of airpower are needed for a longer conflict. Naval transport might well be critically important in the opening stages, but commercial transport sustains the operation. If one accepts this argument, the case for a Navy of the current size and shape is not proven. How many carrier battle groups are needed and, given the threat to the carriers, is an entire battle group needed to protect them? If we consider the Iraq war in isolation, for example, it is apparent that the Navy served a function in the defeat of Iraq’s conventional forces. It is not clear, however, that the Navy has served an important role in the attempt to occupy and pacify Iraq. And, as we have seen in the case of Iran, a blockade is such a complex politico-military matter that the option not to blockade tends to emerge as the obvious choice. The Risk Not Taken The argument for slashing the Navy can be tempting. But consider the counterargument. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">First, and most important, we must consider the crises the U</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">has not experienced. The presence of the U.S. Navy has shaped the ambitions of primary and secondary powers. The threshold for challenging the Navy has been so high that few have even initiated serious challenges. Those that might be trying to do so, like the Chinese, understand that it requires a substantial diversion of resources. Therefore, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the mere existence of U.S. naval power has been effective in averting crises</span> that likely would have occurred otherwise</strong>. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Reducing the power of the U.S. Navy</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, or fine-tuning it, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">would not only open the door to challenges but also eliminate</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>a</u></span></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>useful, if not <strong>essential, element in U.S. strategy — <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the ability to bring</span></strong> relatively <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">rapid force to bear</span></strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. There are times when the Navy’s use is tactical, and times when it is strategic. At this moment in U.S. history, the role of naval power is highly strategic. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">domination of the</span> world’s <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">oceans represents the foundation stone of U.S. grand strategy</span>. It allows the U</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">to take risks while minimizing consequences</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. It facilitates risk-taking. Above all, it eliminates the threat of sustained conventional attack against the homeland. U.S. grand strategy has worked so well that this risk appears to be a phantom. The dispersal of U.S. forces around the world attests to what naval power can achieve. It is illusory to believe that this situation cannot be reversed, but it is ultimately a generational threat. Just as U.S. maritime hegemony is measured in generations, the threat to that hegemony will emerge over generations. The apparent lack of utility of naval forces in secondary campaigns, like Iraq, masks the fundamentally indispensable role the Navy plays in U.S. national security. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">That does not mean that the Navy as currently structured is sacrosanct — far from it</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. Peer powers will be able to challenge the U.S. fleet, but not by building their own fleets</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. Rather, the construction of effective anti-ship missile systems — which can destroy merchant ships as well as overwhelm U.S. naval anti-missile systems — represents a low-cost challenge to U.S. naval power</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This is particularly true when these anti-ship missiles are tied to space-based, real-time reconnaissance systems. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">A major power such as China need not be able to mirror the U.S. Navy in order to challenge it</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Whatever happens in Iraq — or Iran — <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the centrality of naval power is unchanging</span></strong>. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">But the threat to naval power evolves</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.

It inspires fears and jealousies. The United States is not immune to error, like all other nations, and because of its size and importance in the international system those errors are magnified and take on greater significance than the errors of less powerful nations. Compared to the ideal Kantian international order, in which all the world 's powers would be peace-loving equals, conducting themselves wisely, prudently, and in strict obeisance to international law, the unipolar system is both dangerous and unjust. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Compared to any plausible alternative in the real world, however, it is relatively stable and less likely to produce a major war between great powers</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. It is also comparatively benevolent, from a liberal perspective, for it is more conducive to the principles of economic and political liberalism that Americans and many others value. American predominance does not stand in the way of progress toward a better world, therefore. It stands in the way of regression toward a more dangerous world. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The choice is not between an American-dominated order and a world that looks like the European Union</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The future international order will be shaped by those who have the power to shape it. The leaders of a post-American world will not meet in Brussels but in Beijing, Moscow, and Washington. The return of great powers and great games </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">If the world is marked by the persistence of unipolarity, it is nevertheless also being shaped by the reemergence of competitive national ambitions</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> of the kind that have shaped human affairs from time immemorial. During the Cold War, this historical tendency of great powers to jostle with one another for status and influence as well as for wealth and power was largely suppressed by the two superpowers and their rigid bipolar order. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has not been powerful enough, and probably could never be powerful enough, to suppress by itself the normal ambitions of nations. This does not mean the world has returned to multipolarity, since none of the large powers is in range of competing with the superpower for global influence. Nevertheless, several large powers are now competing for regional predominance, both with the United States and with each other. National ambition drives China's foreign policy today, and although it is tempered by prudence and the desire to appear as unthreatening as possible to the rest of the world, the Chinese are powerfully motivated to return their nation to what they regard as its traditional position as the preeminent power in East Asia. They do not share a European, postmodern view that power is passé; hence their now two-decades-long military buildup and modernization. Like the Americans, they believe power, including military power, is a good thing to have and that it is better to have more of it than less. Perhaps more significant is the Chinese perception, also shared by Americans, that status and honor, and not just wealth and security, are important for a nation. Japan, meanwhile, which in the past could have been counted as an aspiring postmodern power -- with its pacifist constitution and low defense spending -- now appears embarked on a more traditional national course. Partly this is in reaction to the rising power of China and concerns about North Korea 's nuclear weapons. But it is also driven by Japan's own national ambition to be a leader in East Asia or at least not to play second fiddle or &quot;little brother&quot; to China. China and Japan are now in a competitive quest with each trying to augment its own status and power and to prevent the other 's rise to predominance, and this competition has a military and strategic as well as an economic and political component. Their competition is such that a nation like South Korea, with a long unhappy history as a pawn between the two powers, is once again worrying both about a &quot;greater China&quot; and about the return of Japanese nationalism. As Aaron Friedberg commented, the East Asian future looks more like Europe's past than its present. But it also looks like Asia's past. Russian foreign policy, too, looks more like something from the nineteenth century. It is being driven by a typical, and typically Russian, blend of national resentment and ambition. A postmodern Russia simply seeking integration into the new European order, the Russia of Andrei Kozyrev, would not be troubled by the eastward enlargement of the EU and NATO, would not insist on predominant influence over its &quot;near abroad,&quot; and would not use its natural resources as means of gaining geopolitical leverage and enhancing Russia 's international status in an attempt to regain the lost glories of the Soviet empire and Peter the Great. But Russia, like China and Japan, is moved by more traditional great-power considerations, including the pursuit of those valuable if intangible national interests: honor and respect. Although Russian leaders complain about threats to their security from NATO and the United States, the Russian sense of insecurity has more to do with resentment and national identity than with plausible external military threats. 16 Russia's complaint today is not with this or that weapons system. It is the entire post-Cold War settlement of the 1990s that Russia resents and wants to revise. But that does not make insecurity less a factor in Russia 's relations with the world; indeed, it makes finding compromise with the Russians all the more difficult. One could add others to this list of great powers with traditional rather than postmodern aspirations. India 's regional ambitions are more muted, or are focused most intently on Pakistan, but it is clearly engaged in competition with China for dominance in the Indian Ocean and sees itself, correctly, as an emerging great power on the world scene. In the Middle East there is Iran, which mingles religious fervor with a historical sense of superiority and leadership in its region. 17 Its nuclear program is as much about the desire for regional hegemony as about defending Iranian territory from attack by the United States. Even the European Union, in its way, expresses a pan-European national ambition to play a significant role in the world, and it has become the vehicle for channeling German, French, and British ambitions in what Europeans regard as a safe supranational direction. Europeans seek honor and respect, too, but of a postmodern variety. The honor they seek is to occupy the moral high ground in the world, to exercise moral authority, to wield political and economic influence as an antidote to militarism, to be the keeper of the global conscience, and to be recognized and admired by others for playing this role. Islam is not a nation, but many Muslims express a kind of religious nationalism, and the leaders of radical Islam, including al Qaeda, do seek to establish a theocratic nation or confederation of nations that would encompass a wide swath of the Middle East and beyond. Like national movements elsewhere, Islamists have a yearning for respect, including self-respect, and a desire for honor. Their national identity has been molded in defiance against stronger and often oppressive outside powers, and also by memories of ancient superiority over those same powers. China had its &quot;century of humiliation.&quot; Islamists have more than a century of humiliation to look back on, a humiliation of which Israel has become the living symbol, which is partly why even Muslims who are neither radical nor fundamentalist proffer their sympathy and even their support to violent extremists who can turn the tables on the dominant liberal West, and particularly on a dominant America which implanted and still feeds the Israeli cancer in their midst. Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> in these regions </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">with China</span></u></strong> <u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">in East and Central Asia, <strong>with Iran</strong> in the Middle East and Central Asia, <strong>and with Russia</strong> in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as &quot;No. 1&quot; and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">American predominance prevents</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>these <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">rivalries from intensifying</span> -- its regional as well as its global predominance.

One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">most</span> of these powers <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would possess nuclear weapons</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">That could make wars between them</span></strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> less likely, or it could simply make them </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">more <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">catastrophic</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; padding: 0in;">U</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; padding: 0in;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates</span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters</span></u></strong><u>. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In a</span></strong> more genuinely <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">multipolar world</span></strong>, however, it would not. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Nations would compete for naval dominance</span></strong> at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. <strong>Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe 's stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world 's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">War could erupt between China and Taiwan</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>and draw in both the U</u></span></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">and Japan.

That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In Europe</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, too, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the departure of the U</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- could be destabilizing.

Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism.

Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn 't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The alternative to American predominance</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>in the region is not balance and peace. It <strong>is further competition</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The alternative to American regional predominance</span></u></strong> <u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">in the Middle East and elsewhere <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is not</span> a new <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">regional stability</span></strong>. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, <strong>the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements.

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">In recent years, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">defense analysts in the U</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">have substantially revised their estimates of China's missile prowess</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. A decade ago, most observers rated Beijing's ballistic missiles as inaccurate, blunt weapons limited to terrorizing civilian populations. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Today, the emerging consensus within the U.S. strategic community is that China's arsenal can inflict lethal harm with precision on a wide range of military targets, including ports and airfields</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. As a consequence, many observers have jettisoned previously sanguine net assessments that conferred decisive, qualitative advantages to Taiwan in the cross-strait military balance. Indeed, the debates on China's coercive power and Taiwan's apparent inability to resist such pressure have taken on a palpably fatalistic tone. A 2009 RAND monograph warns that </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">China's large, modern missile and air forces are likely to pose a virtually insurmountable challenge to Taiwanese and American efforts to command the air over the strait and the island</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The authors of the report believe that massive ballistic-missile salvos launched against Taiwan's air bases would severely hamper Taipei's ability to generate enough fighter sorties to contest air superiority. They state: &quot;As China's ability to deliver accurate fire across the strait grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult and soon may be impossible for the United States and Taiwan to protect the island's military and civilian infrastructures from serious damage.&quot;1 As a result, the authors observe, &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">China's ability to suppress Taiwan and local U.S. air bases with ballistic and cruise missiles seriously threatens the defense's ability to maintain control of the air over the strait</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot;2 They further assert, &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The U</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">can no longer be confident of winning the battle for the air in the air. This represents a dramatic change from the first five-plus decades of the China- Taiwan confrontation</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot;3 An unclassified Defense Intelligence Agency report assessing the state of Taiwan's air defenses raises similar concerns. The study notes that Taiwanese fighter aircraft would be unable to take to the air in the absence of well-protected airfield runways, suggesting a major vulnerability to the island's airpower. The agency further maintains that Taiwan's capacity to endure missile attacks on runways and to repair them rapidly will determine the integrity of the island's air-defense system.4 While the report withholds judgment on whether Taipei can maintain air superiority following Chinese missile strikes in a conflict scenario, a key constituent of the U.S. intelligence community clearly recognizes a growing danger to Taiwan's defense. China's missiles also threaten Taiwan's ability to defend itself at sea. William Murray contends that China could sink or severely damage many of Taiwan's warships docked at naval piers with salvos of ballistic missiles. He argues that &quot;the Second Artillery's [China's strategic missile command's] expanding inventory of increasingly accurate [short-range ballistic missiles] probably allows Beijing to incapacitate much of Taiwan's navy and to ground or destroy large portions of the air force in a surprise missile assault and follow-on barrages.&quot;5 These are stark, sobering conclusions. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Equally troubling is growing evidence that <strong>China has turned its attention to Japan</strong>, home to some of the largest naval and air bases in the world</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Beijing has long worried about Tokyo's potential role in a cross-strait conflagration. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In particular, Chinese analysts chafe at the apparent American freedom to use the Japanese archipelago as a springboard to intervene in a Taiwan contingency</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In the past, China kept silent on what the People's Liberation Army (PLA) would do in response to Japanese logistical support of U.S. military operations. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Recent PLA publications</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, in contrast, suggest that the logic of missile coercion against Taiwan could be readily applied to U.S. forward presence in Japan. The writings </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">convey a high degree of confidence that China's missile forces could compel Tokyo to limit American use of naval bases while selectively destroying key facilities on those bases</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. <strong>These doctrinal developments demand close attention from Washington and Tokyo, lest the transpacific alliance be caught flat-footed in a future crisis with Beijing</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This article is a first step toward better understanding how the Chinese evaluate the efficacy of missile coercion against American military targets in Japan. This article focuses narrowly on Chinese assessments of U.S. naval bases in Japan, excluding the literature on such other key locations as the Kadena and Misawa air bases. The writings on the American naval presence are abundant and far more extensive than studies on the land and air components of U.S. basing arrangements. The dispatch of two carrier battle groups to Taiwan's vicinity during the 1996 cross-strait crisis stimulated Beijing's reevaluation of its military strategy toward the island. Not surprisingly, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the Chinese are obsessed with the U.S. aircraft carrier, including the</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>facilities and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">bases that support its operations</span></u></span></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. It is against this rich milieu that this study explores how the Chinese conceive their missile strategy to complicate American use of military bases along the Japanese archipelago. This article first explores the reasons behind Beijing's interest in regional bases and surveys the Chinese literature on the U.S. naval presence in Japan to illustrate the amount of attention being devoted to the structure of American military power in Asia. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Chinese analysts see U.S. dependence on a few locations for power projection as a major vulnerability</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Second, it turns to </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Chinese doctrinal publications</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, which </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">furnish astonishing details as to how the PLA might employ ballistic missiles to complicate or deny U.S. use of Japanese port facilities. Chinese defense planners place substantial faith in the coercive value of missile tactics</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Third, the article assesses China's conventional theater ballistic missiles that would be employed against U.S. regional bases. Fourth, it critiques the Chinese writings, highlighting some faulty assumptions about the anticipated effects of missile coercion. Finally, the study identifies some key operational dilemmas that the U.S.-Japanese alliance would likely encounter in a PLA missile campaign. EXPLAINING CHINA'S INTEREST IN REGIONAL BASES </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Taiwan remains the animating force behind China's strategic calculus with respect to regional bases in Asia. Beijing's <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">inability to respond to</span> the display of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">U.S. naval power at the</span> height of the 1996 <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Taiwan Strait</span> crisis proved highly embarrassing</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. There is evidence that the PLA had difficulty in monitoring the movement of the two carrier battle groups, much less in offering its civilian leaders credible military options in response to the carrier presence. <strong>This galling experience <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">steeled Beijing's resolve to preclude U.S. naval deployments</span> near Taiwan <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in a future crisis</span>. Notably, the Yokosuka-based USS Independence</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (CV 62) </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">was the first carrier to arrive at the scene</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>in March 1996, <strong>cementing Chinese expectations that Washington would dispatch a carrier from Japan in a contingency over Taiwan</strong>. <strong>Beyond Taiwan, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">other territorial disputes</span> along China's nautical periphery <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could involve U.S. naval intervention</span>. A military crisis arising from <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">conflicting</span> Sino-Japanese <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">claims over the Senkaku</span></strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Diaoyu) </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">islands</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>northwest of Taiwan <strong>could compel an American reaction</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. While doubts linger in some Japanese policy circles as to whether foreign aggression against the islands would trigger Washington's defense commitments as stipulated by the U.S.-Japanese security treaty, joint allied exercises and war games since 2006 suggest that the U.S. military is closely watching events in the East China Sea. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Farther south, <strong>Chinese territorial claims over large swaths of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the South China Sea</span> could also be sources of regional tensions</strong>. <strong>If a local tussle there escalated into a larger conflagration that threatened international shipping, the U.S. Navy might be ordered to maintain freedom of navigation. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In both scenarios, the U.S. carrier</span> based in Japan and other strike groups operating near Asian waters <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would be called</span> upon as <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">first</span> responders</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Concrete territorial disputes that have roiled Asian stability are not the only reasons that American naval power would sortie from regional bases to the detriment of Chinese interests. More abstract and esoteric dynamics may be at work. For example, Chinese leaders fret about the so-called Malacca dilemma. China's heavy dependence on seaborne energy supplies that transit the Malacca Strait has set off Chinese speculation that the United States might seek to blockade that maritime choke point to coerce Beijing.6 This insecurity stems less from judgments about the possibility or feasibility of such a naval blockade than from the belief that a great power like China should not entrust its energy security to the fickle goodwill of the United States. If the U.S. Navy were ever called upon to fulfill an undertaking of such magnitude, forward basing in Asia would undoubtedly play a pivotal role in sustaining what could deteriorate into a protracted blockade operation. Chinese analysts have also expressed a broader dissatisfaction with America's self-appointed role as the guardian of the seas. Sea-power advocates have vigorously pushed for a more expansive view of China's prerogatives along the maritime periphery of the mainland. They bristle at the U.S. Navy's apparent presumption of the right to command any parcel of the ocean on earth, including areas that China considers its own nautical preserves. Some take issue with the 2007 U.S. maritime strategy, a policy document that baldly states, &quot;We will be able to impose local sea control wherever necessary, ideally in concert with friends and allies, but by ourselves if we must.&quot;7 Lu Rude, a former professor at Dalian Naval Academy, cites this passage as evidence of U.S. &quot;hegemonic thinking.&quot; He concludes, &quot;Clearly, what is behind 'cooperation' is America's interests, having 'partners or the participation of allies' likewise serves America's global interests.&quot;8 Some Chinese, then, object to the very purpose of U.S. sea power in Asia, which relies on a constellation of regional bases for its effects to be felt (see map). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Long-standing regional flash points and domestic expectations of a more assertive China as it goes to sea suggest that Beijing's grudging acceptance of U.S. forward presence could be eroding even more quickly than once thought. Against this backdrop of increasing Chinese ambivalence toward American naval power, U.S. basing arrangements in Japan have come into sharper focus</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. CHINESE VIEWS OF U.S. NAVAL BASES IN JAPAN Some Chinese strategists appraise Washington's military posture in the Asia-Pacific region in stark geopolitical terms. Applying the &quot;defense perimeter of the Pacific&quot; logic elaborated by Secretary of State Dean Acheson in the early Cold War, they see their na - tion enclosed by concentric, layered &quot;island chains.&quot; The United States and its allies, they argue, can encircle China or blockade the Chinese mainland from island strongholds, where powerful naval expeditionary forces are based. Analysts who take such a view conceive of the island chains in various ways. Yu Yang and Qi Xiaodong, for example, describe U.S. basing architecture in Asia as a &quot;three line configuration [...].&quot;9 The first line stretches in a sweeping arc from Japan and South Korea to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, forming a &quot;zone of forward bases[...].&quot; This broad notion that the U.S. presence in the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean constitutes a seamless, interlocking set of bases is widely shared in Chinese strategic circles.10 The second line connects Guam and Australia. The last line of bases runs north from Hawaii through Midway to the Aleutians, terminating at Alaska. While these island chains may bear little resemblance to actual U.S. thinking and planning, that the Chinese pay such attention to the geographic structure of American power in Asia is quite notable. These observers discern a cluster of mutually supporting bases, ports, and access points along these island chains. Among the networks of bases in the western Pacific, those located on the Japanese archipelago-the northern anchor of the first island chain-stand out, for the Chinese. Modern Navy, a monthly journal published by the Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Navy, produced a seven-part series on Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force in 2004 and 2005. Notably, it devoted an entire article to Japan's main naval bases, including Yokosuka, Sasebo, Kure, and Maizuru.11 The depth of the coverage of these bases is rather remarkable, especially when compared to the sparse reporting on similar topics in the United States and in Japan. Perhaps </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">no other place captures the Chinese imagination as much as Yokosuka</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, which analysts portray as <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the centerpiece of U.S. basing in Asia</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.12 One analysis depicts a &quot;Northeast Asian base group [...]&quot; radiating outward from Yokosuka to Sasebo, Pusan, and Chinhae.13 Writers provide a wide range of details about the Yokosuka naval base, including its precise location, the surrounding geography, the number of piers (particularly those suitable for aircraft carriers), the types and number of maintenance facilities, and the storage capacity of munitions, fuel, and other supply depots.14 Wu Jian, for instance, finds the geographic features of Yokosuka comparable to those of Dalian, a major base of the Chinese navy's North Sea Fleet.15 Beyond physical similarities, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Yokosuka evokes unpleasant memories for the Chinese. One commentator recalls the U.S. transfer of 203 mm heavy artillery from Yokosuka to Nationalist forces on Jinmen during the 1958 Taiwan Strait crisis</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.16 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Tracking more recent events, another observer notes that the Kitty Hawk Strike Group's deployments from Yokosuka to waters near Taiwan invariably coincided with the presidential elections on the island, in 2000, 2004, and 2008</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.17 As Pei Huai opines, &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Yokosuka has all along irritated the nerves of the Chinese people</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot;18 Moreover, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Chinese analysts are keenly aware of Yokosuka's strategic position</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. As Du Chaoping asserts: </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Yokosuka is the U.S. Navy's main strategic point of concentration and deployment in the Far East and is the ideal American stronghold for employing maritime forces in the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean regions</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. A carrier deployed there is akin to the sharpest dagger sheathed in the Western Pacific by the U.S. Navy. It can control the East Asian mainland to the west and it can enter the Indian Ocean to the southwest to secure Malacca, Hormuz, and other important thoroughfares.19 Ma Haiyang concurs: The Yokosuka base controls the three straits of Soya, Tsugaru, Tsushima and the sea and air transit routes in the Indian Ocean. As the key link in the &quot;island chain,&quot; it can support ground operations on the Korean Peninsula and naval operations in the Western Pacific. It can support combat in the Middle East and Persian Gulf regions while monitoring and controlling the wide sea areas of the Indian Ocean. Its strategic position is extremely important.20 It is notable that both Du and Ma conceive of Yokosuka as a central hub that tightly links the Pacific and Indian oceans into an integrated theater of operations. Intriguingly, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">some Chinese commentators view Yokosuka as the front line of the U.S.-Japanese defense cooperation on missile defense. They worry that Aegis-equipped destroyers armed with ballistic-missile-defense (BMD) systems based in Yokosuka could erode China's nuclear deterrent</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Indeed, analysts see concentrations of sea-based BMD capabilities falling roughly along the three island chains described above. Ren Dexin describes Yokosuka as the first line of defense against ballistic missiles, while Pearl Harbor and San Diego provide additional layers.21 Yokosuka is evocatively portrayed as the &quot;forward battlefield position&quot; (...), the indispensable vanguard for the sea-based BMD architecture.22 For some Chinese, these concentric rings or picket lines of sea power appear tailored specifically to bring down ballistic missiles fired across the Pacific from locations as diverse as the Korean Peninsula, mainland China, India, or even Iran.23 Specifically, Aegis ships in Yokosuka, Pearl Harbor, and San Diego would be positioned to shoot down missiles in their boost, midcourse, and terminal phases, respectively.24 Chinese observers pay special attention to Aegis deployments along the first island chain. Some believe that Aegis ships operating in the Yellow, East, and South China seas would be able to monitor the launch of any long-range ballistic missile deployed in China's interior and perhaps to intercept the vehicle in its boost phase. Dai Yanli warns, &quot;Clearly, if Aegis systems are successfully deployed around China's periphery, then there is the possibility that China's ballistic missiles would be destroyed over their launch points.&quot;25 Ji Yanli, of the Beijing Aerospace Long March Scientific and Technical Information Institute, concurs: &quot;If such [seabased BMD] systems begin deployment in areas such as Japan or Taiwan, the effectiveness of China's strategic power and theater ballistic-missile capabilities would weaken tremendously, severely threatening national security.&quot;26 Somewhat problematically, the authors seemingly assume that Beijing would risk its strategic forces by deploying them closer to shore, and they forecast a far more capable Aegis fleet than is technically possible in the near term. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The indispensability of the ship-repair and maintenance facilities at Yokosuka emerges as another common theme in the Chinese literature</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. <strong>Analysts in China</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> often note that Yokosuka is the only base west of Hawaii that possesses the wherewithal to handle major carrier repairs. Some </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">have concluded that Yokosuka is irreplaceable</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>as long as alternative sites for a large repair station remain unavailable</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Li Daguang, a professor at China's National Defense University and a frequent commentator on naval affairs, casts doubt on Guam as a potential candidate, observing that the island lacks the basic infrastructure and economies of scale to service carriers.27 China's Jianchuan Zhishi (Naval and Merchant Ships) published a translated article from a Japanese military journal, Gunji Kenkyu (Japan Military Review), to illustrate the physical limits of Guam as a permanent home port for carriers.28 Chinese analysts also closely examine Sasebo, the second-largest naval base in Japan. Various commentators call attention to its strategic position near key sea-lanes and its proximity to China.29 As Yu Fan notes, &quot;This base is a large-scale naval base closest to our country. Positioned at the intersection of the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan, it guards the southern mouth of the Korea Strait. This has very important implications for controlling the nexus of the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan and for blockading the Korea Strait.&quot;30 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">It is clear, then, that Chinese strategists recognize the importance of U.S. naval bases in Japan for fulfilling a range of regional and extraregional responsibilities. Indeed, some believe that the American strategic position in Asia hinges entirely on ready military access to bases on the Japanese islands</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Tian Wu argues that without bases in Japan, U.S. forces would have to fall back to Guam or Hawaii. Tian bluntly asserts: </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">If the U.S. military was ever forced to withdraw from Okinawa and Japan, then it would be compelled to retreat thousands of kilometers to set up defenses on the second island chain</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Not only would it lose tremendous strategic defensive depth, but it would also lose the advantageous conditions for conducting littoral operations along the East Asian mainland while losing an important strategic relay station to support operations in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East through the South China Sea.31 This emerging discourse offers several clues about Beijing's calculus in regard to U.S. naval basing arrangements in Japan. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Chinese strategists see these bases as collectively representing both a threat to Chinese interests and a critical vulnerability for the U</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">nited <strong>S</strong>tates. Bases in Japan are the most likely locations from which the United States would sortie sea power in response to a contingency over Taiwan. At the same time, the Chinese are acutely aware of the apparent American dependence on a few bases to project power. <strong>Should access to and use of these bases be denied for political or military reasons, they reason, Washington's regional strategy could quickly unravel</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. While the commentaries documented above are by no means authoritative in the official sense, they are clearly designed to underscore the strategic value and the precariousness of U.S. forward presence in Japan. U.S. BASES IN JAPAN AND CHINESE MISSILE STRATEGY Authoritative PLA documents correlate with this emerging consensus that U.S. bases on the Japanese home islands merit close attention in strategic and operational terms. Indeed, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Chinese doctrinal writings clearly indicate that the American presence in Japan would likely be the subject of attack if the U</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">were to intervene in a cross-strait conflict. <strong>The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">unprecedented</span> public <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">availability of primary sources in China</span> in recent years <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has opened a window onto Chinese strategic thought</span></strong>, revealing a genuinely competitive intellectual environment that has substantially advanced Chinese debates on military affairs. <strong>This growing literature has also improved the West's understanding of the PLA</strong>. In an effort to maximize this new openness in China, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">this article draws upon</span></strong> publications closely affiliated with the PLA</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, including those of the prestigious Academy of Military Science and the National Defense University, that address coercive campaigns against regional bases in Asia.32 Some are </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">widely cited among Western military analysts as <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">authoritative works that reflect current PLA thinking</span></strong>. <strong>Some likely enjoy official sanction as doctrinal guidance or educational material for senior military commanders</strong>. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The authors</span> of the studies <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are high-ranking PLA officers who are either leading thinkers in strategic affairs</span> and military operations <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">or boast substantial</span> operational and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">command experience</span></strong>. <strong>These works, then, collectively provide a sound starting point for examining how regional bases in Asia</strong> might <strong>fit into Chinese war planning</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Among this literature, The Science of Military Strategy stands out in Western strategic circles as an authoritative PLA publication. The authors, Peng Guangqian and Yao Youzhi, advocate an indirect approach to fighting and prevailing against a superior adversary in &quot;future local wars under high-technology conditions.&quot;33 To win, the PLA must seek to avoid or bypass the powerful field forces of the enemy while attacking directly the vulnerable rear echelons and command structures that support frontline units. Using the human body as an evocative metaphor for the adversary, Peng and Yao argue, &quot;As compared with dismembering the enemy's body step by step, destroying his brain and central nerve system is more meaningful for speeding up the course of the war.&quot;34 To them, the brain and the central nervous system of a war machine are those principal directing and coordinating elements without which the fighting forces wither or collapse. The aim, then, is to conduct offensive operations against the primary sources of the enemy's military power, what the authors term the &quot;operational system.&quot; They declare, &quot;After launching the war, we should try our best to fight against the enemy as far away as possible, to lead the war to enemy's operational base, even to his source of war, and to actively strike all the effective strength forming the enemy's war system.&quot;35 In their view, operational systems that manage command and control and logistics (satellites, bases, etc.), are the primary targets; they relegate tactical platforms that deliver firepower (warships, fighters, etc.) to a secondary status. To illustrate the effects of striking the source of the enemy's fighting power, Peng and Yao further argue: To shake the stability of enemy's war system so as to paralyze his war capabilities has already become the core of the contest between the two sides in the modern hightech local war. So, more attention should be paid to striking crushing blows against the enemy's structure of the operational system . . . especially those vulnerable points which are not easy to be replaced or revived, so as to make the enemy's operational system seriously unbalanced and lose initiative in uncontrollable disorder.36 The authors are remarkably candid about what constitutes the enemy's operational system. Particularly relevant to this study is their assertion that the supply system emerges as a primary target: The future operational center of gravity should not be placed on the direct confrontation with the enemy's assault systems. We should persist in taking the information system and support system as the targets of first choice throughout. . . . In regard to the supply system, we should try our best to strike the enemy on the ground, cut the material flow of his efficacy sources so as to achieve the effect of taking away the firewood from the caldron.37 Destruction of the supply system in effect asphyxiates the adversary. In order to choke off the enemy's capacity to wage war, Peng and Yao contend, a &quot;large part of the supply systems must be destroyed.&quot;38 Their prescriptions for winning local high-tech wars suggest that the horizontal escalation of a conflict to U.S. regional bases in Asia is entirely thinkable. Even more troubling, some Chinese appear to envision the application of substantial firepower to pummel the U.S. forward presence. While The Science of Military Strategy should not be treated as official strategic guidance to the PLA, its conceptions of future conflict with a technologically superior adversary provide a useful framework for thinking about what a Chinese missile campaign against regional bases might entail. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">There is substantial evidence in Chinese doctrinal writings that PLA defense planners anticipate the possibility of a sizable geographic expansion of the target set, to include U.S. forward presence in East Asia</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Although the documents do not explicitly refer to naval bases in Japan, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">they depict scenarios strongly suggesting that Yokosuka is a primary target</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. In the hypothetical contingencies posited in these writings, U.S. intervention is a critical premise, if not a given. In particular, Chinese planners expect Washington to order the deployment of carrier strike groups near China's coast, a prospect that deeply vexes Beijing</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. It is in this context of a highly stressful (though by no means inconceivable) scenario that U.S. military bases come into play in Chinese operational thinking. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">For PLA planners, the primary aims are to deter, disrupt, or disable the employment of carriers at the point of origin, namely, the bases from which carriers would sortie</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. Given the limited capability, range, and survivability of China's air and sea power, most studies foresee the extensive use of long-range conventional ballistic missiles to achieve key operational objectives against U.S. forward presence</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In Intimidation Warfare, Zhao Xijun proposes several novel missile tactics that could be employed to deter the use of naval bases in times of crisis or war.39 Zhao proposes demonstration shots into sea areas near the enemy state to compel the opponent to back down. Zhao explains, &quot;Close-in (near border) intimidation strikes involve firing ballistic missiles near enemy vessels or enemy states (or in areas and sea areas of enemy-occupied islands). It is a method designed to induce the enemy to feel that it would suffer an unbearable setback if it stubbornly pursues an objective, and thus abandons certain actions.&quot;40 One tactic that Zhao calls a &quot;pincer, close-in intimidation strike&quot; is particularly relevant to missile options against U.S. military bases. Zhao elaborates: &quot;Pincer close-in intimidation strikes entail the firing of ballistic missiles into the sea areas (or land areas) near at least two important targets on enemy-occupied islands (or in enemy states). This enveloping attack, striking the enemy's head and tail such that the enemy's attention is pulled in both directions, would generate tremendous psychological shock.&quot;41 Zhao also proposes an &quot;island over-flight attack&quot; as a variation of the pincer strike. He states: For high-intensity intimidation against an entrenched enemy on an island, an island over-flight attack employs conventional ballistic missiles with longer range and superior penetration capabilities to pass over the enemy's important cities and other strategic targets to induce the enemy to sense psychologically that a calamity will descend from the sky. This method could produce unexpected effects.42 While these missile tactics are primarily aimed at coercing Taiwan, they could also, in theory, be applied to any island nation. Reminiscent of the 1996 crossstrait crisis, the PLA could splash single or multiple ballistic missiles into waters near Yokosuka (shot across Honshu Island, over major metropolitan cities) in the hopes that an intimidated leadership in Tokyo would stay out of a contingency over Taiwan, deny American access to military facilities, or restrict U.S. use of naval bases in Japan. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Should deterrence through intimidation fail, the Chinese may seek to complicate U.S. naval operations originating from bases located in the Japanese home islands</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The Science of Second Artillery Campaigns, the most authoritative work on the PLA's strategic rocket forces, furnishes astonishingly vivid details on the conditions under which China might seek to conduct conventional missile operations against outside intervention.43 Notably, the document explores &quot;firepower harassment&quot; as a potentially effective tactic to resist external interference. Given its explicit references to the U.S. use of military bases on foreign soil, a passage on harassment strikes is worth quoting in its entirety: When the powerful enemy uses allied military bases in our periphery and aircraft carriers as aircraft launch platforms to implement various forms of military intervention; and when the powerful enemy's allied military bases around our periphery are beyond our air arm's firing range, and when the carrier battle groups are far away from our shores, thus making it difficult to carry out the overall operational advantages associated with firepower coordination among the armed services and service arms, conventional missiles can be used to implement harassment strikes against the military bases of the enemy's allies around our periphery as well as the carrier battle groups.44 In other words, PLA planners intend to assign long-range strike missions to the ballistic missile force if warships, bombers, and submarines prove unable to reach enemy bases. Since U.S. bases in South Korea are well within reach of China's short-range ballistic missiles, shore-based aircraft, surface combatants, and undersea fleet, the &quot;allied military bases&quot; to which the study refers can only be those located in Japan. For the authors, harassment strikes might involve periodic missile launches into &quot;no go&quot; zones erected near the naval bases, in order to &quot;block the points of entry and exit to important enemy ports,&quot; or they might entail direct attacks against &quot;key targets within the enemy ports, such as fueling and fuel loading facilities, and logistical supply facilities.&quot;45 Such operations would be intended to disrupt seriously the resupply and movement of U.S. naval forces. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Beyond selective attacks, some <strong>Chinese analysts advocate highly destructive operations against U.S. military bases</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In a study on the PLA's blockade operations against Taiwan, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Chinese defense planners entertain the possibility of significant vertical and horizontal escalation to defeat U.S. intervention. The authors call for &quot;opportune counterattacks&quot; to defeat a carrier strike group engaged in combat operations against Chinese targets at sea, in the air, or on the mainland coast. In such a scenario, the PLA would do everything it could to successively weaken, isolate, and ultimately sink the carrier. In addition to lethal strikes against aircraft carriers, the authors envision concerted efforts to inflict massive damage on the military bases supporting carrier operations</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. According to Zhu Aihua and Sun Longhai, &quot;To punish the external enemy and to accommodate world opinion, it is not enough to sink the external enemy's aircraft carrier. . . . It is necessary to destroy the springboard of combat operations, to pulverize the operational bases, to cut off the enemy's retreat . . . in order to render obsolete hegemonism and power politics.&quot;46 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">It is clear, then, that Chinese strategists have systematically examined the strategies, doctrines, and operational concepts for dissuading, disrupting, and denying the use of U.S. military bases along China's periphery. These studies suggest that <strong>the PLA is prepared to calibrate the scale and magnitude of its military exertions against American forward bases across a spectrum that includes deterrence, compellance, and high-intensity conflict</strong>. It is equally evident that an extension of missile operations to the Japanese homeland is well within the bounds of Chinese planning. Should circumstances warrant, <strong>the PLA may not hesitate to escalate a crisis or conflict radically with missile salvos directed at Japan, to demonstrate political resolve, preclude Japanese involvement, or unhinge U.S. intervention</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. U.S. BASES IN JAPAN AND CHINESE MISSILES </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">A decade ago, Western analysts would have been on firm ground in dismissing such Chinese discussions about crippling U.S. regional bases as entirely wishful or even illusory. Indeed, they would have been justified in questioning Beijing's operational capacity to target U.S. bases in Japan even if it had possessed the will to do so</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. China simply could not have pulled off long-range, nonnuclear strikes beyond Taiwan. However, recent technical developments in the PLA's ballistic missile forces suggest that China is already in a position to fulfill at least the more limited missions elaborated above. If the pace of Chinese missile acquisitions continues, over the next decade Beijing will likely boast a formidable arsenal to shape events along the entire first island chain. The Pentagon's latest annual report to Congress on Chinese military power confirms the doctrinal writings surveyed in this study. According to the Department of Defense, PRC military analysts have also concluded that logistics and mobilization are potential vulnerabilities in modern warfare, given the requirements for precision in coordinating transportation, communications, and logistics networks. To threaten regional bases, logistics, and support infrastructure, China could employ SRBM/MRBMs [short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles], ground-launched LACMs [land-attack cruise missiles], special operations forces, and computer network attack (CNA).47 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The report identifies <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the DF-21</span></strong> medium-range <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">ballistic missile</span></strong> as an operational weapon system that <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could reach any location along the Japanese archipelago</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Concurring, the National Air and Space Intelligence Center states that &quot;China is . . . acquiring new conventionally-armed MRBMs to conduct precision strikes at longer ranges. These systems are likely intended to hold at risk, or strike, logistics nodes and regional military bases including airfields and ports.&quot;48 The exact size of the DF-21 force is not known in the public realm. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The Pentagon estimates that there are sixty to eighty DF-21 missiles</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>and from seventy to ninety associated launchers <strong>in the PLA's inventory</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.49 (The document does not distinguish between missiles armed with nuclear and conventional warheads.) The 2007 issue reports forty to fifty missiles and between thirty-four and thirtyeight launchers; </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the most recent report, therefore, represents <strong>a roughly 30 percent increase in two years</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.50 Ballistic and Cruise Missile Threat counts conventional DF-21 launchers as numbering fewer than thirty.51 The International Institute for Strategic Studies claims that thirty-six nonnuclear DF-21s are deployed, in two brigades.52 Interestingly, this figure is a new entry in the 2010 issue of The Military Balance; the previous tally lists only the nuclear variant, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">suggesting a much more rapid expansion of the conventional version than previously thought</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Since the missile's debut in the 1980s, the PLA has improved its accuracy, extended its range, and diversified the types of warheads it can carry.53 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">This emerging arsenal will likely play an important role in holding at risk or attacking U.S. regional bases</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.54 </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Several intervening factors are likely to influence the future size of the DF-21 inventory</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. First, <strong>China needs to build an arsenal large enough to overwhelm the ballistic-missile defenses fielded by the U.S.-Japanese alliance</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. As noted above, some Chinese analysts forecast a capable sea-based BMD system that could intercept theater ballistic missiles. Chinese strategists would almost certainly have to take into account some level of attrition arising from successful missile interceptions. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Second, <strong>some of the more destructive coercive options could trigger U.S. horizontal escalation</strong>, including conventional counterforce strikes against Chinese missile brigades on the mainland. <strong>Thus, strategists in Beijing must anticipate potentially severe losses should the U</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">expand its target set</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. These numerical factors suggest that the Second Artillery Corps will almost certainly need a much larger DF-21 missile force to engage in the types of high-intensity operations outlined in the doctrinal writings. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Observers may object that capabilities do not reflect intent. In other words, missile range, accuracy, payload, and force size by themselves constitute insufficient evidence of exactly what Beijing plans to hit</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Some may even find it implausible that China would attack a staunchly anti-nuclear-weapons state bound by a pacifist constitution, even if some of its real estate is occupied by a foreign military power. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Nevertheless, the historical pattern of Chinese missile deployments since the Cold War suggests that U.S. bases in Japan have always been primary targets for nuclear strikes</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In the 1960s the PLA extended the range of its first operational nuclear-tipped ballistic missile, the DF-2, to ensure that it could reach all American bases in Japan. Beijing deployed the follow-on missile, the DF- 3, near the North Korean border to cover targets on the Japanese home islands and Okinawa. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">If China had always intended to violate its negative security assurances- that is, pledges not to attack nonnuclear third parties-with city-busting warheads, it should not be surprising that Beijing would field conventional missiles for use against Japanese territory. Indeed, the DF-21 may represent a far less &quot;blunt&quot; instrument than its predecessors did and offer a somewhat &quot;surgical&quot; option to Chinese defense planners</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.55 CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF CHINESE MISSILE DOCTRINE </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">There are compelling reasons for the Chinese to consider vertical and horizontal escalation in coercive campaigns against regional bases in Asia</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. At the same time, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the PLA's missile force appears poised to extend its reach far beyond China's immediate periphery. <strong>The alignment of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Chinese aspirations and capabilities will complicate crisis management and stability, escalation control, and war termination in</span> the event of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">conflict</span></strong>. The gaps in Chinese doctrinal writings offer reasons to worry about these complications</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. First, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Chinese analysts seldom consider the mechanisms or chain of events that link the use of precision fire with the intended operational effects the PLA hopes to achieve</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. Most discussions assume or assert with certitude that the employment of certain missile tactics would induce a predictable set of American responses. But <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">closer examination suggests</span> that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">strategists</span> may <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have underrated the ability of U.S.</span> naval <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">forces to sustain operations</span> under severe duress, thus oversimplifying the action-reaction dynamic</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. For example, the wholesale destruction of fuel depots and logistical facilities would not likely have a direct or immediate impact on a carrier strike group either en route to or actively operating in a combat zone. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The U.S. Navy could surge additional carriers into the theater of operations and rush at-sea-replenishment vessels from Guam, Hawaii, and San Diego to the scene. Such work-arounds would cushion a devastating blow against logistical facilities in Japan, enabling U.S. operations to continue unimpeded</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. Indeed, <strong>many frontline units would not feel the effects of infrastructure damage in Yokosuka</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> or Sasebo </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">for many weeks</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In this scenario, China would likely have to settle in for a more protracted struggle. This potential outcome runs directly counter to the PLA's long-standing preference for quick, decisive victories at the operational level of war. Second, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">doctrinal publications exhort PLA commanders to maintain an offensive spirit and to seize the initiative in the opening stages of a military campaign. Indeed, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Chinese analysts insist that China should make the first move in any conflict</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. A crushing initial blow would throw the enemy off balance, enabling the PLA to dictate the tempo of the war. As the Science of Second Artillery Campaigns asserts, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">To &quot;strike the enemy at the first opportunity&quot; mainly refers to the need for the Second Artillery conventional missile force to act before the enemy, take the enemy by surprise, and attack the enemy when it is unprepared during its operational activities</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. It should be used first during the initial phase or at a certain stage of the campaign. . . . Therefore, in terms of campaign planning, it is necessary to launch attack before the enemy, strike first, and maintain the offensive intensity until the victorious conclusion of the campaign.56 </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">More troubling, Chinese strategists foresee the preemptive use of conventional ballistic missiles against the enemy's rear areas</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">: Using its advantages of concealment and surprise, active and intelligent response, and powerful penetration capability the missile force implements preemptive strike against the enemy's important in-depth targets. . . . Therefore, speedily striking the enemy, striving to seize the initiative, and avoiding losses are issues with which the campaign commander must first be concerned. It is necessary to strike the enemy at the first opportunity, before the enemy has discovered our campaign intentions and actions, surprise the enemy, act before the enemy, strike rapidly, catch the enemy by surprise</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.57 </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Given these operational parameters, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the Chinese might conduct a bolt-from-the-blue missile strike against vulnerable carriers</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>and warships anchored and at <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">pierside</span> to knock out the U.S. Navy</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.58 </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">An attack on a fleet in port would be akin to strikes against fixed targets</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. The impact-in terms of vessels sunk or damaged- would be direct, immediate, and relatively easy to measure</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The Imperial Japanese Navy's surprise attacks against the Russian fleet at Port Arthur and the U.S. Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor illustrate the logic of such a bold move. From a strictly operational perspective, preemption is highly efficacious. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">At the same time, Chinese planners acknowledge the need to balance tactical advantages against the potential international backlash arising from foreign perceptions that China had launched an unprovoked attack</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. PLA writings are acutely attuned to such moral and reputational considerations. Yet they offer no concrete guidance as to how to reconcile the emphasis on striking first with the broader strategic factors that would likely hold back policy makers in Beijing, the final arbiters of the weighty decision to order a surprise attack. This tension between operational expediency and political imperatives is left unresolved. A policy/strategy mismatch looms It is entirely conceivable that even at the height of a major crisis Chinese decision makers might recoil from the missile options presented to them. They could very well reject preemption out of hand as overly incendiary and politically counterproductive. A precedent in Sino-U.S. Cold War history is illustrative. During the 1958 Taiwan Strait crisis, American civilian leaders rejected the military's planned nuclear riposte to Chinese provocations, on the grounds that massive retaliation was out of proportion to the confrontation at hand. President Dwight Eisenhower firmly declined to consider recommendations by the Pacific Air Force to order tactical nuclear strikes against Chinese troops massed near Xiamen.59 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Whether PLA commanders are sufficiently attuned to national policy to anticipate similar civilian pushback or to appreciate the political rationales for restraint is unclear</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Third, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">escalation control will be a severe challenge for Beijing</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. Chinese writings exhibit an awareness of escalation problems associated with missile coercion. Analysts worry that misapplication of missile tactics could dramatically reshape the dynamics of the war, provoking greater exertions by the intervening power while widening the conflict, drawing in additional third parties</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. As Zhao Xijun warns, &quot;In conducting close-in intimidation strikes, one must maintain a certain distance from the enemy's border (sea area) line and select highly accurate missiles to prevent them from falling into enemy territory (or enemy occupied islands) or directly hitting the enemy's aircraft carrier owing to imprecision or loss of flight control.&quot;60 Zhao acknowledges that accidents or miscalculations that cross the bounds of intimidation could transform the nature of the conflict, to China's detriment. Suffering direct harm could harden an enemy's resolve substantially, immunizing him against subsequent attempts at intimidation. Concurring, The Science of Second Artillery Campaigns cautions, &quot;Commanders should cautiously make decisions, choose the appropriate opportunities, select high-precision missiles for precision strikes against key targets, and prevent missile firepower from deviating from the targets and giving others the excuse to permit the third country's participation in the military intervention.&quot;61 </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">An errant ballistic missile destined for the Yokosuka naval base could very well plummet into densely populated civilian areas surrounding the base or a major city along its flight path. It is conceivable that an aggrieved Japan would punish China by refusing to limit</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>(or even agreeing to expand) <strong>U.S. access to military bases on the home islands</strong>. Indeed, <strong>continued Japanese acquiescence to American use of military facilities might be enough to foil China's strategy</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">But Beijing faces even more daunting challenges than the writings let on. <strong>Chinese defense planners seem to assume that the Japanese leadership and the public would make a clear, objective distinction between targeted attacks against strictly military installations and wanton strikes against civilian population centers. Missile launches against Yokosuka would be an act of foreign aggression against the homeland unprecedented since the Second World War. It is hard to imagine the Japanese quibbling about the nature and intent of Chinese missile strikes under such circumstances</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">; the strident Japanese response to North Korea's Taepodong missile launch over the home islands in 1998 is a case in point. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In other words, <strong>the escalatory pressures are far stronger than the Chinese writings assume</strong>. Intimidation warfare will be neither clean nor straightforward. Indeed, <strong>it could unleash the forces of passion intrinsic to any war far beyond China's control</strong>. More broadly, <strong>PLA planners seem excessively confident</strong> <strong>that</strong> certain missile tactics would accurately telegraph Beijing's intentions. They assume that the precise application of firepower could send clear, discrete signals to the adversary in times of crisis or war. <strong>A small dose of well-placed missiles</strong>, they seem to believe, <strong>might persuade the enemy to back down</strong> or to cease and desist. This line of reasoning in part explains the counterintuitive logic that China could engage in escalation in order to compel its opponent to de-escalate</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The logic is as beguiling as it is potentially misleading. Missiles are not finely tuned weapons for those on the receiving end. The adversary may perceive what is intended as a warning shot or demonstration of resolve as a prelude to an all-out attack and then overreact rather than pausing or acting with caution. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The result</span></u></strong><strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>for the Chinese <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could be unanticipated</span> vertical or horizontal <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">escalation, </span>or both</u></span></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. <strong>Equally worrisome, operational interactions between Chinese and American forces could prove highly escalatory and destabilizing</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. As Evan Medeiros and coauthors astutely observe, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the operational doctrines on both sides share a proclivity for seizing the initiative at the outset of a conflict through surprise, speed, and attacks against enemy rear echelons</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Medeiros further argues: </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Neither body of doctrine appears to consider how an adversary might react to such operations in a limited war-indeed, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">each </span>seems to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">assume that it will suppress enemy escalation by dominating the conflict. Consequently</span> a Sino-American <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">confrontation would entail risks of inadvertent escalation</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> if military forces were permitted to operate in keeping with their doctrinal tenets without regard for escalation thresholds.62 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">It is clear, then, that an attack against regional bases is neither a trump card nor a substantially risk-free option. If plans go awry, as they always do in war, China could find itself in a protracted conflict against more than one implacable, well resourced enemy as intent as the Chinese upon achieving escalation dominance</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Whether Beijing would find the stakes over Taiwan or over another dispute sufficiently high to run such a risk is unclear. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Disturbingly</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, however, <strong>Chinese writings suggest that some segments of the PLA are inclined to accept the repercussions of a coercive campaign against U.S. bases in Japan</strong>. What explains this cavalier attitude about escalation? First, <strong>these writings may be symptomatic of a broad underdevelopment in coercion and deterrence theory</strong>. Chinese strategic theoreticians may still be grappling with the power and options that long-range conventional missiles confer on China. Beijing's analytical efforts to harness new military capabilities hitherto unavailable to it may be analogous to the growing pains that U.S. strategic thought underwent in the early years of the nuclear revolution. Second, <strong>the absence of hard-won experience from modern warfare and crisis could account for optimism about escalation control</strong>. The Chinese have not fought a war for over thirty years</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, since the Sino-Vietnamese border conflict. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Moreover, <strong>China has not yet confronted sobering incidents (comparable to the Cuban missile crisis) against which to reassess and radically revise prevailing assumptions</strong>. In short, <strong>it is easy to succumb to logical fallacies when operating in a theoretical vacuum</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Alternatively, Chinese overconfidence in managing escalatory pressures could reflect the lessons that defense planners learned from the cross-strait confrontation in 1996</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Some analysts in China have unequivocally concluded that the missile tests deterred the island from the road to independence while signaling clear redlines to the United States.63 </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The notion that a limited number of missile launches could produce far-reaching success in coercive diplomacy is a seductive narrative likely to attract adherents within the Second Artillery Corps. Indeed, such an uncritical story line could reinforce preferences, biases, and faulty assumptions underlying the discourse within the missile community</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Troublingly, The Science of Second Artillery Campaigns explicitly credits the missile tests in 1995 and 1996 for generating multiple studies that &quot;have filled in a blank in conventional guided missile operation theories of the Second Artillery Corps.&quot;64 A sample set comprising one case study is hardly a basis for universally applicable principles of war. Finally, the writings themselves may be a form of peacetime signaling. The studies clearly communicate to foreign audiences China's willingness to gamble in a big way in high-stakes disputes. If the doctrinal works convince outside powers that China may just be reckless enough to carry out the implied threats, they will have effectively cast a shadow of deterrence over potential adversaries. Mao Zedong's cunning efforts to deprecate the power of nuclear weapons-by famously depicting atom bombs as &quot;paper tigers&quot;-in order to signal Chinese resolve are instructive. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Any combination of these reasons should give pause to those inclined to dismiss the strategic significance of the doctrinal writings</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE U.S.-JAPANESE ALLIANCE </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Washington and Tokyo will encounter a more complex geometry of deterrence with the emergence of a robust Chinese theater-strike capability. The action-reaction dynamic in the United States-Japan-China triangle will be far less straightforward than that of the alliance's deterrent posture toward North Korea. The existential threat that U.S. conventional and nuclear superiority poses to Pyongyang is often presumed to be sufficient to deter the North's adventurism. Such is not the case with China. <strong>Boasting an increasingly survivable retaliatory nuclear strike complex, including a growing road-mobile strategic missile force and a nascent undersea deterrent, Beijing may be confident enough to conduct theater-level conventional missile operations under its protective nuclear umbrella</strong>. The war scares in the South Asian subcontinent over the past decade suggest that nuclear-armed regional powers, less inhibited by fears of enemy nuclear coercion or punishment, may feel emboldened to escalate a conventional conflict.65 <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Japan</span> and its many lucrative basing targets <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could well become a</span> conventional, theater-level <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">battlefield trapped between two nuclear-armed powers</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Assuming that vertical escalation toward nuclear use can be contained, the alliance must still consider efforts at denying attempts to punish Japan. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Allied <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">missile defenses</span>, as they are currently configured, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will have great difficulty coping with</span> theater ballistic missiles like <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the DF-21</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In the context of a cross-strait scenario, retired rear admiral Eric McVadon observes, &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Being an MRBM with a much higher reentry velocity than SRBMs, the DF-21C is virtually invulnerable to any missile defenses</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> Taiwan might contemplate.&quot;66 While the alliance possesses a far more sophisticated, multilayered missile defense architecture than does Taipei, longer-range missiles pose similar stresses to the defense of Japan. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">If the missiles were fired from launch sites in northeastern China, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">allied response times would be very compressed</span></strong>. <strong>Inexpensive techniques and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">countermeasures</span></strong> by the PLA, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">such as saturation tactics and decoys, could</span> be employed to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">overwhelm or defeat missile defenses</span></strong>, which are designed for less sophisticated regional threats from North Korea and Iran</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. If the Second Artillery Corps launched successive missile salvos against the same strategic site, the alliance could quickly exhaust its ammunition, constraining its ability to defend other targets. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Escalation control would also bedevil the alliance</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. One critical escalation threshold pertains to the initiation of hostilities were China to prepare for or launch its first missile strike. <strong>The allies would be very hard-pressed to distinguish confidently conventional missiles from nuclear-tipped missiles</strong>. Indeed, finding the missiles at all would be hard enough, since the road-mobile DF-21s would almost certainly disperse to a variety of concealed launch sites to diminish the threat of a disarming preemptive strike by enemy forces. <strong>To compound matters, Chinese conventional missiles might share the basing facilities with their nuclear counterparts</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Space-based surveillance and reconnaissance would provide at best an incomplete picture of China's wartime missile posture. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In short, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">no one would know</span> for sure <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">whether a Chinese warhead hurtling toward Yokosuka was</span> a <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nuclear or</span> a <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">conventional</span> weapon</strong>. <strong>The fog and friction that accompany any crisis or war would multiply this uncertainty</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Would the alliance be willing to discount the possibility that the launch could be a nuclear strike? Or would it assume the worst? In the event of Chinese conventional bombardment, what would be the appropriate military response from the United States? What might underlie and inform Japanese expectations of the U.S. reaction? Would the alliance be prepared to expand the war to the mainland? Would a besieged Japan demand more punitive strikes against China than the United States would be willing to inflict? Would Tokyo lose confidence in Washington if the latter refrained from what it considered disproportionate escalation? What would be the consequences of such a breakdown in trust during and after the conflict? These troubling questions make it imperative that Tokyo and Washington clearly recognize the operational temptations to overreact and the political consequences of underreaction. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Though prudence calls for restraint, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the stresses of crisis and war could radically skew rational calculations</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The foregoing analysis demonstrates that <strong>theater-level interactions involving conventional missile strikes against regional bases could be highly unstable and prone to miscalculation on all sides</strong>.

Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons.</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, <strong>there is little hope of winning a war against China</strong> 50 years later, <strong>short of using nuclear weapons</strong>. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. <strong>Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">.

Atsugi is located in a crowded urban area near Tokyo with little room between the runway and local homes. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The Navy is looking at options to move its 70 aircraft to another airbase in Japan</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. <strong>This will be extremely expensive and residents</strong> at potential sites <strong>are strongly opposed</strong>. <strong>The simple solution is to move those 70 aircraft</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> back to the USA, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">along with their assigned aircraft carrier</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, the USS George Washington</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. A carrier is based in Japan only because the U.S. Navy established bases there after World War II to contain communism. That threat ended, except for the small, weak state of North Korea. Japan has a first class military equal to China’s and doesn’t need American protection. South Korea has become a key trading partner with China. It has twice the population of North Korea and 50 times its economic power. Its mobilized <span style="color: black;">army is twice as big</span> and all its equipment is modern, compared to North Korea’s untrained and ill equipped peasant force. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In the rare chance that war breaks out, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the airbase at Atsugi is a prime target for missile attack</span></strong>, which is another reason local residents want the Americans to leave</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The Navy claims an aircraft carrier is needed for regional security, yet it routinely deploys the USS George Washington to the Persian Gulf region for six months. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">There are almost a hundred modern airfields in Japan and Korea where American aircraft can operate in time of war</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, so <strong>an aircraft carrier and the Atsugi airbase are unneeded</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Finally, the old Taiwan-China conflict has mostly disappeared. China never had the naval resources to even consider <span style="color: black;">invading Taiwan</span>. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Downsize U.S. Naval Base Yokosuka</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, Japan <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The U.S. Navy has 11 aircraft carriers</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">: five are homeported at Norfolk, Virginia, three are at San Diego, two in Washington State, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">and one is based near Tokyo for no rational reason.

An obvious new homeport for the USS Washington battle group is Mayport, Florida. The aircraft carrier based there was decommissioned in 2007, and a dozen frigates based there will soon be scrapped. The Navy plans to move a Norfolk based aircraft carrier there in 2014 to balance the fleet. This has resulted in <span style="color: black;">a political battle</span> between Congressmen since business leaders in Virginia say the move will cost them 11,000 jobs and $600 million in annual spending. Amazingly, no one mentions </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the solution is to <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">move the aircraft carrier from Japan, where it is</span> costly to maintain</strong>, not wanted by the Japanese, <strong>and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">vulnerable to surprise attack</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Remember Pearl Harbor? Mayport is far more popular with Navy families and is the same distance from the Middle East as a carrier based in Japan. The Navy and Marine Corps have eliminated a dozen squadrons this past decade because of soaring costs, so there is room at existing airbases to accommodate the aircraft from Atsugi.</span></span><br />

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">Allahpundit <span style="color: black;">laid down the gauntlet</span> with this question on China’s new anti-carrier weapon, the Dong Feng-21D ballistic missile: Exit question for military (preferably naval) readers: Big trouble here or overblown? Answer from this naval reader: both. Perhaps “overblown” isn’t the right expression, so much as “blown by rogue winds and widely misunderstood.” Allow me to explain. The DF-21D isn’t a weapon we have no defenses against. In fact, the US Navy’s Standard Missile (anti-air missile) program and ballistic missile defense (BMD) upgrade to the Aegis tracking and guidance system are the right defenses to deal with it. Much is frequently made of how fast the DF-21D would be approaching its target in the terminal phase, but the gee-whiz aspect of that is overblown: it’s a ballistic missile. Of course it comes down really fast at the end. That’s what they do. The US has been working on ballistic missile defenses, afloat and ashore, for nearly 30 years now; the speed at which they plummet toward the earth is not a surprise. We have also proven our ability to intercept ballistic missiles coming down at high speeds from extra-atmospheric apogees – although here our success has been slow, and proven mainly in controlled test conditions. Almost all of the just-above-50% success rate has been achieved in the last decade (looking only at the last decade’s testing, the success rate is more like 80%). That said, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">a ballistic missile coming down at a carrier is a different and faster-moving problem than an anti-ship cruise missile coming at a carrier. Most of the cruise missiles out there (which fly like airplanes) are subsonic, and therefore relatively easy to shoot down</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The supersonic Russian-designed SS-N-22 Sunburn (or MKB Raduga) missile is an exception, and China does have that missile, as a weapon system on Sovremenny-class destroyers purchased from Russia. (I note that cruise missiles aren’t the best weapon to use against a carrier anyway; they’ll be more likely to be used against escort ships and merchants.) </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">But the geometry of the ballistic missile problem is in a class of its own. That’s <strong>what makes the DF-21D a potential game-changer</strong>: the fact that the geometry of the problem, and <strong>the defensive tactics it would require, impose significant operational constraints</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Let me open that discussion with the observation that the fundamental significance of any of this will depend heavily on how effective the DF-21D’s terminal guidance is. Unless China wants to just lob warheads out there to plop harmlessly in the ocean, the DF-21D will have to have a form or forms of effective terminal guidance. Ships are moving targets, and for a ballistic missile, close will mean no cigar. The DF-21D will reportedly have multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs), unquestionably complicating the defensive picture, but the likelihood of any individual hit will be extremely low without hard-to-evade guidance. There’s a good discussion on that <span style="color: black;">here</span>; the hardest guidance to evade is infrared (IR) homing, followed by radar homing. Supposing China can make the DF-21D home on targets to a level 50% as good as “perfect,” and supposing our own missile defenses function better with each passing year, we have a difficult but bounded problem. And </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the big problem is not that we can’t defend our carriers at all, it’s that defending them would levy so many constraints on our operations</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. In effect, the DF-21D is a harassment weapon, and a darn good one, if it works as it’s intended to</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Our carriers don’t carry ballistic missile defenses</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, for starters. <strong>The Aegis ships</strong> – cruisers and destroyers – <strong>would have to defend them</strong>. To some extent we already operate that way; a carrier is virtually never without an Aegis escort when it’s deployed forward. But one is generally deemed enough; against enemy attack aircraft or cruise missiles, the carrier’s own defenses are effective and will catch close-in threats that slip through the Aegis net. The carrier can defend itself from air threats with its fighter aircraft and short-range anti-air missiles – but these aren’t defenses against ballistic missiles. <strong>If <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">China </span>can launch a barrage of MIRVed DF-21Ds, she <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">can bog us down defending the carrier – or</span> simply <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">push us further offshore</span></strong>. But <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the further offshore we have to operate, the more vulnerable our carriers’ aircraft</span> are when they are approaching targets on land</strong>. <strong>It’s not just the distance over which China has a shot at them, it’s that plus the fact that they will have to refuel in-air</strong> to get to the target and then back to “Mom” (the carrier). <strong>The threat of a DF-21D barrage would also be a fouling agent for carrier flight operations. The most vulnerable time of all is when aircraft are being recovered</strong> at the end of a mission cycle. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The Chinese know that</span></strong>. Naturally, <strong>they will time DF-21D salvos to coincide with recovery ops</strong>. When you’re trying to bring down 16 or 20 jet aircraft safely, <strong>you can’t keep changing course and speed and turning your electronics on and off</strong>. <strong>The carrier has to be a safe recovery platform for her aircraft, otherwise there’s no point</strong> – and that’s the highest-payoff vulnerability for an enemy to go after</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. If the DF-21D is mainly a nuisance, these issues can be addressed in the medium term with tactics, while we look for longer-term fixes in technology. But the DF-21D will be only one of the disruptions a naval force faces. It’s probably not going to be a very effective way to literally “kill” a carrier for some years to come. A submarine nailing the carrier at the keel is a much better bet: take out propulsion, you take out the whole weapon system. Without propulsion, the carrier can’t make the 35 knots of wind over the deck that it needs to recover aircraft. And China has lots of submarines. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">It’s the combination of weapons China can increasingly bring to bear that the US Navy is worried about. If we’ve got one big, honking set of tactical constraints imposed by the Chinese submarine threat, another posed by the Chinese attack aircraft threat, and another posed by supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">adding the DF-21D as a</span> flight-ops <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">harassment problem makes it that much harder for our forces</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>to keep their heads above water: <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to use our weapons to actually attack the enemy, rather than just to defend ourselves</span></strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. (And yes, George and Meredith Friedman, authors of <span style="color: black;">The Future of War</span>, called this prospect for our carriers “senility,” and predicted it in theory, if not because of the particular threat posed by the DF-21D, back in the mid-1990s.)</span></span><br />

The Carrier Killer: DF-2ID Missile In 1995-96 China was forced to back off when the US dispatched two Carrier battle groups to the Taiwan Straits at the height of the Chinese generated crisis. China had then aggressively fired missiles over Taiwan and staged amphibious assault exercises. The approach of the Carrier Battle Groups forced China to back down. China had thereafter toned down its rhetoric and truculence for over 10 years. However its military and Naval Brass was intensively engaged in finding an answer to the challenge of US Carrier Battle Groups. The response has now come in the form of the DF-2ID Ballistic Missile. This is a mobile land based missile of 1800-2000 miles (approx 3,000 kms) range, specifically designed to engage and destroy the giant nuclear powered carriers. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The DF-2ID has US Naval Strategists clearly worried. The US Navy concedes privately that they have only theoretical counter measures against the DF-2ID because its trajectory and other capabilities are largely unknown. As <strong>per US Naval Intelligence sources the DF-2ID is nearing operational capability</strong>. It could rank as the worlds first mobile land based missile <strong>capable of hitting a moving aircraft carrier nearly 2000 miles away</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The basic design of the DF-2ID is quite similar to the US Pershing II Missile of the Cold War era. However it is a land based platform. Its payload and the capability of a ballistic Missile to redirect in mid-flight is what especially worries US Strategists. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">What drives the</span></u></strong> <u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">recent <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">aggressive assertiveness of the Chinese Navy?</span></strong> Is it <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">its confidence that it finally has an answer to the</span> US <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Carrier</span> Battle Groups</strong>?</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> The US Navy 7th Fleet Commander, Vice Adm John Bird was clearly concerned when he said, “We have some concerns over the very aggressive weapons the Chinese are processing”. “Individually”, said Paul Giarra (a former Navy Cdr and now a Defense Deptt Analyst) “the technological capabilities are not unprecedented but it is a revolutionary combination of capabilities”. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The missile would be formidable during battle and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">its consequences go beyond</span> any <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">hypothetical cataclysmic wars</span></span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The Chinese would use the missile as leverage to</span> try to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">weaken US Security pledges to Taiwan and other Asian allies, establishing vast no-go zones in the</span> West <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Pacific</span></strong>. An active Dong-Feng 21D Missile arsenal could prove to be a significant threat to the massive nuclear powered air craft carriers</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This “carrier killer” could usher in a major revolutionary change in Naval warfare which had moved from the era of Battleships to the era of Aircraft carriers in World War II. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The DFs mark a significant paradigm shift that could make the strategy of sending giant Air craft carriers more dangerous because it could give China the option of firing warning shots if the US Ships sail too close for Chinese comfort</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> says Toshi Yoshiwara; Prof of Strategy and Policy at the US Naval War College. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">A small dose of well placed missiles they believe might persuade the enemy to back down</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>or cease and desist. Such escalation <strong>could lead to miscalculation</strong>. If fired upon, <strong>the US might perceive what is intended as a warning shot</strong> or demonstration of resolve – <strong>as a prelude to all out attack</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Current US Defensive Measures </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The current US Missile defense systems are based on the US Aegis class Cruisers/destroyers that form part of an Air Craft Carrier Battle Group. These carry the SM-3 interceptor missiles. However</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> Giarra noted that </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the interception capability of Aegis equipped ships is not enough to reliably defend against a volley of well placed Anti-ship missiles</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. The US option therefore would be to rely more upon submarines</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> or else keep its surface ships out of missile range. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">This seems to explain the surprising rise in Chinese Naval assertiveness</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. B Raman has rightly pointed out that </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">China seems to be asserting itself more and more <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">with respect to</span></strong> the kinds of <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">territorial claims</span></strong>. They seem to be <strong>taking <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a much more aggressive approach to</span> near sea areas recently. This has serious implications for the freedom of navigation on the high seas</strong>. It virtually amounts to the enforcement of maritime exclusion zones</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. What is highly surprising is what precisely has impelled America to back down and hold its Naval Drill in the Sea of Japan, instead of the Yellow Sea. Was it the threat of the DF-21D? A Chinese military analyst wrote lately that “The rise of Chinese Naval Power is unstoppable. Instead of trying to counter it the US should accommodate itself with it by accepting the new reality in the Western Pacific as a result of the rise of the Chinese Navy”. Beijing now has an expanded list of core sensitivities that go far beyond Taiwan and Tibet. The North Korean Response The North Korean response has been equally strident. It had threatened to unleash a sacred war and a nuclear response. North Korea’s National Defense Commission gave an unprecedented warning from a nuclear armed nation. “The Army of the People of North Korea will legitimately counter with their powerful nuclear deterrent the largest ever nuclear – war exercises”. The virulence of the collective Chinese – North Korean response has apparently worried the Americans enough to shift the venue of the exercises from the Yellow Sea to the Sea of Japan. Admiral Mike Mullen’s Concern In his recent visit to India, US Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen clearly articulated his growing concern over China’s recent Naval assertiveness and muscle flexing. Beset with a financial crisis and bogged down with ongoing insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Obama Administration’s first impulse after coming to office, was to seek accommodation with China at the global level and alliance with Pakistan at the regional scale. India was completely marginalized from its world view and pilloried to make peace with Pakistan. Obama’s visit to China however was a significant come down. Chinese assertiveness in the climate change negotiations further convinced the Americans that China only respected strength. They retaliated by providing $ 6 Billion worth of arms to Taiwan. This entrained a negative cycle that is now manifesting in the crisis in East Asia and the increasing Naval muscle flexing by China. The Americans are clearly concerned and Admiral Mullen articulated this concern unambiguously in his visit to India. He stated inter alia “I have moved from being curious about what they are doing to being concerned about what they are doing” He elaborated “I see a fairly significant investment in high end equipment, satellites, ships and Anti- ship missiles and high end aircraft. They are shifting focus from ground forces to a focus on their Navy and Air Force”. He also stated significantly that “China is massing expeditionary maritime and air capabilities which seem oddly out of step with their stated goal of territorial defense”. He was of the view that “Every nation has a right to defend itself and spend as much as it deems fit for that purpose. But a gap as wide as what seems to be forming between China’s stated intent and its military progress, leaves me more than curious about the end result”. In Oct 2009 Gen Xu Caihai, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of China had visited the USA. He was taken to several bases stretching from the East Coast to Hawaii. This gave US officials hope that it was the beginning of a normalization period between the two militaries. However in Jun 09, the US sold over $ 6 Bn worth of arms to Taiwan and the whole process ground to a halt. Mullen had then stated “China is a leader in the region – a rising leader. We welcome its considerable strength and potential. The Question is should China and US work together, lead together, to promote regional stability? Mullen had the said “Washington’s answer is and has been an unequivocal yes. Beijing’s answer has been sometimes yes and sometimes no”. Things have apparently changed in 2010. With the Beijing Olympics China threw its coming of age party. The Global financial crisis found America considerably weakened. China sensed its break out opportunity and in 2010 there has been a dramatic turn around from its “Hide your capabilities bide your time” phase. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Its military build up has given new confidence and assertiveness to the PLA the PLAN and the PLAFF. <strong>The DF-2ID seems to have exorcised the threat of American Carrier Battle Groups and introduced a significant game changer in the Naval arena of the Western Pacific</strong> Ocean. China is now flexing its muscles. <strong>China’s recent attempt to virtually enforce maritime exclusion zones in <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the South China Sea</span>, East China Sea and the Yellow Sea <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">forms a very disturbing precedent. It has obvious implications for</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">freedom of navigation on the high seas</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This obviously concerns the USA and it equally has implications for India. It is hoped that Mike Mullen’s visit to India will correct the blatantly pro-Pakistan distortions that had crept into the American regional perspective. In a rising and assertive China, both India and the USA face a common threat and challenge. The Democratic administration before long may have to revive the idea of a concert of democracies. The Global Financial Crisis is being seen by the Chinese as a significant game changer that has hastened its coming of age as a global power. The pattern shift in Chinese state behaviour has serious implications for Asia and the World in general and India in particular. Indian National Security experts need to take serious note of these tectonic plate shifts and speed up our inordinately delayed military build up. We can not afford to post pone the completion of our military buildup to 2025. The crisis situations are building up far quicker than anticipated in Asia. We can not afford to be overtaken by events once more. Paradigm Shift in Naval Warfare </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The Dong Feng -2ID Ballistic Missile as a Carrier killer could generate a Naval RMA. It could have a huge impact on the way Navies fight</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. India has invested in a major way in acquiring tactical to mid sized air craft Carriers. It must factor in the impact of the DF-2ID threat to its CBGs. India has developed considerable expertise in developing autarky in missiles. The DRDO must rapidly produce such Carrier Killer Ballistic Missiles as also defensive systems against such attacks on our own CBGs. It is ushering in a new era in Naval Warfare and we can not afford to be left behind. The Carrier Killer Ballistic Missile is a significant game changer. It is also cheap and affordable and the earlier we acquire this capability the better it will be for us. We also need to invest in countering this new threat – otherwise our own CBGs will have to be confined to harbours in future Naval Battles. The rate and pace of change is accelerating in our times. We have no option but to keep pace.</span></span><br />

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">AT A 23 JULY 2010 MEETING of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum, an ASEAN-plus-three conclave which tackles a range of security issues, US Secretary of State Hilary </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Clinton stated that <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the South China Sea</span></strong> was “pivotal to regional stability”</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. China’s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, responded by saying that internationalising the issue (an approach long opposed by Beijing) will simply make resolution more difficult. The People’s Liberation Army Navy (</span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">PLAN</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">), China’s military service most concerned with developments in the region, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">subsequently underlined China’s new, aggressive stance when it conducted exercises in the Sea in early August 2010</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Clinton's comments follow an increase in bilateral tensions owing to China’s perceived unwillingness to act forcefully to control its errant client state, North Korea, after the sinking of the South Korean corvette, the Cheonan, in March 2010. They also follow China’s own branding of the South China Sea as a “core interest” that same month, thereby setting it, at least in rhetorical terms, alongside other non-negotiable issues such as Xinjiang, Tibet and Taiwan. Relations had been flagging since the Obama Administration’s November 2009 decision to permit the sale of a US$6 billion arms package to Taiwan. Efforts to improve links since then have foundered, suggesting that the differences between the two powers are becoming increasingly structural, and the joint South Korean and US naval exercises in the Yellow Sea in late July 2010 have merely hardened sentiments. Frozen Island Claims </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The dispute has two main dimensions. The first is an essentially bilateral dispute between Vietnam and China over possession of the Paracel Islands</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, the sea’s northernmost island chain, which is wholly under Chinese military control. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The second is the much more complex dispute over claims to the Spratly Islands by a number of littoral states including Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Various islands in the chain are under the control of the disputants’ armed forces, with China, the Philippines, and Vietnam all maintaining permanent structures on certain islets</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The legal bases of these claims are, for the most part, quite weak. Chinese and Vietnamese claims to the Paracels stem from historical use. Hanoi’s argument is that the French government administered both archipelagoes during the colonial period, and that their inclusion in maps of Vietnam dates back to the 18th century. In turn, China’s counterarguments for possession of the Paracels are based on historical use, maritime law, and geographical proximity. For the Spatlys, Vietnam and China claim historical use, akin to their claims to the Paracels. Malaysia and Brunei rest their claims on their reading of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the Philippines’ claims stem both from UNCLOS and geographical proximity. Efforts to resolve the crisis have done little more than freeze it. The departure of Soviet maritime forces after 1989 from the Cam Ranh naval base in Vietnam facilitated talks on the issue, which led in 1992 to the Manila Declaration on the South China Sea. This was followed in 1995 with a bilateral agreement between the Philippines and China on a Code of Conduct for oil exploration in the South China Sea. The latter agreement did not prevent Beijing from taking control of an atoll called Mischief Reef inside the Philippines Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in 1996. ASEAN nonetheless took the agreement as a model for a future, regional Code of Conduct. Subsequent talks led to a 2002 Declaration on a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea, which is the prevailing international legal instrument on the issue. It is, however, nonbinding and essentially amounts to little more than a statement that all parties will comply with the relevant international legal principles, including the UNCLOS, the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (to which China became a signatory in 2003 and which prohibits the use of force in the region). The improved political climate since 2002 yielded few dividends. A 2005 Joint Maritime Seismic Undertaking (JMSU) between China, the Philippines, and Vietnam was tainted by two issues: accusations in the parliament in Manila that the Macapagal administration agreed to the JMSU in exchange for bribes from China; and suggestions from Filipino parliamentarians as well as from Hanoi that China was using the initiative to gain strategic information. Efforts to tackle the issue started to wane; the JSMU lapsed in 2008, in response to growing tensions most closely linked to China’s 2007 announcement that it had incorporated the administration of the South China Sea into Sansha County in Hainan province. Beijing returned to its default position that any discussions on this issue must take place on a bilateral and not multilateral basis. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">A Growing Risk Of Conflict There are compelling economic-strategic considerations behind the dispute. The islands straddle one of the world’s busiest waterways: <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">over 60% of the world’s</span> maritime <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">trade passes through</span></strong> it, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">including 80% of Chinese oil</span> imports</strong>. <strong>The</strong> South China <strong>Sea is also one of the world’s richest fisheries</strong>, accounting for about 10% of the global fish catch, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and it is thought to contain significant resources of oil and gas</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Strategic arguments focused on military defence and force projection are perhaps the most compelling. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">From <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">China’s</span></strong> perspective, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">control</span></strong> of the South China Sea <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would allow it to exert pressure on the Japanese and Taiwanese economies</span></strong>, which rely on supplies transported via regional sea lanes, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and keep the Indian Navy bottled up in the Indian Ocean</span></strong>, thereby neutralizing a regional threat to China’s littoral. It would also extend the reach of its naval assets into the Straits of Malacca – well beyond the ranges dictated by current maritime jurisdictions and force projection capabilities. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">It is precisely this</span> sort of regional <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">ascendancy the other littoral states wish to prevent</span></strong>. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The risk of conflict is real and growing</span></strong>. Fishermen from all disputants are routinely arrested and even shot</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Vietnam and China have a history of animosity owing to Vietnam’s depiction of China as its ancestral enemy, as well as more recent tensions related to Hanoi’s invasion of Cambodia in 1978 and China’s response to it, a punitive war against Vietnam in 1979. The South China Sea issue remains a key source of acrimony between the two states despite improved relations in recent years. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Vietnam has started to increase its naval capacity, buying new corvettes and frigates, most notably</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> in December 2009 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">when Hanoi bought six diesel/electric Kilo class submarines from Russia. The move by Hanoi followed similar acquisitions by Malaysia, which is another disputant, and Singapore</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, which is not. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Notwithstanding its overt naval superiority over the other disputants, China is thus increasingly alive to the threat these submarines present to its sea lanes</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. US Intervention </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Washington</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> had hitherto sought to stabilise conditions in the South China Sea, but appeared to depart from this stance when it </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">recently increased its naval presence in order to ensure freedom of navigation. In turn, increased US activity angered China, and in early 2009 a standoff involving water cannon took place between the USS Impeccable</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, a submarine hunting vessel, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">and five Chinese flagged ships. A similar if less publicised event took place again in March 2010</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Vietnam has actively sought US support in any stand-off with China, and </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Clinton’s comments</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, which </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">amount to an overt declaration that the US has a right to intervene in the issue</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, seem a partial validation of Hanoi’s strategy. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">China’s increased aggression</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, then, appears to have <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">provoked the US into pursuing a strategy of South China Sea containment</span></strong> or even roll-back. The US has a range of incentives to do so. First, it has a strategic role to play <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">as a security guarantor to</span> smaller regional <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">powers</span></strong>, such as Malaysia and Vietnam, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">which fear Chinese expansion</span></strong> in the region – thereby preserving the US-led ‘hub and spoke’ system of bilateral security accords in the Asia-Pacific. Second, the US Navy has an operational interest in maintaining situational awareness of China’s growing submarine capacity</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> – especially since the expansion of the Sanya base on the island province of Hainan into a platform for China’s ballistic missile armed submarines. Washington has hitherto been careful not to label its efforts “containment”, proclaiming instead its determination to cooperate with China in part because of its need to engage with China on a range of issues, including its US debt holdings. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">China</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, naturally enough, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">resents US intrusion</span> in what it sees as its immediate neighbourhood</strong>. In this context, <strong>what had seemed <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a local flashpoint is increasingly acquiring an international dimension</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, resembling, the even more intractable and flammable Korean peninsula. More broadly US policy appears to be shifting towards an unspoken strategy of containment, if developments in the South China Sea and the Korean peninsula can be taken as accurate indicators. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Accordingly, the US relationship with Vietnam and other South East Asian states may in time become bellwethers for the state of bilateral relations between Beijing and Washington, since containment in the South China Sea starts in Hanoi and Kuala Lumpur. In the interim, <strong>the risk of</strong> friction and <strong>conflict in the region is growing</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">China’s Carrier Trap You’ve likely heard of the carrier-killing ballistic missile we feared is being deployed by China, specifically targeting the USN’s most valuable warships. <span style="color: black;">Dr. Andrew Erickson </span>of the Naval War College, writing in Wired’s Danger Room blog tells us of official confirmation: Last week, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Adm. Robert Willard, the head of U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), made an alarming but little-noticed disclosure. China, he told legislators, was “developing and testing a conventional anti-ship ballistic missile based on the DF-21</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">/CSS-5 [medium-range ballistic missile] </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">designed specifically to target aircraft carriers</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.” What, exactly, does this mean? Evidence suggests that China has been developing an anti-ship ballistic missile, or ASBM, since the 1990s. But </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">this is the first</span></u> <span style="color: black; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";">official confirmation that it has advanced</span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (.pdf) </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">to the stage of actual testing</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Now </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">some would want us to send more of our highly visible flattops to the region, playing into the PLAN’s anti-access strategy</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. With ongoing buildup of the naval base at Guam it seems the admirals agree with this strategy, which sounds much like moving Pearl Harbor 1941 a few thousand miles closer to Japan. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A better idea would be to build a larger fleet of less noticeable vessels</span></strong>, submarines and small ships, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">which can disperse and reform when needed</span>. Our own version of the swarm</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.  * What? Me Worry? Craig Hooper refuses to swoon over the Chinese ballistic missile threat to the flattop. Here he writes in the recent <span style="color: black;">Proceedings mag</span>: In May 2009, urgently worded accounts of contemporary Chinese antiship ballistic-missile (ASBM) developments exploded onto a number of mainstream U.S. media outlets, sparking a domestic uproar. But by unintentionally validating China’s as-yet-unproven ASBM capabilities, these well-intended warnings did America’s strategic position in the Pacific Basin few favors… America must stop casting itself as the primary target of a Chinese ASBM. Even if the antiship version of China’s medium-range DF-21 ballistic missile materializes and proves to be fully operational, accompanied by reliable, well-integrated targeting, guidance, and command systems, there are too few conventional antiship DF-21D variants available to pose an immediate hazard to U.S. carriers. Government estimates suggest the inventory of nuclear- and conventionally-armed DF-21/CSS-5 missiles is still manageable, expanding from 19 to 23 in 2004 to a moderate-sized fleet of 60 to 80 missiles. It is, today, hardly an inventory sufficient to defeat a well-defended U.S. carrier battle group. Let me also say, that </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">even if the ASBM capability proves a failure, this is yet another threat to the carrier’s dominance of the sealanes</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> since World War 2. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">And as the threats grow numerous, it seems our answer has been to build fewer and ever larger flattops to compensate</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. I personally suspect the death-watch on the carrier began in 1954, and the launch of the first nuclear powered submarine. Since then there has been a gradual <span style="color: black;">dismantling of our ASW capabilities</span>, hastened by the fall of the Soviet Union. If that wasn’t bad enough, starting in the 1960s, they began adding stand-off ship killing cruise missiles to these super-stealthy and fast as a destroyer platforms, making an already amazing weapon even more lethal. Yet </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the ultimate threat to the aircraft carrier is</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>not a military one, but <strong>its own</strong></u> </span><strong><span style="color: black; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif";">bloated pricetag</span></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>and the costs and complication of its specialized naval aircraft. This is a concurrent problem for all navies seeking to deploy last century naval airpower in the age of the guided missile and UAV</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.  * The F-35B is really cool say Marines The concern was the new V/STOL version of the Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35B, would melt the carrier deck it would launch from. Colin Clark reports from <span style="color: black;">DoD Buzz</span>: The STOVL version of the Joint Strike Fighter is not too hot and is not too loud, Marine Commandant Gen. James Conway told DoD Buzz during an editorial board session. The most troubling operational challenge that appeared to face the F-35B, next to weight, was reports that it would not be suitable for a carrier or other ship because its exhaust would melt the flight deck. Not so, Conway told reporters from Military​.com. The plane, at 1,500 degrees, is just 18 degrees hotter than a Harrier, he said Thursday. I hope he’s right, as the current Harrier vertol is getting long in the tooth. But the need for vertical airpower seems as dire as ever.  * The “E” doesn’t stand for “Easy” The ongoing saga to beat the dead horse and get a little more life out of the ancient USS Enterprise hit another pothole, says Peter Frost at the <span style="color: black;">Daily Press</span>: The “Big E” is becoming the <span style="color: black;">U.S. Navy</span>‘s “Big $.” The Navy this week agreed to spend an additional $13.2 million for maintenance on the USS Enterprise, pushing the cost to repair the fleet’s oldest aircraft carrier to nearly $655 million — 44.5 percent higher than the original estimate. It’s the 11th time in 21 months the service has had to throw more money at the 49-year-old carrier to prepare it for two final deployments before a scheduled 2012 decommissioning. Why does this story remind of the Indian Navy’s own attempts at keeping the equally ancient <span style="color: black;">Hermes/Viraat </span>viable for a few more years?  * Scraping to Keep the Fleet Fit Speaking of aging platforms, the Navy is trying desperately to avoid a “fighter gap” by keeping war-weary Hornets in the skies as long as possible. Reporting at <span style="color: black;">Jacksonville.com</span>, here is Timothy Gibbons: The original F/A-18s, known as Hornets, are mainly at or beyond their expected life span, and even the newer Super Hornets are running into trouble with metal fatigue. Meanwhile, the F-35, the plane that’s expected to replace the older Hornets, is getting more expensive and taking longer than planned to come online. That has led the Navy to consider asking Boeing to start building Super Hornets again. Dealing with the reality of an aging fleet — a situation recently thrown into sharp relief by the Navy’s need to ground 104 jets to check for cracks in their fuselage — has fallen on the shoulders of Fleet Readiness Center Southeast. Now, workers there are delving deeper into the guts of the aircraft than the manufacturers ever expected, leading artisans to ramp up production on products they must craft from scratch. “We’re looking at areas no one ever intended us to be looking at,” said F/A-18 division director Major Nimock. They’re doing a great job, but seems to be only delaying the inevitable. Unless we can replace platforms on time, ordering new ones as needed, we could realistically see further shrinkages in the carrier airwing.  * That Was #4 on the List of Alternatives Andrew Oh-Wilekke, the <span style="color: black;">Washington Park Prophet</span>, sees land-based USAF planes as an alternative to aircraft carriers in the Gulf: There is a very good chance that the U.S. could now secure a permanent Air Force base in the region similar to those in Aviano, Italy or Okinawa, Japan, and will have something like 50,000 U.S. troops in Iraq for the foreseeable future in any case. In the past, this might have been seen as a threat to Iraq or other Arab states. Now, it would be seen merely as a precaution against Iranian military action that would disrupt the oil trade in the Persian Gulf. It wouldn’t take a very large Air Force base to have superior capabilities to an aircraft carrier, and this kind of base could also be home to the Navy’s land based P-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft. Some smaller U.S. Navy ships might still remain in the Persian Gulf, but freed of force protection for an aircraft carrier as a primary mission, far fewer navy surface ships would be required. I agree with that in part. Naturally </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">if you had land based airpower on call, there would be little reason to deploy high end battleforce vessels like carriers and Aegis warships. However you would still need smaller vessels like corvettes and patrol ships which can do boarding, search-and-seizures, and at-sea rescues. So, with force multipliers like land-based air, you can actually build a larger, though lower cost fleet</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">If the Navy could grasp</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> ahold of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">this concept, a few superships and many low tech vessels, much of their current presence deficits</span>, overdue-deployed crews, the amazing shrinking fleet <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would be turned around</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">The idea of massed airwings of the type carried by </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>typical Nimitz class <strong>supercarrier is</strong> actually <strong>making us weaker with the appearance of great strength</strong>. When this becomes your only answer for world problems, it greatly limits your capability and effect</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. For instance, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">a show of force with a carrier strike group against a Third World nation appears almost farcical, because of the great difference in strength between the two powers</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. A rogue dictator knows the US must either deploy this force at its full strength or not at all, and given the world attitude against war on weaker nations, the defiant potentate knows he is mostly secure. The dramatic takedown of a Saddam Hussein or Manuel Noriega is such a rare occurrence as to be unlikely, the dictator feels secure enough when the carrier withdraws for other duties, he quietly breathes a sigh of relief, and publicly claims a great victory of standing down the American colossus. The old David versus Goliath scenario, which is very effective for propaganda purposes. The huge size of a supercarrier, with so much national treasure packed inside, plus the very exquisite planes and warships required to defend it, means for a massive and unnecessary drain on America’s resources. More expensive ships and their long building times means American shipyards spend an excessive amount of time on fewer warships. Fewer ships built means less work, which is the primary cause of the demise of the US shipbuilding industry. Our apparent great strength then has a ripple effect across the entire Navy, ensuring it remains small, less flexible, and with fewer shipbuilding resources in case of war. This makes us less prepared for the future, not more. It is also a very wasteful way to deploy power at sea. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The admirals use the argument that larger carriers are better because they carry more firepower than so-called less capable small carriers, but this dated idea bears scrutiny</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> in </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">considering advances in technology</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The 1980 airwing of the USS Nimitz was far less capable than the 2000 airwing, the addition of precision guided munitions making a dramatic difference. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Packing all this incredible technology in a few large packages, keeping it concentrated rather than dispersed where it is needed makes it less effective. We are weak even with the appearance of great strength. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">If</span></strong>, however, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">you spread</span> the new <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">capability out, in smaller carriers, or</span> with <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">missile ships</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, or land based planes, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">you could do more missions</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>with the seemingly “less capable” airwings</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. You wouldn’t be bound by the 10 or 11 platforms you can afford, a handful of this forward deployed at any given time, requiring equally pricey escort warships, and 5000+ crew to operate. With small carriers, this should satisfy the fear that we need carriers to support land troops ashore. Besides, these days Marines and Army soldiers carry much of their own aerial power in the form of V/STOL planes, the aforementioned UAVs, and even loading <span style="color: black;">drones in backpacks </span>as part of their kit. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Mindful also that carriers should never operate <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in range of missiles</span>, suicide boats, mines, or stealthy midget subs</strong>, against which <strong>we don’t need to risk our largest, most expensive warships</strong> anyway</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Recall that <span style="color: black;">supporting the land battle </span>is secondary to the Navy’s primary role of sea control. Do we want to gear all of our precious resources toward a secondary naval mission, or will the fleet get serious about sea control, instead of continuing to trust in nuclear shield, that no one will shoot at our carriers? The admirals will tout the amazing flexibility of their multi-billion dollar superships. On land, our warfighters are thinking of how many missions they can get out of individual aircraft, and UAVs are very able as well given their long-loitering persistence. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In the very near future one or two <strong>drones will do the missions we now launch giant fleets and their tens of thousands of crew to perform</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Not just fantasy, its very nearly here. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Because this new capability is so effective, less is more</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, but hulls are the life of any fleet. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Get more hulls and you can project this new power in many places</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. Power concentrated is power wasted. You also must <strong>consider that the loss of a single</strong> such <strong>immense</strong> fighting <strong>ship</strong>, carrying so much of your total strength, <strong>you also lose a great amount of your firepower</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. During the world wars, carriers suffered grievous attrition in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters. Recall Admiral Cunningham in the Mediterranean Theater, often down to a single carrier, many times with none. Compare this to the old battleship navy which depended greatly on numbers, with Nelson at Trafalgar forced to fight with one ship, or Jellicoe at Jutland so lacking!  * </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Another cause for the carrier’s being the weak link in the fighting fleet, is their large size and vulnerability. <strong>Even the Navy now admits their biggest ships are at risk from</strong> a relatively simple off the shelf weapon</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, howbeit with advanced new guidance systems. Earlier this year comes the following testimony before the House Armed Services Committee by <span style="color: black;">Admiral Robert F. Willard, Commander</span>, U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM): </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">China is also developing and testing a conventional anti-ship ballistic missile based on <strong>the DF-21</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">/CSS-5 MRBM </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">designed specifically to target aircraft carriers</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Having grave implications, according to <span style="color: black;">Andrew S. Erickson</span>, at Associate Professor at the Naval War College: What does this mean for the U.S.? If developed and deployed successfully, a Chinese ASBM system of systems would be the world’s first capable of targeting a moving carrier strike group from long-range, land-based mobile launchers. This could make defenses against it difficult and/or highly escalatory. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">While the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Navy</span> is taking <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">steps to combat the Chinese carrier killing missiles</span>, this <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will entail the concentration of even more force</span> to guard the highly visible platforms</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, putting at risk the same vessels which potentially do the same mission. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">By keeping the missile escorts tied to the at-risk and redundant carriers, we are placing these valuable assets at risk as well</span></strong>. <strong>Also</strong>, by keeping the new battleships bound with the now obsolete carriers, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we lose the flexibility of the long-range and easily dispersed Tomahawks to ensure the fleet’s survivability</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Remember that in 1941 the faster and longer-ranged naval airpower (200+miles) were still tied to the slow moving and short-ranged guns (20+ miles) of the battlefleet in the US Navy, and you can see the discrepancy today. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">We have all the fighting power we need with lower cost <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">missile ships, submarines and light carriers</span>, which <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">should be dispersed in roles where we now use only supercarriers</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. These should be supported in their mission by smaller Influence Squadrons consisting of motherships, corvettes, OPVs, attack craft, which are </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">less vulnerable in shallow waters</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, especially geared for this role as they are, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and affordable enough to build in large numbers</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. For the Navy, they would be the “lighter footprint”, a tactic which the ground troops have used to great success in our wars and peacekeeping operations ashore.</span></span><br />

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">Despite this consensus on what we are trying to explain, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the question of what causes war can mean several different things</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Suganami 1996). It can refer, first of all, to </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the question of what makes war possible, to the permissive or logically necessary conditions for war. These fundamental or <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">primary causes of war</span></strong> <strong>explain why war</strong> repeatedly occurs in international politics, why war <strong>can occur at any moment</strong>. Thus <strong>scholars trace war to human nature, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">biological instincts</span>, frustration, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">fear and greed</span>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the existence of weapons</span>, and similar factors</strong>. <strong>Peace, however, is far more common than war</strong>, though as a “non-event” peace is difficult to measure</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. At the systemic level there may be more years characterized by war than by peace, but in nearly all war years most states are at peace, and at the dyadic level war is rare (Bremer 1992). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">This makes it hard to argue that human nature and related factors are causes of war. <strong>The point is that these factors <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are constants and cannot explain</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">variations</span> in war and peace <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">over time and space</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Waltz 1959, Cashman 1993). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">If human nature varies, as some argue, then it is the sources of that variation, not human nature itself, that explain behavior. Moreover, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">even if</span></strong> human nature or biologically based <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">instincts could explain aggressive behavior at the individual level, they cannot explain when such aggression leads to domestic violence, when it leads to scapegoating</span></strong> or other outlets, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">when it is resolved, and when it leads to international war</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The question of how to explain variations in war and peace is the second meaning of the broader question of what causes war. Why does war occur at some times rather than other times, between some states rather than other states, under some political leaders rather than others, in some historical and cultural contexts rather than others</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, and so on? This differs from still a third question: How do we explain the origins of a particular war? Most international relations scholars (and particularly those in North America) focus primarily on the second question, explaining variations in war and peace. They leave the question of why war occurs at all to philosophers and biologists and leave the question of why a particular war occurs to historians. This is not to pass judgment on the relative importance of the three questions, only to say that they are different and that their investigation may require different theoretical orientations, different conceptions of causation and explanation, and different methodologies. One important exception to this focus on variations in war and peace is the argument by Waltz (1979) and other neorealists that the fundamental cause of war is the anarchic structure of the international system. Anarchy, defined as the absence of a legitimate governmental authority to regulate disputes and enforce agreements between states, “causes” war in the sense that there is no governmental enforcement mechanism in the international system to prevent wars.5 Although anarchy may provide one persuasive answer to the question of the permissive causes of war, it is generally treated as a structural constant and consequently it cannot account for variations in war and peace. Waltz (1988, p. 620) seems to concede this point and argues, “Although neorealist theory does not explain why particular wars are fought, it does explain war’s dismal recurrence through the millennia.” Other neorealists also recognize this limitation and have begun to incorporate other variables, including the polarity of the system and the offensive/defensive balance, in order to explain variations of war and peace in anarchic systems. Another exception to the focus on variations in war and peace can be found </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">in some feminist theorizing about the outbreak of war</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, although most feminist work on war focuses on the consequences of war, particularly for women, rather than on the outbreak of war (Elshtain 1987, Enloe 1990, Peterson 1992, Tickner 1992, Sylvester 1994). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The argument is that the gendered nature of states, cultures, and the world system contributes to the persistence of war in world politics. This might provide an alternative (or supplement) to anarchy as an answer to the first question of why violence and war repeatedly occur in international politics, although the fact that peace is more common than war makes it difficult to argue that patriarchy</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (or anarchy) </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">causes war</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Theories of patriarchy might also help answer the second question of variations in war and peace, if they identified differences in the patriarchal structures and gender relations in different international and domestic political systems in different historical contexts, and if they incorporated these differences into empirically testable hypotheses about the outbreak of war</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This is a promising research agenda, and one that has engaged some anthropologists. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Most current feminist thinking in political science about the outbreak of war, however, treats gendered systems and patriarchal structures in the same way that neorealists treat anarchy, as a constant.and consequently it cannot explain variations in war and peace</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The Levels-of-Analysis Framework Ever since Waltz (1959) classified the causes of war in terms of their origins in the individual, the nation-state, and the international system (which he labeled first-, second-, and third-image explanations, respectively), international relations theorists have agreed on the utility of the levels-of-analysis framework as an organizing device for the study of war and international behavior more generally. Some scholars have modified Waltz’s framework by collapsing the individual and nation-state levels to create a simplified dichotomy of nation (or unit) level and system level (Singer 1961, Waltz 1979), while others have disaggregated the nation-state level into distinct governmental and societal-level factors (Jervis 1976, Rosenau 1980), a practice that I follow here. Following Waltz (1959), most scholars use the levels of analysis as a framework for classifying independent variables. This leads to such questions as whether the causes of war derive primarily from the level of the international system, national societies or bureaucracies, or individual decision-makers. Although the question of which level is most important has stimulated useful debate, until recently it distracted attention from the equally important issue of how variables from different levels interact in the foreign policy process. The levels-of-analysis concept is sometimes used differently, to refer to the dependent variable, or to the type of entity whose behavior is to be explained. In this sense the systemic level of analysis refers to explanations of patterns and outcomes in the international system; the dyadic level refers to explanations of the strategic interactions between two states; the national level refers to explanations of state foreign policy behavior; the organizational level refers to explanations of the behavior of organizations; and the individual level refers to explanations of the preferences, beliefs, or choices of individuals. The failure of scholars to be explicit about exactly how they are using the levels-of-analysis concept is a source of confusion in the field. Some have erroneously interpreted Singer.s (1961, p. 92) comment that the various levels “defy theoretical integration...[and] are not immediately combinable” to suggest that analysts should not combine variables from different levels of analysis to explain foreign policy decisions or international outcomes. But Singer.s statement makes sense only if the levels of analysis are conceptualized in terms of the dependent variable. This is the familiar micro-macro problem of aggregation across levels. We cannot assume that correlations or causal connections at one level of analysis are necessarily valid at another level. It is conceivable, for example, that concentrations of power may promote peace at the dyadic level but war at the system level. This has important implications for theories of war and peace. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Although it is possible that individual- or national-level variables could be the primary causes of war, these variables do not constitute a logically complete explanation because they do not explain how individual beliefs and preferences are translated into state decisions and actions or how the strategies or behaviors of states interact to lead to war as a dyadic or systemic outcome</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. To the extent that most wars involve the mutual and interactive decisions of two or more adversaries, an explanation for the outbreak of war logically requires the inclusion of dyadic- or systemic-level variables. This does not necessarily mean, however, that these variables are the most important in terms of amount of variation explained. The levels-of-analysis framework is not the only way to organize the literature on the causes of war or on international politics more generally. It has long been fashionable for international relations theorists to frame debates in terms of the so-called paradigm wars between realism and liberalism (Baldwin 1993). In contrast to the realist focus on the struggle for power and security in an anarchic and conflictual Hobbesian world, the liberal tradition sees a more benign Grotian international society or Lockean state of nature where anarchy does not imply disorder. States have common as well as conflictual interests, aim to maximize economic welfare as well as provide for security, and create international institutions that help regulate conflict and promote cooperation (Keohane 1989). Although the paradigmatic debate between realism and liberalism has imposed some order on a chaotic field, it distracts attention from significant variations within each paradigm, variations that often lead to conflicting hypotheses. It also detracts from the important task of systematically integrating key components from each approach into a more complete and powerful theory. Furthermore, the “paradigm wars” ignore important hypotheses associated with the Marxist-Leninist tradition and saddle liberalism with charges of the neglect of power that are better associated with the utopianism of Thomas Paine and others (Walker 1998). As a field, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">international relations needs to</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>shift its attention from the level of paradigms to the level of theories, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">focus on</span> constructing theories and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">testing</span> them <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">against</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">empirical evidence</span></strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, and leave the question of whether a particular approach fits into a liberal or realist framework to the intellectual historians. THEORIES OF THE CAUSES OF WAR Systemic-Level Theories The realist tradition has dominated the study of war since Thucydides, and includes Machiavellians, Hobbesians, classical balance of power theorists, Waltzian neorealists, and hegemonic transition theorists.6 Although different realist theories often generate conflicting predictions, they share a core of common assumptions: The key actors in world politics are sovereign states that act rationally to advance their security, power, and wealth in a conflictual international system that lacks a legitimate governmental authority to regulate conflicts or enforce agreements. For realists, wars can occur not only because some states prefer war to peace, but also because of unintended consequences of actions by those who prefer peace to war and are more interested in preserving their position than in enhancing it.7 Even defensively motivated efforts by states to provide for their own security through armaments, alliances, and deterrent threats are often perceived as threatening and lead to counteractions and conflict spirals that are difficult to reverse. This is the “security dilemma,” the possibility that a state’s actions to provide for its security may result in a decrease in the security of all states, including itself (Jervis 1978). Realists do not assume that international relations are always conflictual, and they have recently focused on the question of the conditions for cooperation under anarchy, often through the use of iterated Prisoner.s Dilemma models (Jervis 1978, Axelrod 1984, Grieco 1990). The iterated models are more appropriate for most situations than single-play Prisoner.s Dilemma models, and the iterated Prisoner.s Dilemma framework has generated some useful hypotheses regarding the rather restrictive conditions under which cooperation is likely. The assumption that the same game is repeated over and over is often problematic, however, particularly for security issues, because one play of the game (preemption, for example) can significantly change power relationships and affect payoffs in the next iteration. Nor is it clear that unilateral defection is always preferred to mutual cooperation; stag hunt models, in which mutual cooperation is both sides. first preference, may be more applicable in many situations (e.g. where each side fears both war and preemption by the other). There has been a tendency to apply Prisoner.s Dilemma models to many situations in which the assumptions of the model are not satisfied. The core proposition of realist theory is that the distribution of power, throughout the system or within a dyad, is the primary factor shaping international outcomes. But different versions of realist theory generate different, sometimes contradictory explanations and predictions of foreign policy choices and international outcomes, based on different assumptions about the motivations of states, the nature of power, and the identity and boundaries of the system. Given the variety of realist propositions and predictions, it is possible to interpret nearly any foreign policy behavior or international outcome as consistent with some version of realism. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">This is not particularly helpful, for <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">if theories are not falsifiable they have little explanatory power</span></strong>. We should treat realism as a paradigm rather than as a theory, and focus instead on specific theories that generate more determinant, testable propositions. The key division in the realist literature on war is</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> not the standard one between classical realism and neorealism8, but rather </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">between balance of power theory and hegemonic theory</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Balance of power theory includes numerous variations on the classical realism of Morgenthau (1967) and the more systemic structural realism of Waltz. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Hegemonic theory is a structural theory that incorporates power transition theory and hegemonic stability theory and that downplays the importance of anarchy</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Balance of power theory posits the avoidance of hegemony as the primary goal of states and the maintenance of an equilibrium of power in the system as the primary instrumental goal. The theory predicts that states, and particularly great powers, will balance against those states that constitute the primary threats to their interests and particularly against any state that threatens to secure a hegemonic position.9 Balance of power theorists argue that the balancing mechanism.which includes both external alliances and internal military buildups.almost always successfully avoids hegemony, either because potential hegemons are deterred by their anticipation of a military coalition forming against them or because they are defeated in war after deterrence fails. In balance of power theory, serious threats of hegemony are a sufficient condition for the formation of a blocking coalition, which leads either to the withdrawal of the threatening power or to a hegemonic war. Balance of power theory is more concerned with explaining national strategies, the formation of blocking coalitions, the avoidance of hegemony, and the stability of the system than the origins of wars, which are underdetermined. All balance of power theorists agree that some form of equilibrium of military capabilities increases the stability of the system (generally defined as the relative absence of major wars), and that movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing because they trigger blocking coalitions and (usually) a hegemonic war to restore equilibrium. There is a major debate, however, between classical realists, who argue that stability is further supported by the presence of a multipolar distribution of power and a .flexible. alliance system (Morgenthau 1967, Gulick 1955), and neorealists, who argue that bipolarity is more stable than multipolarity (Waltz 1979, Mearsheimer 1990). Although neorealists rely heavily on polarity as a key explanatory variable, they do so with very little supporting evidence. They overgeneralize from the Cold War experience, where bipolarity is confounded with the existence of nuclear weapons and other key variables, and fail to demonstrate the validity of their arguments with respect to earlier historical eras. Although bipolarity is less common than multipolarity, it has occurred before, as illustrated by the Athens-Sparta rivalry in the fifth century BC and the Habsburg-Valois rivalry in the early sixteenth century, both of which witnessed numerous wars. Neorealists also ignore a number of quantitative studies that suggest that bipolarity is no less war-prone than multipolarity, that wars occur under a variety of structural conditions, and that polarity is not a primary causal factor in the outbreak of war (Sabrosky 1985). An important alternative to balance of power theory is </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">power transition theory, a form of hegemonic theory that shares realist assumptions but emphasizes the existence of order within a hierarchical system</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Organski &amp; Kugler 1980, Gilpin 1981, Thompson 1988). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Hegemons commonly arise and use their strength to create a set of political and economic structures and norms of behavior that enhance the stability of the system while advancing their own security</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Differential rates of growth, the costs of imperial overextension, and the development of vested domestic interests lead to the rise and fall of hegemons, and </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">probability of a major war is greatest</span> at the point <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">when the declining leader is being overtaken by the rising challenger</span></span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">. <strong>Either the challenger initiates a war to bring its benefits from the system into line with its rising military power or the declining leader initiates a “preventive war” to block the rising challenger while the chance is still available</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Levy 1989b, pp. 253.54). The resulting hegemonic war usually generates a new hegemonic power, and the irregular hegemonic cycle begins anew. Power transition theorists disagree somewhat on the precise identity of hegemonic wars and the particular causal dynamics from which they arise; for comparisons of the wars and critiques of the theories see Levy (1985) and Vasquez (1993). Although many of the theoretical analyses of power transition theory focus on transitions between the dominant state in the system and a challenger, and include conceptions of a broader international system and hierarchy, some applications of power transition theory are dyadic in nature and apply in principle to any two states in the system. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>dyadic-level “<strong>power preponderance</strong>” <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">hypothesis</span>, which holds <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">that war is least likely when one state has a preponderance of power over another</span> and is most likely when there is an equality of power, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has received widespread support in the empirical literature</span></strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Kugler &amp; Lemke 1996).</span></span><br />

If defensive realism did not fail to take into account rising powers, then its prescriptions would prove similar to offensive realist ones. This is because for defensive realists, much depends on the nature of the situation: policies required when a status quo power faces an expansionist power are very different from the changes that could increase cooperation among status quo powers that fear one another. When dealing with aggressors, increasing cooperation is beyond reach, and the analysis and preferred policies of defensive realists differ little from those of offensive realists who see much less room for cooperation. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Aggressors may be deterred or defeated but given that the security dilemma is intractable, additional information about transaction costs or offence-defence balance cannot lead to changes in preferences over strategies</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Jervis 1999:52). Indeed, when faced with aggressors, defensive realist policies should resemble those of offensive realists. This very important point has been confirmed by Jervis when he said …for defensive realists, diagnosis of the situation and other’s objectives is a crucial and difficult step, which explains why analysts of this type come to different policy prescriptions if they have different views of the adversary (Jervis 1999:52).<a class="wiki_link" href="/Full%20Text%20Highlighted%201AC%20-%20GDS#_edn5">[v</a>] </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Misdiagnoses can have disastrous consequences</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>in the realm of state security</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This is most evident in defensive realism’s failure to take adequate account of the effect of rising or non-status quo powers on the security environment. When US policy-makers continue to formulate policy based around defensive realist predictions for an offense-dominant environment they are misapplying defensive realism to the region. For although </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">these predictions</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> recognise offense-dominant environments, they apply only to situations in which all states are security seekers. They </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">cannot account for non-status quo or greedy powers</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This continued misapplication of defensive realism has resulted in a dangerous distortion of US foreign policy which maybe ultimately harmful to US national interests. Assessing state motivation: how to distinguish a revisionist power </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Offensive realists claim that motivations are unobservable and hence security seekers will never know if they face security seekers or not. States treat all states alike, and seek relative power as proxy for security</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This completely ignores the possibility of signaling intentions. Defensive realists on the other hand, assert that the search for security does not always cause conflict because state motivations can sometimes be signaled under certain favourable conditions. The central focus is therefore on the offence-defence distinction. When security favours the defence, security seekers will favour defensive weapons while aggressive powers will choose offensive weapons. It is for this reason that Charles Glaser terms it ‘contingent realism’ (Glaser 1994-95). Kydd argues that neoclassical realists overestimate the difficulty of assessing state motivation. While he looks at modern democratic states in particular, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">it is possible to derive two criteria <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to assess</span></strong> any state’s <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">motivation</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. These include: 1) </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">preference revelation; and</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> 2) </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">costly signals</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Kydd 1997:129-151). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">These criteria will be used to assess whether common perceptions of China as a rising and dissatisfied power are indeed accurate. In modern democracies the policy process is so transparent that the first criteria, preference revelation, is easy to satisfy</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. It is relatively simple to decide if the state is a security seeker or otherwise (Kydd 1997:129-139). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">This <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is not</span></strong> so <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">simple in a</span></strong>n <strong>authoritarian</strong> and <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">closed</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> <strong>state such as the PRC</strong></span> that does not believe in transparency, electoral processes or public information. It is for this reason that realists claim <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">capabilities should be the guide</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Nevertheless, even authoritarian, non-democratic states can use ‘costly signals’ to reinforce messages about their preferences as benign security seekers. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">This is not to say that aggressive states do not seek to persuade others that they are security seekers</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Hitler’s protestations of lack of territorial ambition after each new conquest are the classic example of this. Hence </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">rhetorical statements in and of themselves are of little help</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. However, statements in conjunction with reassurance signals can be effective. For example, a state might be considered aggressive because its leadership propounds an extreme, intolerant and messianic ideology. Such states are often feared by their neighbours because of the suspicion that they might want to impose their ideological systems upon them. For states that are perceived as aggressive for this reason, ideological moderation might be persuasive in signaling benign intent (Kydd 1997:141). For example, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">should China renounce the right to use force to solve the Taiwan issue, or even move to a more democratic domestic ideology, this might signal that China is a security seeker and not an irredentist power</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.<a class="wiki_link" href="/Full%20Text%20Highlighted%201AC%20-%20GDS#_edn6">[vi</a>] It could also decrease tensions occasioned by China’s extraordinary levels of economic growth. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Nevertheless, <strong>to date <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">China</span>’s strategic behaviour indicates that it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is diverting substantial resources</span></strong> away from its primary strategic interest – its land borders – <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">towards naval power projection</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (You &amp; You 1991; You 1999). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Furthermore, in its recent White Paper on the ‘One China’ policy, the PRC reaffirmed its willingness to use force, and indicated its increasing impatience and displeasure with Taiwan’s attempts to stall reunification talks</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (PRC 2000)<a class="wiki_link" href="/Full%20Text%20Highlighted%201AC%20-%20GDS#_edn7">[vii</a>]. While it did not undertake missile tests similar to those during the 1996 Taiwanese elections during the March 2000 elections, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the PRC’s <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">inflated rhetoric, in combination with</span> its <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">increasing</span> strategic <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">capabilities</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>could in fact <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">signal that it is moving away from being a status quo power</span></strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Another method of signaling</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>motivation or <strong>intention is</strong> a state’s <strong>policy towards weaker states</strong>. Aggressive states will often want to dominate neighbouring states</u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, if not physically, then perhaps politically. By respecting the autonomy of weaker states, and freedom within its acknowledged sphere of influence of the state, a security seeking power can signal that it is uninterested in conquest and domination for its own sake (Kydd 1997:143). </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Territorial disputes</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> involving China are</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;"> <u>among <strong>the region’s most intractable, with Taiwan, the Senkaku and Spratly Islands valued far beyond any economic or strategic value they hold</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. A central reason for this dominance is that territorial claims are central to the re-legitimisation efforts of the current post-Deng regime. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Consequently, it is possible to view <strong>actions <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">such as</span></strong> China’s passing of the 1992 Ocean Law restating <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">its claim to the entire South China Sea</span></strong> as designed to promote China’s comprehensive national power and gratify nationalist aspirations by shoring up territorial and sovereignty disputes</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (You 1995:390; Forney &amp; Yatsko 1998; Khalilzad et al 1999:9). Similarly, the PRC’s occupation of Mischief Reef in 1995 can be viewed in an internal context (Tiglao 1994:20-21; Tasker 1995; FEER 1995:5). Nevertheless, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">these actions <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have</span> only <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">served to heighten US perceptions of an expansionist and disruptive China</span></strong>. While it is possible that these perceptions may be overstated, it is apparent that China is increasingly determined to maintain its hold on territory already claimed</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. As discussed above, the offence-defence balance provides another method of signaling intention since decision-makers often draw inferences about an adversary’s intentions from its military posture. They frequently assume that the arms of others indicate aggressive intentions. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The offence-defence balance in East Asia has been effected in recent years by two developments. First, <strong>pre-<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">existing US perceptions of China as threatening have been heightened by the offensive nature of</span> China’s military <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">acquisitions</span></strong>. Many weapon systems recently acquired have a strike capability, are for long-range operations, and include rapid force projection capabilities</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (You &amp; You 1991; You 1995: 382-385; Shambaugh 1996; Zeng 1996:13; Simon 1998:67; You 1999:105). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Further <strong>improvements to PRC <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">ballistic missile</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> <strong>and</strong></span> strategic <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nuclear</span></strong> warhead <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">capability</span></strong> are also foreseen</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Galen Carpenter 1998:9). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Moreover, these offensive weapons platforms <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are accompanied by an offensive force doctrine</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. For example, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is being restructured from a fundamentally defensive force to a force with both defensive and offensive capabilities (You 1999:105). In addition, the fact that </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">most modern weapons can be simultaneously offensive and defensive, depending on the intention with which they are used, means that differentiation is difficult</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> <a class="wiki_link" href="/Full%20Text%20Highlighted%201AC%20-%20GDS#_edn8">[viii</a>], </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">which tends to favour the offence since <strong>states favour worst case planning ‘to be on the safe side’</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. The second development that has altered the offence-defence balance has been the debate within the US over deployment of missile defences. While defensive realists argue that defensive systems should not provoke arms races and spirals of tension, this logic is less applicable in contemporary East Asia. Many in the region, particularly in Beijing, fear that new defensive roles for Japan, including co-development, and co-deployment of TMD, could break important norms of self-restraint, leading to more comprehensive Japanese military buildups at a later stage, and fueling pre-existing Chinese-Japanese tensions (Christensen 1999:51; Daalder, Goldgeier &amp; Lindsay 2000:15; Gill &amp; Mulvenon 2000:3; Manning, Montaperto &amp; Roberts 2000). Although technology appears to have given offence the advantage, it must be noted that the PLA’s ambitious doctrinal desires presently lie in sharp contrast to its severely limited capabilities. It is thought that the PLA’s current weapons inventory remains twenty to thirty years behind the state-of-the-art in almost all categories, although efforts are being made, particularly as regards air power (Shambaugh 1991:16; Shambaugh 1996; You 1999). This is due to the low priority given to military modernisation prior to the 1990s. It is thought that China will lack the airlift and sealift capability vital for power projection and rapid deployment from probably two decades or more (Shambaugh 1991:16). Consequently, while China has an offensive force doctrine, its offensive capability will remain limited, and consequently offence will not have the advantage, at least in the short to medium term (You 1999:111). Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider geography, the other factor that determines the balance and hence the intensity of the security dilemma. Christensen (1999 &amp; 2000) believes that the geography of the East Asian region will intensify the security dilemma. However, it is arguable that this represents a misapplication of the theory. Ross argues that this very same geography, which he characterises as a bipolar division into maritime and continental spheres of influence, will in fact dampen tensions (Ross 1999). For example, the Taiwan Strait stalemate is formed by mutual conventional deterrence: the mainland deters Taiwan with its land power, and the United States deters China with its maritime power. Because the theatre is defence dominant, the risk of war is minimal. On balance I would argue that this characterisation is too simplistic, and that </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the history of distrust evident between China and Japan, and Japan and South Korea will ensure that the geography of the region incites, rather than depresses tensions</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In sum, I have argued that despite difficulties in offence-defence differentiation and offensive acquisitions in China, over the long-term, offence will gain the advantage. This does not send positive signals to the region about China’s intent, or the possibilities of regional stability. China is a rising power As mentioned above, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">uncertainty about whether the other state is motivated by security or greed will increase the adversary’s insecurity, which in turn will reduce the state’s own security. <strong>Since <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">this drives worst-case foreign policy</span></strong> analysis and formulation, <strong>realists, and indeed common sense, suggest that states should be very interested in demonstrating to others that their motives are benign</strong>. Consequently, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in the absence of any signal to the contrary, and</span></strong> arguably <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">many signals that it is indeed expansionist</span>, it is logical for <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">policy makers</span> to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">assume</span> that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">China is a rising and dissatisfied power</span></strong>. This very conclusion is the reason that regional actors view with concern the rise of Chinese power</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Friedberg 1993-94). The insecurity engendered by these rising capabilities and uncertain intentions, particularly those engendered by China’s military expenditure<a class="wiki_link" href="/Full%20Text%20Highlighted%201AC%20-%20GDS#_edn9">[ix</a>], is already evident in the general credibility given to the idea of a ‘China Threat’ in US policy and academic circles (Bernstein &amp; Munro 1997).<a class="wiki_link" href="/Full%20Text%20Highlighted%201AC%20-%20GDS#_edn10">[x</a>] US policy: misapplication of realism </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Defensive</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> realist </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">policies</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> are based upon interactions between status quo security seekers. Generally, therefore, they </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">agree that a tough stance may provoke the non-aggressive adversary, increase tension, and induce an insecurity spiral, while a conciliatory policy may have the desirable effect of resolving conflict and reducing tension with an essentially nonaggressive adversary. In contrast, when dealing with an expansionist opponent, a policy of firmness promises the desirable effects of deterring him and enhancing one’s own reputation for resolve, while a policy of conciliation may encourage him to make further demands in the belief that one lacks resolve</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Snyder 1984:470). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Given that the explanatory power of the security dilemma decreases when adversaries are greedier, the continued application of</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> defensive realism’s cautionary </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">policies of reassurance, designed to avoid intensifying spirals of conflict, become at best less helpful, and at worst potentially disastrous if they encourage aggressive states to exploit military advantages. The inapplicability of defensive</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> realist </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">prescriptions in this situation also reduces states’ potential to control crisis situations. This means the probability of war in Asia could be far greater than offence-defence theorists suggest</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. For example, Robert Ross’ (1999) optimistic assessment of the future of Asia relies on the judgement that the offence- defence balance, heavily influenced by the geography of the region to favour the defence, is relevant even </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">when dealing with an aggressive power such as China</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. In the East Asian region, China could view US policies designed to signal benign security motives, such as a conscious decision not to deploy permanent theatre missile defences in Asia, as indicative of China’s strength, and US lack of resolve in the face of that influence. Any such policy would be dangerous, inviting a non-status quo China to exploit the military advantages of such a policy, and encouraging Beijing to make further demands. For example, China could increase its ballistic missile capability for striking at the US homeland, and demand that the US remove all forward deployed troops. After concluding that China is a rising or non-status quo power, it follows that prescriptions for ameliorating security dilemmas in which it plays a role, such as adopting defensive force postures and clearly differentiating between offensive and defensive force acquisitions, will be ineffective since states will not dare to adopt such postures for fear of exploitation. Consequently, it is argued that the status quo bias of security dilemma theory makes it an inadequate explanatory framework for the region and the US-China relationship. To the extent that security dilemma is used by policy elites to understand and analysis the US-China relationship, then US foreign policy has been distorted by the misapplication of realism. Conclusions: alternate policy formulations Many policy options to deal with China have been proposed, however, most fall into either the category of containment or engagement (Shambaugh Segal ). I argue that in order to remedy this misapplication, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">a policy of firmness towards dissatisfied powers such as China promises the desirable effects of <strong>deterring it</strong> and enhancing one’s own reputation for resolve. Firmness does not, however, necessarily equate with a policy of containment</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.<a class="wiki_link" href="/Full%20Text%20Highlighted%201AC%20-%20GDS#_edn11">[xi</a>] </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Instead, it is suggested that some combination of engagement and containment might be possible to preserve some of the hope of the engagement policy, while hedging against its possible inability to discourage China from challenging US interests and objectives</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Such a ‘third way’ has been proposed by a recent RAND report entitled The United States and a Rising China: Strategic and Military Implications (Khalilzad et al 1999). </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">This policy option, coined ‘congagement’, would continue to try to bring China into the current international system, while both preparing for a Chinese challenge to it, and seeking to convince the Chinese leadership that a challenge would be difficult to prepare and extremely risky to pursue</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Similar strategies, alternatively labeled ‘conditioning’ (Byman et al 1999) and ‘constrainment’ (Segal 1996) have also emerged. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Such hedging policies all have one thing in common: their ultimate goal is to change China’s behaviour, but their approach is more direct engagement. While there is a place for continued, but modified engagement and the strengthening of ties with regional countries, the underlying assumption is a more important one: there is a need to sharpen the fundamental choice the Chinese leadership faces – cooperation with the current international system, as opposed to challenging the US world role and pursuing regional hegemony. <strong>Rather than hoping for a transformation of China’s attitudes</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, conditioning or </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">‘congagement’ <strong>seeks a China whose behaviour does not violate US interests</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;"> (Byman et al 1999: 428). Under such a hedging policy, the US would use diplomacy, economic measures and, if necessary, force in order to ensure that its regional interests are protected. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">To some extent, <strong>this policy is already implemented by US</strong> foreign <strong>policy-makers</strong>. The US security presence in East Asia</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, made more durable by the US’ revitalisation of its alliance with Japan in 1996 and 1997, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">is fundamental in convincing China that using force would be counterproductive, and hedging against the possibility that a rising China will become bellicose. If China engaged in threatening actions, the US would respond by increasing its military presence, further strengthening its regional security relationships, or taking other actions to counter Chinese moves</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. It has been suggested by Byman et al that the key to any hedging strategy would be to prioritise US goals, and communicate this to China, and setting up a rewards and punishment system accordingly (1999:429). I have clearly based my analysis on assumptions that </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">China’s</span></u></strong> <u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">longterm <strong>ambitions are expansionary in nature</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. While I believe that </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the weight of evidence suggests this to be the case</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, I do recognise that should China turn out to be a status quo power, then a more assertive and less ambiguous policy than the US is now pursuing may create antagonism where none would have existed. Nevertheless, I would also argue that ‘conditioning’ or </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">‘congagement’ allows the U</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">to respond to aggressive moves by China without precluding cooperation in the meantime</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Such a policy is particularly important and opportune at this moment, considering the worsening relationship between Washington and Beijing at the beginning of the twenty-first century.<a class="wiki_link" href="/Full%20Text%20Highlighted%201AC%20-%20GDS#_edn12">[xii</a>] </span></span><br />

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">Epistemic communities are less a &quot;new&quot; international actor or unit of analysis than they are a vehicle for the development of insightful theoretical premises about the creation of collective interpretation and choice. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">The epistemic communities approach is in fact &quot;methodologically pluralistic</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.&quot;2 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">In pursuing this approach, we seek to bridge the gap between positivist-empirical and relativist-interpretive phenomenological approaches, such as neorealism, liberal institutionalism, neofunctionalism, and cognitive analysis, and to integrate some of their most important insights</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. At the same time, we strongly emphasize that we do not seek a general theory of international politics. Rather, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">our goal is to specify a set of constrained conditions under which order is possible, based on the creation of collective meaning</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, and to make clear our methodology and substantive propositions about a reflective research program. Methodological pluralism and theoretical synthesis, which we take to be our strength, may nevertheless prevent us from achieving the level of parsimony often desired by international relations theorists.3 But what we may lose in parsimony, we may gain in depth and understanding. We hope to persuade our readers that epistemic communities amount to a theoretical focal point which renders our integrative enterprise more intelligible and, indeed, parsimonious. Furthermore, our heuristic contributions to this volume show that a reflective research program based on the concept of epistemic communities is progressive—that is, it generates new findings about familiar cases drawn from such diverse areas as security, international political economy, and the environment.4 As many of the articles in this volume make clear, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">no single theoretical approach—and certainly none of the approaches mentioned above—taken alone offers an adequate explanation of international coordination. Neorealist approaches are notorious for their inability to deduce state interests from international structures without resorting to auxiliary assumptions about domestic politics, communication and socialization, and domestic economic and technological changes</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.5 Furthermore, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">they assume that international actors or units lack even a minimal capacity for deducing different expectations from the same structural change or for reflecting on alternative modes of behavior</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. While such an elegantly parsimonious approach may have been adequate for simpler times, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">the complex nature of current international relations has made such an approach obsolete by seriously questioning the assumption that the system is transparent enough that actors can clearly identify their own interests and accurately interpret the signals and behavior of others. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The approach we propose does not fail to take into account the causal importance of structure. But</span></strong>, at the same time, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it does not make the</span> neorealist <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">mistakes of deducing expectations only from</span></strong> structures and of defining structure in reference only to <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">material distributions of power</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Many scholars have supplemented neorealist approaches with rational choice assumptions</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">, usually making for good formal and heuristic theorizing.6 By incorporating exogenously determined preference orderings into their analyses, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">they have disregarded some of the most important sources of expectations lying at the individual (subjective) and institutional (intersubjective) levels</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.7 The approach has been problematic at best, since preferences and payoffs are seldom obvious, the nature of the game is often obscure, and institutions are not fully responsive to new problems.8 The theory-building process we are involved in can nevertheless be extremely useful for rational choice analysis because, </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">ultimately, we provide the necessary prerequisites for rational choice, explaining where alternatives and payoffs come from</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Neoliberal institutional approaches, according to Joseph Grieco, &quot;basically argue that even if the realists are correct in believing that anarchy constrains the willingness to cooperate, states nevertheless can work together and can do so especially with the assistance of international institutions.&quot;9 We have no quarrel with this argument. But we begin where neoliberal institutional approaches leave off; namely, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">we relate institutions to the dynamic interaction between domestic and international political games</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">, and we describe these games <strong>not only in terms of material interests but also as part of the bargaining and negotiation that take place among different epistemic understandings and</strong> practices &quot;carried&quot; by epistemic communities and later by <strong>policymakers</strong> as well</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. This approach allows us to bridge rational choice and reflective institu- tional approaches and to explain the source not only of interests but also of institutions. Moreover, we aspire to explain the substance of such institutions in terms of the collective understanding of the participating parties as well as their interests. We are indebted to the neofunctionalist and cognitive approaches, and in studying epistemic communities we follow the trail pioneered by Ernst B. Haas and John Gerard Ruggie.10 In contrast to neofunctionalism, however, we do not seek to explain the processes by which authority is transferred from the nation-state to international institutions as problems become more technical and amenable to the creation of scientifically based common meanings. And </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">we are not merely interested in analyzing scientific and political styles of thought as they combine to create various types of world order.&quot; Instead, we regard learning as a process that has to do more with politics than with science, turning the study of political process into a question about who learns what, when, to whose benefit, and why. Our concern is with reasoning, but not with the purely rational forms of reasoning that are assumed by much of the rational choice and neorealist traditions or with the forms that are taken as a teleological taproot for much of the neofunctionalist work. While we focus on rationality, we are agnostic about the form that such rationality will take. By rationality we mean an internally consistent pattern of reasoning. It need not be logico- deductive</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.12 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Our critique of the approaches mentioned above should not be interpreted as reflecting a preference for poststructuralist, postpositivist, and radical interpretive analyses, although we do hope to build a bridge between structural and interpretive approaches. Rejecting the view of international relations as the mere reflections of discourses and habits—wherein the word is power and the only power is the word—we nevertheless have incorporated into our reflective approach the notion that the manner in which people and institutions interpret and represent phenomena and structures makes a difference for the outcomes we can expect in international relations</span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">.13 </span><u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 12pt;">Thus, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we adopt an ontology that embraces</span></strong> historical, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">interpretive factors, as well as structural forces</span></strong>, explaining change in a dynamic way. This ontology reflects <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">an epistemology</span></strong> that is <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">based on a strong element of intersubjectivity</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. <strong>So long as even a tenuous link is maintained between objects and their representation, we can reject an exclusive focus on</strong></span> <strong>words and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">discourse</span></strong>. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">By defending a</span></strong>n epistemological and ontological <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">link between words and the objects with which they are commonly associated</span></strong>, we believe that <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">learning may occur through reflection on empirical events rather than through their representation</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-family: "Verdana","sans-serif"; font-size: 7pt;">. Finally, epistemic communities should not be mistaken for a new hegemonic actor that is the source of political and moral direction in society.14 Epistemic communities are not in the business of controlling societies; what they control is international problems. Their approach is instrumental, and their life is limited to the time and space defined by the problem and its solutions. Epistemic communities are neither philosophers, nor kings, nor philosopher- kings.</span></span><br />
