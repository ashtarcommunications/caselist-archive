===Advantage 1 : Econ=== 

**Best studies prove economic collapse results in conflict**
**ROYAL 10** Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense
[Jedediah Royal, 2010, Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises, in Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215]

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.</span>

**<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Hegemonic decline makes every impact inevitable</span>**
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">**Lieberthal and O’Hanlon** 12 — Kenneth G. Lieberthal, Director of the John L. Thornton China Center and Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy and Global Economy and Development at the Brookings Institution, former Professor at the University of Michigan, served as special assistant to the president for national security affairs and senior director for Asia on the National Security Council, holds a Ph.D. from Columbia University, and Michael E. O'Hanlon, Director of Research and Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institution, Visiting Lecturer at Princeton University, Adjunct Professor at Johns Hopkins University, holds a Ph.D. from Princeton University, 2012 (“The Real National Security Threat: America's Debt,” Los Angeles Times, July 10th, Available Online at http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/07/10-economy-foreign-policy-lieberthal-ohanlon, Accessed 07-12-2012)</span>

Lastly, American economic weakness undercuts U.S. leadership abroad. Other <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND really possible if that fundamental prerequisite to effective foreign policy is not reestablished.</span>

**Hegemony creates structural disincentives for war—theoretical and empirical evidence**
**Wohlforth 9** (William C. Wohlforth, Daniel Webster Professor of Government at Dartmouth College, holds an M.Phil. and Ph.D. in Political Science from Yale University, 2009, “Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War,” World Politics, Volume 61, Number 1, January, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project MUSE, p. 29-31)

The upshot is a near scholarly consensus that unpolarity’s consequences for great power conflict are <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND identity politics and grand strategies under unipolarity are consistent with the theory’s expectations.</span>


**And, alternatives to growth kill hundreds of millions and cause global conflict—we can’t “turn off” the economy.**
**Barnhizer 6** — David R. Barnhizer, Emeritus Professor at Cleveland State University’s Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, 2006 (“Waking from Sustainability's "Impossible Dream": The Decisionmaking Realities of Business and Government,” Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (18 Geo. Int'l Envtl. L. Rev. 595), Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)

The scale of social needs, including the need for expanded productive activity, has <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND social justice while avoiding and mitigating the most destructive consequences of our behavior.</span>

**Growth eliminates the only rational incentives for war**
**Gartzke 11** – associate Professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego PhD from Iowa and B.A. from UCSF Erik, "SECURITY IN AN INSECURE WORLD" [[@http://www.cato-unbound.org/2011/02/09/erik-gartzke/security-in-an-insecure-world/|www.cato-unbound.org/2011/02/09/erik-gartzke/security-in-an-insecure-world/]]

Almost as informative as the decline in warfare has been where this decline is occurring <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND the consolidating forces of prosperity prevail, that war becomes a durable anachronism.</span>

**Infrastructure is crumbling now – that will decimate the economy – only fixing it solves and boosts manufacturing**
**EDR Group 11** (Economic Development Research Group, Inc.—a consulting firm focusing specifically on applying state-of-the-art tools and techniques for evaluating economic development performance, impacts, and opportunities, comprised of economists and planners who are specialists in evaluating the impacts of transportation infrastructure, services, and technology on economic development opportunities, 2011 “Executive Summary,” Failure to Act: The Economic Impact of Current Investment Trends in Surface Transportation Infrastructure, Report Prepared for the American Society of Civil Engineers by the Economic Development Research Group, Inc., http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Infrastructure/Report_Card/ASCE-FailureToActFinal.pdf, p. 3-6)

The nation’s surface transportation infrastructure includes the critical highways, bridges, railroads, and <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND goods and services, relative to competing product prices from around the globe.</span>

**The plan solves—a substantial investment in infrastructure would create jobs and boost aggregate demand**
**Blodget 12** (Henry Blodget, co-founder, CEO, and Editor-In Chief of Business Insider, former top-ranked Wall Street analyst, frequent contributor to the magazines Slate, Newsweek, and New York, 2012 “Yes, It's Time For A Massive Infrastructure Spending Program,” Business Insider, June 19th, Available Online at http://www.businessinsider.com/infrastructure-spending-program-2012-6?op=1, Accessed 09-03-2012)

I recently laid out the fundamental problem with the US economy: Massive consumer debts <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND lousy shape and so many US workers idled by the construction industry slowdown.</span>

**The Fed just implemented a new round of Quantitative Easing—this non-uniques their “stimulus bad,” “inflation,” and “downgrade” arguments.**
**Demint 9/20** (Jim Demint, United States Senator (R-SC), 2012, “Fed Stimulus Goes From 'Shot In The Arm' To 'QE4-Ever',” Investor’s Business Daily, September 20th,http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-viewpoint/092012-626455-fed-stimulus-program-shows-no-end.htm)

We really ought to quit calling the Federal Reserve's latest round of quantitative easing <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND further reduces the value of the dollar and raises the price of commodities.</span>

**The way infrastructure is built needs to be changed– materials we have now will inevitably break down, only a transition to nanotech can be sustainable**
**Steyn 08** (Prof Wynand Steyn is a professional pavement engineer with an interest in pavement engineering, vehicle-pavement interaction, accelerated pavement testing and pavement materials and instrumentation. He has spent 19 years with CSIR in various technical and managerial positions and is currently associate professor of civil engineering (focusing on road pavement related subjects) at the University of Pretoria (UP).

The client for most transportation engineering facilities is the general public, and therefore most <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND process with elements in concrete to lower NOx pollution (Cassar, 2005).</span>

**ONLY that creates the best surface transportation fixes that reduce the impacts of climate and attacks on infrastructure**
**Khan 11** (Mohammud, The author is Senior Vice President, Professional Service Industries, Inc., Herndon, Virginia., “Nanotechnology in Transportation: Evolution of a Revolutionary Technology”, http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/trnews/trnews277.pdf)

Nanomodification of concrete is analogous to modifying and controlling the genes and DNA in the <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or terrorist attacks (photo, below).</span>

**maintaining a large power differential is key—innovation is the lynchpin of hegemony.**
**Tellis 9** — Ashley J. Tellis, Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace specializing in international security, defense and Asian strategic issues, Research Director of the Strategic Asia program at NBR—the National Bureau of Asian Research, holds a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, 2009 (“Preserving Hegemony: The Strategic Tasks Facing the United States,” Global Asia, Volume 4, Number 1, Available Online at http://globalasia.org/pdf/issue9/Ashley_J._Tellis.pdf, Accessed 09-13-2011, p. 55-56)

Second, and equally importantly, who wins in the ensuing struggle — whether that <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND larger encompassing goals.</span>

**Transpo key- advanced R&D spills over to effective manufacturing**
**Lind 12** (Policy director of New America’s Economic Growth Program and a co-founder of the New America Foundation (Michael, “Value Added: America’s Manufacturing Future,” http://growth.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Lind,%20Michael%20and%20Freedman,%20Joshua%20-%20NAF%20-%20Value%20Added%20America%27s%20Manufacturing%20Future.pdf )

Manufacturing, R&D and the U.S. Innovation Ecosystem Perhaps the <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND from 20-30 percent in 2007 to 50 percent by 2020.33</span>

**The manufacturing sector is growing but it’s a question of sustainability**
**Curtin 10/17** (Staff Writer for CNBC News and the Daily Ticker, Stacy, 10/17/12, “Manufacturing 'Recovery' Not All It's Cracked Up to Be?,” [[http://www.cnbc.com/id/49448048]])

While proposals by both candidates aim to build a more robust manufacturing sector, those <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND needs to be involved inmore sophisticated manufacturingthat other countries cannot do.</span>

**Advanced manufacturing technology makes war obsolete – it’s the ultimate deterrent**
**Paone 09** (66th Air Base Wing Public Affairs for the US Air Force, Chuck, 8-10-09, “Technology convergence could prevent war, futurist says,” http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123162500)

The convergence of "exponentially advancing technologies" will form a "super-intelligence <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AND systems or products, he says, even if people don't know it.</span>

**Nanotech in infrastructure is low- cost prohibition, bad understanding of technology- the plans investment solves**
**Steyn 08** (Prof Wynand Steyn is a professional pavement engineer with an interest in pavement engineering, vehicle-pavement interaction, accelerated pavement testing and pavement materials and instrumentation. He has spent 19 years with CSIR in various technical and managerial positions and is currently associate professor of civil engineering (focusing on road pavement related subjects) at the University of Pretoria (UP).
