Wetlands - including rivers, lakes, marshes, estuaries, lagoons, mangroves, seagrass beds, and peatlands - are among the most precious natural resources on Earth. These highly varied ecosystems are natural areas where water accumulates for at least part of the year. Driven by the hydrological cycle, water is continuously being recycled through the land, sea and atmosphere in a process which ensures the maintenance of ecological functions. Wetlands support high levels of biological diversity: they are, after tropical rainforests, amongst the richest ecosystems on this planet, providing essential life support for much of humanity, as well as for other species. Coastal wetlands, which may include estuaries, seagrass beds and mangroves, are among the most productive, while coral reefs contain some of the highest known levels of biodiversity (nearly one-third of all known fish species live on coral reefs). Other wetlands also offer sanctuary to a wide variety of plants, invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, reptiles and mammals, as well as to millions of both migratory and sedentary waterbirds. Wetlands are not only sites of exceptional biodiversity, they are also of enormous social and economic value, in both traditional and contemporary societies. Since ancient times, people have lived along water courses, benefiting from the wide range of goods and services available from wetlands. The development of many of the great civilisations was largely based on their access to, and management of, wetland resources. Wetlands are an integral part of the hydrological cycle, playing a key role in the provision and maintenance of water quality and quantity as the basis of all life on earth. They are often interconnected with other wetlands, and they frequently constitute rich and diverse transition zones between aquatic ecosystems and terrestrial ecosystems such as forests and grasslands. Despite their importance, wetlands are among the most impacted and degraded of all ecological systems. In the past few centuries, they have been commonly regarded as unproductive, unhealthy lands. Many countries, often with government support and backing, have made considerable efforts to convert them from a "worthless" existence to economically viable systems for agriculture or fisheries production. Many have been filled with domestic and industrial wastes (some of which have been of a toxic nature), while others have been drained to create additional land for development. There are few remaining wetlands on Skopelos, but those which still exist are lushly greened. They comprise small wetland areas with various bird sanctuaries, which, despite their proximity to the beaches, are out of sight of swimmers. We are committed to conserving the remaining sites on our island. The local flora consists of rush and glassworts, plants that create an ideal habitat for migratory birds or permanent animal residents. Visitors can see herons – white or not – pelicans, cormorants, herring gulls and many duck species. The wetlands are valuable not only because they serve as staging areas for migratory birds in spring and in autumn but also because they contribute to the conservation of local biodiversity.

So, I'm watching the historic and heartening Anti-war protests on C-Span. By all rights I should probably be there, but the economic circumstances of my present life just really don't allow for it. Still, watching this, I'm a bit disconcerted. I'm hearing lots of things being chanted that I couldn't in good conscience join in on. I can't chant in favor of what the Palestinians have been doing, any more than I can in favor of the Israeli government's response. Both are inhumane and insupportable. I can't chant "Down with America." I don't hate America, I just hate our current(and some of our ongoing) policies. I know all-too-well that nothing is as simple as the chants make it seem. And so on, and so forth. It's probably just a symptom of my Libertarian side, that I'm disconcerted by any sort of a mob mentality, whether directed positively or negatively. The very act of chanting in unison makes me feel like an automaton assuming pre-determined(and over simplified) views. However, I'm learning that individual sanctity must sometimes be sacrificed to solidarity and mass action in order to change things for the better. If that means dealing with true-believer types and over-simplification of the issues, I need to learn to grin and bear it sometimes. It's something I'll probably always be conflicted about, as my abstract, intellectual tendencies just aren't very compatible with the messy realities of mass politics, but I can't let that keep me from participating when the stakes are this high But t<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">his protest movement does need some work. Why do all of these tangential causeheads feel the need to latch on? Why can't we focus solely on the great threats before us? Why does Mumia Abu-Jamal have to be dragged out, again and again, no matter what's being protested? Is there some sort of unwritten law of modern protest, in which we are not allowed to march without his (justly or not)discrediting specter</span>? Why are abortion rights and race being talked about so much? Those are entirely different, though of course very important, protests. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Why can't all of these individual smaller movements that have come together against the war drop their own agendas</span> for one day <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and concentrate on what the protest is supposed to actually be about,</span> or at very least, stick to the parts of their own agenda that are relevant to the war? <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If you want to get credibility with the mass of people, you need to narrow your focus, and stay on message. The temptation to use such a large stage to advance your own cause is no doubt great, but it must be resisted, or the message being sent will always end up fragmented and conflicting</span> like what I heard in today's protests. And where are the really credible voices on the Left in this thing? Are Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson the best they can do for speakers? These people are jokes for most of this country(including most thinking people on the Left), and much of their reputation as such is deserved(and many of the other speakers were even worse). They've long ago exhausted their credibility on media stunts and other political opportunism. When Jessica Lange gives the best speech at a mass event of this scale, you've got problems. Where are people like Ralph Nader, Naomi Klein, Howard Zinn, Coretta Scott King, Jimmy Carter... people with real moral and intellectual credibility? At very least, if you're going to have idealogues, get informed and entertaining ones like Cornel West or Michael Moore to speak.

===NSS CP=== 
Text: The President of the United States should release a National Security Strategy including a statement indicating that increasing investment for a joint seabasing strategy is vital to the security of the United States.

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">It competes – the NSS is a recommendation – not legally binding – Caudle ‘09</span>**

Third, it is unclear who is to ensure that implementation occurs and there is
AND
clearly means cross-governmental action that could run counter to departmental independence.

===Enmity=== 
Violence is inevitable--the 1ACs movement of peace destroys the political by erasing the borders that sustain the friend-enemy distinction
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rasch 5</span> Professor and Chair of Germanic Studies, Indian University Bloomington, Ph.D. U of Washington/ [William, “Lines in the Sand: Enmity as a Structuring Principle”, The South Atlantic Quarterly, 104:2, Spring]
In The Concept of the Political, Schmitt concludes that ‘‘all genuine political theories
AND
that this imperfection manifests itself as violence and the guilt associated with it.
Dissolving stable friend enemy binaries causes global genocidal war and lashout
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Reinhard 4</span> Kenneth Reinhard, Professor of Jewish Studies, UCLA, 2004, UCLA Center for Jewish Studies, “Towards a Political Theology of the Neighbor,” http://www.cjs.ucla.edu/Mellon/Towards_Political_Theology.pdf
If the concept of the political is defined, as Carl Schmitt does, in
AND
appeasing contours, because they would be identifiable” (PF 83).

<span class="Author">The alternative is to reject the affirmative to spatially exclude us from them in a way that recognizes the other’s legitimacy - limits conflict and prevents total war </span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rasch 5</span> Professor and Chair of Germanic Studies, Indian University Bloomington, Ph.D. U of Washington [William, “Lines in the Sand: Enmity as a Structuring Principle”, The South Atlantic Quarterly, 104:2, Spring]
Schmitt, then, starts from the premise of imperfection and acknowledges an ontological priority
AND
it may also always produce recurring, asphyxiating political nightmares of absolute exclusion.

===Management=== 
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">The aff is grounded in a managerial ontology of the environment </span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">McWhorter ‘92</span>
Prof of Philosophy and Women, Gender & Sexuality studies @ Univ. of Richmond
(Ladelle, “Guilt as Management Technology: A Call to Heideggerian Reflection” Heidegger and the Earth, pg. 5-7)
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The noted physicist Stephen Hawking, in his popular book A Brief History of Time, writes... directions of which we have not yet dreamed, directions of which we may never dream. </span>

Management increases complexity and results in extinction
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lander 2</span>,
(Edgardo, Prof. of Sociology and Latin American studies at the Venezuelan Central University in Caracas, Eurocentrism, Modern Knowledges, and the “Natural” Order of Global Capital, Nepantla: Views from South 3.2, muse)
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The “freedom of commerce” that the interests of these transnational... totalitarian monoculture of Eurocentric knowledge only lead to destruction and death.</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The alternative is do nothing to reject management and engage in an understanding of the environment</span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">McWhorter 92</span>
Prof of Philosophy and Women, Gender & Sexuality studies @ Univ. of Richmond
(Ladelle, “Guilt as Management Technology: A Call to Heideggerian Reflection” Heidegger and the Earth, pg. 1-4)
Heidegger calls<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> us to give thought to</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> — or give ourselves over to thought of ...</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">assumptions that also ground the most basic patterns of our current ways of being human.</span>
===Cap=== 
Infrastructure investment is capitalist - people, values and goods become commodities to be transported
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Giddens and Held 82</span> (Anthony and David; M.A. and Ph.D. in economics, Prof. at Cambridge, Director of the London School of Economics, he has 15 honorary degrees; Master of University College, Durham, professor of politics and international relations at Durham University; “Classes, Power and Conflict: Classical and Contemporary Debates”; Pg. 253)//RSW
7. Policies which pursue the goal of reorganizing, maintaining and generalizing exchange relationships
AND
of the capitalist state against the obstructive resistance of the capitalist class itself.
Resisting capitalism’s reliance on economic evaluation is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees exclusion - role of the ballot is ethics
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zizek and Daly 4</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 14-16)</span>
For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of postmodern protocol
AND
abject Other to that of a ‘glitch’ in an otherwise sound matrix.
The alternative is to do nothing – creates radical negativity that creates authentic alternatives
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Johnston 4</span> interdisciplinary research fellow in psychoanalysis at Emory University, 2004
Adrian, Psychoanalysis, Culture & Society, December v9 i3 p259 page infotrac
Perhaps the absence of a detailed political roadmap in Zizek's recent writings isn't a major
AND
comforting fiction ("Capitalist commodity fetishism or the truth? I choose fetishism").

===Badiou=== 
**The affirmative claim to save a particular identity group is what Badiou calls a simulacrum of the truth. Simulacrums are dangerous because they create an “us” of ethical insiders vs a “them” of outsiders. This is the root of war, racism, and genocide. Only a search for universals that we refuse to impose on others can be emancipatory.**
**Badiou, 98** (Alain, Professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, //Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil,// 73-77)
What allows a genuine event to be at the origin of a truth -which
AND
form of death which is slavery in the service of the German substance.

**Ethical principles remove us from the urgency of particular needs. We focus on identifying situations that match the rules, rather than imagining a positive vision of the future. This reduces us all to a subhuman mass.**
**The alternative is to break with such rules and give ourselves over to the particular event—what Badiou calls fidelity to the event.**
**Badiou, 98** (Alain, Professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, //Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil,// 14-16)
Every collective will to the Good creates Evi1. This is sophistry at its most
AND
it -it must send away to die in the shantytowns of Kinshasa.

===Welsh=== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">There exists an intrinsic antagonism in debate </span>–On one side, debate is always shaped by strategy, winning, debate theory. The other side is the desire to influence a larger public. What the Aff fails to recognize is that their desire to change the debate community is always shaped by the norms of debate. Your aff will never be receptive TO the larger public. Let us view the outside of the academy as more important than our debate spaces.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Welsh 12 </span>Scott Department of Communication Appalachian State University (“Coming to Terms with the Antagonism between Rhetorical Reflection and Political Agency”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2012, Jstor)
Giroux’s concluding words, in which scholars reclaim the promises of a truly global democratic
AND
outside the academy that there can be immediate, material, political consequences.
Our argument is particularly true to the 1AC - using debate for political purposes tradeoffs with producing tools useful for the public.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Welsh 12 </span>Scott Department of Communication Appalachian State University (“Coming to Terms with the Antagonism between Rhetorical Reflection and Political Agency”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2012, Jstor)
What does it mean to say rhetoric scholarship should be relevant to democratic practice?
AND
no less of an impediment to the production of democratically consequential rhetoric scholarship.
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Alternative – Reject the affirmative because of their use of debate as a mode/conception of political agency. </span>Our alternative is to come to terms with antagonism by keeping competing elements of the antagonism in view and understanding the limits of debate as political agency in itself.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Welsh 12</span>
Scott Department of Communication Appalachian State University (“Coming to Terms with the Antagonism between Rhetorical Reflection and Political Agency”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2012, Jstor)
In light of Žižek’s account of antagonism, one should not be surprised, however
AND
of what Žižek calls supplemental ideological fantasies or ready explanations for the gap.
