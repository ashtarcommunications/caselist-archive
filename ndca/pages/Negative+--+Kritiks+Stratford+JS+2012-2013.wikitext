**<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Debate serves the social function as a performative machine erecting lived Worlds upon a Time-Image. Whereas the 1AC reads Apocalypse through a Time-Image of mainstream newspaper and academic hermeneutics to suggest a world emptied of humanity, our argument is that such a notion is the creation of a historically Eurocentric Time-Image which views extinction as the only alternative to Western domination. Our role of the ballot is to unpack the social history of the 1AC thereby reading __affirmative possibility__ into apocalyptic events. This social engagement is a prerequiste for understanding present events</span>**
