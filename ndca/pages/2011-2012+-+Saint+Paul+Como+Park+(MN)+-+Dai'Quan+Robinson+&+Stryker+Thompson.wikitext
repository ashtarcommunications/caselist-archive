**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">The United States Air force should increase its Space Situational Awareness capabilities by pursuing a defensive space strategy that emphasizes replacement, stealthing, and an evolutionary space acquisition for SBSS and Spy satellites beyond the Earth’s mesosphere.</span>**

===Deterrence Advantage=== 

Current threats in the Squo fail- It’s too damn hard to believe that Washington would reverse its course- three reasons why
