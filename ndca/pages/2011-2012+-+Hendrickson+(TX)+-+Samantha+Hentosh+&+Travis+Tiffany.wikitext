Contention 1 is Inherency:
First, space based solar power is the next big frontier and can be deployed in the next year
Rebecca <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Costa</span>, a sociobiologist, author of The Watchman’s Rattle: Thinking Our Way Out of Extinction, former CEO of Silicon Valley start-up Dazai Advertising, Inc graduated from the University of California with a BA in Social Sciences, 11/1/<span style="font-size: 12pt;">10</span>, “Can NASA Save a Struggling America”, http://cleantechnica.com/2010/11/01/can-nasa-save-struggling-america/

And, SPS solves within 10 years – U.S. funding is the only hurdle and spurs investment
The <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sunday Times</span>, 8-28-<span style="font-size: 12pt;">11</span> (2021: a space power odyssey; Solar energy plants in orbit could be supplying homes within 10 years, scientists claim. Ben Marlow reports on two pioneers” lexis)

Plan: The United States federal government should develop and deploy space based solar power.

Contention 2 is Deterrence
First, decline of US power projection emboldens challengers and results in great power wars
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zhang and Shi</span>**, 1/22/**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">11</span>** – Yuhan Zhang is a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, D.C.; Lin Shi is from Columbia University.

(America’s decline: A harbinger of conflict and rivalry, http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/01/22/americas-decline-a-harbinger-of-conflict-and-rivalry/)

We solve – two internal links
Scenario 1 is Aerospace
First, current lack of US space policy prevents success in the aerospace industry – government action is key
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Maser 11</span>[Jim, Chair of the Corporate Membership Committee – American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and President – Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, “A Review of NASA’s Exploration Program in Transition: Issues for Congress and Industry”, U.S. House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Hearing, 3-30, <span style="text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.prattwhitney.com/media_center/executive_speeches/jim_maser_03-30-2011.asp]]</span>]

And, SPS and its spillover technology is the critical component to ensure that the US remains the aerospace leader.

Scenario 2 is Mobility

First, current military supply lines are inefficient, SPS is key to elimination and forward deployment

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Energy security and national security ...</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 6pt;">well positioned to accelerate the development and deployment of such technologies"</span>


Independently, that’s key to deter conflict and sustain US leadership internationally

Scenario 2 is Peak Oil

Peak oil inevitable and coming soon- alternatives fail
