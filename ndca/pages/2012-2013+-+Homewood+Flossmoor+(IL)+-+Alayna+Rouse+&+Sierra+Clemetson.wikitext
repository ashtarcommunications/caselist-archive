<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Over the last year, as the U.S. economy has slipped toward (and likely into) recession, there has been much talk of decoupling. According to this idea the global economy has decoupled from the U.S. economy and can continue growing even if the U.S. goes into recession. That idea is now proving fragile.</span>**__<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"> Instead of decoupling, the global economy is showing signs of a concertina effect</span>__**

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 3pt;">This is a good thing, and it should continue to be a primary goal of American foreign policy to perpetuate this relatively benign international configuration of power. The unipolar order with the United States as the predominant power is unavoidably riddled with flaws and contradictions. It inspires fears and jealousies. The United States is not immune to error, like all other nations, and because of its size and importance in the international system those errors are magnified and take on greater significance than the errors of less powerful nations. Compared to the ideal Kantian international order, in which all the world's powers would be peace-loving equals, conducting themselves wisely, prudently, and in strict obeisance to international law</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">,</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"> __the unipolar system__</span>
