===China FDI CP=== 
====1NC==== 
The People’s Republic of China should give the necessary funds to the United States federal government under the condition that the United States federal government remove the following dams with those funds: Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower Granite.

The counterplan attracts private investors
Budnick 11 (Andew Budnick, et al., the Princeton Task Force on Chinese Investment in the United States, “Economic Patriotism: How to Deal with Chinese Investment,” Woodrow Wilson School of International Affairs, Princeton University, December 2011, http://www.princeton.edu/~smeunier/Princeton_Task_Force_Report_Final_2011)
SelectUSA does not receive funding comparable to equivalent agencies in peer countries. While partially

The counterplan solves 100% of the case – it’s popular in both the U.S. and China

Many Americans might be surprised to hear that this state of affairs leaves China's top

Chinese direct investment uniquely ensures positive and resilient relations, aligns interests and prevents future conflict

Foreign ownership of domestic assets is a deeper form of global economic integration than simply

====2NC Overview==== 
The counterplan solves 100% of the case – U.S. says yes, shields the link to politics, and maintains fiscal discipline and treasuries prices
Yuwei, 2/14/12 – senior staff writer for China Daily, (Zhang, “Chinese funds could help strengthen US infrastructure”, China Daily, February 14, 2012, http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2012-02/14/content_14606475.htm)//JKahn

National Investment Initiative
AND
foreign direct investment by the end of 2013

====A/T Perm Do Both==== 
The permutation links to politics and uniquely triggers the net benefits because of perception that China’s not in control of invested assets
Kotler 12— graduate of the University of Chicago, with an M.A. in Political Science, member of the National Committee on United States-China Relations and the University Club of Washington, D.C., Chairman of Kotler Marketing Group, chairman of the Kotler Group China, a well-respected Chinese business firm involved heavily in international commerce, (Milton, “Marketing Infrastructure Investment”, Milton Kotler’s China Blog, 5/30/12, http://mkotlerchinablog.blogspot.com/2012/05/marketing-infrastructure-investment.html)
Infrastructure investment Marketers are international in a global economy, not nationalistic. They should

The plan’s inclusion trades off with Chinese FDI
Selaya 8 (Pablo Selaya and Eva R. Sunesen, Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen, “Does Foreign Aid Increase Foreign Direct Investment?” Discussion Papers No. 08-04, 2008, [[http://www.econ.ku.dk/english/research/publications/wp/2008/0804.pdf/]])
Due to its potential to transfer knowledge and technology, create jobs, boost overall

====A/T Congress says No==== 

Congress says yes—China investment into US infrastructure has Chinese and American governmental support
WSJ, 6/23/12 – The Wall Street Journal, (“China, U.S. Sign $3.4 Billion in Deals”, June 23, 2012, The Wall Street Journal, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304898704577484301175648684.html)

Biodiversity Loss Causes Ecosystem Collapse and Human Extinction
Major David Diner 1994 JAG Corps, United States Army, Winter 1994, Military Law Review, 143 Mil. L. Rev. 161, p. 170-173

Why Do We Care? -- No species has ever dominated its fellow species as
AND
wings, mankind [humankind] may be edging closer to the abyss.
==Critiques== 
===TAOISM=== 
Death and misfortune are inevitable. Plans to fix the world are rooted in an egotistical desire for management and control that is the root cause of all suffering and violence.
Slabbert ’01 (Jos, Taoist teacher and philosopher “Tao Te Ching: Qualities of Compassion: How to Deal With Suffering,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: initial;">[[http://www.taoism.net/theway/suffer.htm]]</span>)
If you open yourself to loss,
AND
the more we tamper with it, the more damage we will do.

The alternative is to take no action to create desired ends—this is no mere resignation but rather an acceptance of the notion that we are created out of a combination of movements and will be part of a further transformation after our deaths
Kirkland ’96 (Russell, professor of Asian religions and Taoism at the University of Georgia, “The Book of the Way,” Great Literature of the Eastern World, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: initial;">[[http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/pubs/DAODE.pdf]]</span>)
Specifically, the Tao is humble, yielding, and non-assertive. Like
AND
most powerful force in existence, and nothing can thwart its unceasing operation.

===Virilio K=== 
The drive to improve transportation infrastructure is rooted in a worship of speed—time conquers space as we seek endless acceleration which dissolves politics
Virilio, 1997 – Professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School (Paul, Open sky, verso, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: initial;">[[http://www.rhizomes.net/issue8/kuswa.htm|print,]]</span> 81-83) //BZ//
//But let us get back to Europe’s great engineering projects and the political significance of//
//AND//
//to enable messages instantaneously trans-mitted long-distance to be connected.//

//Our worship of acceleration makes a catastrophic Accident inevitable—the politics of speed turn the case and guarantee war and extinction//
//Sykes, 2009 – graduate student at the university of north texas (Jason, “Paul Virilio’s critique of speed, technology, and institutions”, pdf available online)// BZ
In Virlio’s view, the war machine is the demiurge of technological development and an
AND
We must politicize speed. (Virilio, 1983, pg. 35)”

The alternative is to brake—academic discussions must slow down and critically investigate the politics of speed before we come to a decision. Your responsibility as an intellectual is to vote negative to foster democratic engagement and not rush to judgment
Glezos 2009 - Ph.D. in political theory and international relations from Johns Hopkins University, now works in the department of political science at University of Regina (<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: initial;">[[http://www.lib.umich.edu/articles/search?author=Glezos%2C%20Simon|Simon]]</span>, “ The politics of speed: Capitalism, the state and war in an accelerating world” [dissertation] pg. 93-94) //BW
The goal then is thus to politicize the military, to politicize war, to
AND
cycle of reinforcement between speed, war and the (Globalitarian) state.

===Gender K=== 
The affirmative’s logic that connects mobility with freedom is masculine dominated and only seeks to control space
Bauhardt 4 (Christine, Technical University of Berlin Institute of Urban and Regional Planning, Urban Development and Transportation Infrastructures: Insights from the Ruhr Region, http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CFkQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifz.tugraz.at%2FMedia%2FDateien%2FDownloads-IFZ%2FSummer-Academy%2FProceedings-2004%2FUrban-Development-and-Transportation-Infrastructures-Insights-from-the-Ruhr-Region&ei=1bjxT4TdK4is8QS1u4X3DA&usg=AFQjCNETXWV2Zg7c7C1sVijFo3CcG7tCkA JGC )
My first thesis is that the acceleration of these tendencies and their equation with economic
AND
transportation conditions and thereby also guarantee the free movement of all urban inhabitants.

Your methodology causes violence and relies on a flawed exclusionary epistemology—the lens you view the world from ensures error replication, prefer the stance of a critical intellectual
Sjoberg 2k (Laura Sjoberg is a feminist scholar of international relations and international security.

The first principle of the proposed feminist viewpoint concerning international relations is a comprehensive,
