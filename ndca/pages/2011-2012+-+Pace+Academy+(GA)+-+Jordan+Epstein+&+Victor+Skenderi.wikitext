===__Pos Peace__=== 
**The affirmative represents peace as an absence of war, endorsing a worldview that manages outbreaks of violence from flashpoint to flashpoint. But this only creates a negative peace which perpetuates the vicious cycle of violence and militarism that has been endemic to the last century. Positive peace breaks down the deadlock of militarism by creating the possibility of structural change.**
Ha Poong **Kim** **Philosophy Department, Eastern Illinois University, USA Bulletin of Peace Proposals, Vol. 18, No. 1, 19**87
**Peace denotes a nonwarring … is fully capable of<span class="s2">.</span>**

By continuing to think of war as an isolated event, we blind ourselves to the fact that war and militarism are an ongoing process woven into the very fabric of our lives. Organizing ourselves in opposition to the flashpoints of conflict reproduces militarism and perpetuates structural violence.

===__Revolutionary Ethics__=== 
**The Aff poses the question of ethics only insofar as it relates to the domain of politics. Tying ethical reorientation of ourselves with the reorientation of our collective political spheres takes precedent and produces ethics and our relationship with others merely as a BACKGROUND for political transformations. The aff makes the question NOT how we can change ourselves but instead how we can change our institutions to change ourselves. This process produces mediated relationships that make genuine ethical engagement impossible.**
**Zupancic ‘2k**
[Alenka. Institute of Philosophy @ U of Ljubljana. <span class="s1">The Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan</span>, 2000. Pg 10-11//]//
//In other words… the faculty of desire as a priori.//


//**The belief that our activism must respond to the political conditions of our time through the leveraging of particular institutional appeals is precisely what nullifies our ethical potential. No matter the force of its opposition, the connection of transformation with an appeal to our institutions mediates our relationships in such a manner that ethical transformation becomes impossible.**//
//**Hershock ‘99**//
//[Scholar at the East-West Center. “Changing the Way Society Changes” <span class="s1">The Journal of Buddhist Ethics, Vol 6</span>. 1999. MUSE//]
I have argued at some … right' and 'being wronged'.


**The displacement of our ethics onto external political institutions culminates in genocidal violence. Once we accept that our ethics are contingent on the political, all atrocities become possible.**
**Zupancic ‘2k**
[Institute of Philosophy @ Ljubljana. <span class="s1">The Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan</span>, March 2000. Pg 96-97]
“Another problem still remains, …-product' of our actions.

**We advocate the ethical commitment of the 1AC in its immediacy. If mediation of our ethics is the source of our ethical bankruptcy, suspending that mediation constitutes the only genuine ethical act.**
