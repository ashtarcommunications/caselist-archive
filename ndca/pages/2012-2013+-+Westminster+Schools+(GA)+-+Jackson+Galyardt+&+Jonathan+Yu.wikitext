__Contention 1 is Trade__

Exports Could Contribute to … many long-standing difficulties.

5.6 Direct Costs of Not Deepening … should be expanded as a matter of national policy.

**Three impacts—**

**First, economic decline leads to great power wars**

**Royal 10**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Jedediah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, (Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises, Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215)</span>

Less intuitive is how periods …considered ancillary to those views.

**Second, protectionism will cause terrorism and global wars – risks extinction**

Continuing calls for curbs on … societies as the beginnings of a new world war.

Third, **<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Trade stops conflict escalation—individuals won’t risk opportunity costs</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Kleinberg et al 12</span>**
(Kleinberg, Katja B., Robinson, Gregory, French, Stewart L., professors at Binghamton University and Saginaw Valley State University, March 2012, “Trade Concentration and Interstate Conflict”, The Journal of Politics, p. 529-40)FS

In the most commonly … the likelihood of interstate conflict.
<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">
</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">Naval Power</span></span>

**__Contention 2 is Naval Power__**

**Two Internal Links**

**First is the Maritime Industry**
**Lack of port deepening will __break__ the US maritime industry**
**Weakley 08**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Realize America’s Maritime promise, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Fairness Coalition, testimony of James Weakley the president of the Lake Carriers’ Association (James, “Realize America’s Maritime Promise”, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Fairness Coalition, 4/30/08, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.ramphmtf.org/speeches_043008.html]]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">)</span>

Port-related jobs are critical … would quickly lose its efficiencies.

**<span style="color: #222222;">The maritime industry is key to naval primacy—it affects every sector of the navy</span>**

**<span style="color: #222222;"> NLUS 5/7</span>**<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">/2012 (Navy League of the United States, Since 1902, the NLUS has sought to provide a stronger sea voice to Congress and to the American people, “America’s Maritime Industry: the foundation of American seapower.”, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">[[@http://www.navyleague.org/files/americas-maritime-industry.pdf]]</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">) </span>

The American Maritime Industry … incapability, but must maintain that lead. 13

**<span style="color: #222222;">Specifically it’s key to power projection and naval readiness</span>**
**<span style="color: #222222;">AMP, 2012</span>**<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">- American Maritime Partnership, dedicated to educating America on the economic, national security, environmental and safety benefits of the maritime industry, (“U.S. TRANSCOM General Says Domestic Maritime Industry is "Fourth Arm of Defense”, DOA, 5-22,</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">[[@http://www.americanmaritimepartnership.com/news/2012/052212%20NMD.html]]</span><span style="color: #222222; font-size: 8pt;">, 7-13-13)</span>

With the loss of a large number … sufficient to its future. Pity it if it does not.

**Naval dominance is key to prevent the rise of any global challengers and the lynchpin of hegemony**
**Stratfor 2008** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">- the world’s leading private intelligence service. (“U.S.: Naval Dominance and the Importance of Oceans,” http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/u_s_naval_dominance_and_importance_oceans)</span>

Our statement that control of the … enviable geopolitical position.

**Hegemony solves all great power conflict**
**Kagan 12**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">– (Robert Kagan is a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. Adapted from "The World America Made," A version of this article appeared February 11, 2012, on page C1 in some U.S. editions of The WallStreet Journal, with the headline: “Why the World Needs America.” http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203646004577213262856669448.html </span>

History shows that world orders… before the American order came into being.

**Second is Sealift-**
**<span style="color: #222222;">Sealift is key to military readiness and military deployment</span>**

Since the earliest days of …military’s capabilities for war.” 10

As I stated at the beginning …operational and strategic success.

===Plan=== 

**PLAN—**
The United States federal government should substantially increase its investment in port deepening projects in the United States.
<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">
</span>
===Solvency=== 

**__Contention 3: Solvency__**

**Increased investment is key – the federal government’s __uncertain commitment__ prevents new projects.**
**Szakonyi 12** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">— associate editor of the Journal of Commerce (Mark, “The Hill Ramping Up Dredging Efforts”, Journal of Commerce, 5/7, ProQuest)</span>

The push by U.S. ports … meaningful long-term decisions.

**Federal government is key – constitution prevents other actors from acting**
**AAPA 11**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – AAPA represents 160 of the leading seaport authorities in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean and more than 300 sustaining and associate members, firms and individuals with an interest in seaports (American Association of Port Authorities, “The U.S. Government’s Historic Role in Developing and Maintaining Landside and Waterside Connections to Seaports”, March 2011, http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/PDFs/Transportation%20and%20the%20Constitution1.pdf) </span>

Over time these constitutional … be recognized and prioritized.
