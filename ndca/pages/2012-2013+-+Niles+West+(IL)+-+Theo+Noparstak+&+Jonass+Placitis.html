<span class="underline">does it could be prohibitively expensive for the U</span>nited <span class="underline">S</span>tates <span class="underline">to be involved</span>.<br />
Rather than being instruments of regional pacification, today <em>America’s alliances are transmission belts for war</em> that ensure<span class="underline"> that </span>the U.S. would be embroiled in Eurasian wars<span class="underline">. In deciding whether to go war in Eurasia, </span>the U<span class="underline">nited </span>S<span class="underline">tates </span>should not allow its hands to be tied in advance.

<span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">As Mike Shuster said a moment ago, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">the main subject of the summit in South Korea is the problem of</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">potentially</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">insecure nuclear materials around the world</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. For short, loose nukes. In April 2009, President Obama called for a global effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in four years.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Well, on the eve of the Seoul Summit, the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School has released a progress report on that four-year effort. And joining us is one of the authors, Matthew Bunn, a former White House staffer who's now at Harvard and is a specialist on this issue. Welcome to the program once again.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> DR. MATTHEW BUNN: Good to be here.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> SIEGEL: And first, what's encouraging in your progress report is that you actually find there has been some progress. How do you measure that progress?</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> BUNN: Well, it's a hard thing to measure the progress. But we look at those stocks of nuclear material or nuclear weapons that seem to us to pose some of the highest risks. And we say, is something being done to reduce that risk and is it significant? And we find that for most of the highest risk stocks, the answer is yes.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> For example, Ukraine just got rid of all of the weapons-usable nuclear material on its soil. The one area where we said, you know, there is progress on nuclear security but </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">the things that threaten</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">nuclear security are growing even faster, and so the risk is getting worse and not better</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, was Pakistan.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> SIEGEL: That's right. In assessing the three highest-risk nuclear stockpiles, you report significant progress and risks that are either stable or declining in Russia and in research reactors around the world. But </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">when the subject is Pakistan, your report is</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> a lot more </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">disturbing</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> BUNN: Well, Pakistan has a small and well-guarded nuclear stockpile. But </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">that stockpile faces huge threats</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, both </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">from insiders who might help steal nuclear weapons or materials</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, and from outsiders who might attack. There were well-armed, well-trained outsiders who attacked Pakistani military headquarters and a Pakistani military base, in both cases apparently with inside information. And you worry about that kind of attack taking place at a nuclear weapons storage site.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> SIEGEL: Well, your report acknowledges a kind of a paradoxical irony here, which is you talk about that. And the Pakistanis come to regard a U.S. strike to secure their nuclear arsenal as one of their vulnerabilities. And they become even more opaque and less cooperative about their nuclear program.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> BUNN: That's absolutely true. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">The Pakistanis won't let</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, for example, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">U.S. experts go to their nuclear sites</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> because they're afraid if we knew where they were we'd be tempted to seize their nuclear stockpiles. I think </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">Pakistan is an ongoing concern</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> in part </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">because their stockpile is</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> also </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">the fastest-growing in the world</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">.

The Georgian seller offered cesium, a byproduct of nuclear reactors that terrorists can use to arm a dirty bomb with the power to kill. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But one of the</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Turkish </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">men</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, wearing a suit and casually smoking a cigarette, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">made clear he was after</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> something even more dangerous: </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">uranium, the material for a nuclear bomb</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The would-be buyers agreed to take a photo of the four cylinders and see if their boss in Turkey was interested. They did not know police were watching through a hidden camera. As they got up to leave, the police rushed in and arrested the men, according to Georgian officials, who were present. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The encounter</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, which took place in April, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">reflected a fear shared by U.S. and Georgian officials: Despite years of effort and hundreds of millions of dollars spent in the fight against the</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> illicit </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sale of nuclear contraband,<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> the black market remains active</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> in the countries </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">around the former Soviet Union</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The radioactive materials, mostly left over from the Cold War, include nuclear bomb-grade uranium and plutonium, and dirty-bomb isotopes like cesium and iridium.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> The extent of the black market is unknown, but </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a steady stream of attempted sales</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> of radioactive materials</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> in recent years suggests smugglers have</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> sometimes </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">crossed borders undetected</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Since the formation of a special nuclear police unit in 2005 with U.S. help and funding, 15 investigations have been launched in Georgia and dozens of people arrested.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Six</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> of the </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">investigations were disclosed publicly</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> for the first time to The Associated Press by Georgian authorities. Officials with the U.S. government and the International Atomic Energy Agency declined to comment on the individual investigations, but President Barack Obama noted in a speech earlier this year that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">countries like Georgia and Moldova have seized highly enriched uranium from smugglers</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. An IAEA official, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to comment, said the agency is concerned </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">smuggling is still occurring in Georgia</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Four of the</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> previously undisclosed </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">cases</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, and a fifth — an arrest in neighboring Turkey announced by officials there — </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">occurred </span></span><em><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">this year</span></em><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. One from last year involved enough cesium-137 to make a deadly dirty bomb, officials said.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Also, Georgian officials see links between two older cases involving highly enriched uranium, which in sufficient quantity can be used to make a nuclear bomb. The AP's interviews with the two imprisoned smugglers in one case suggested that the porous borders and the poverty of the region contributed to the problem.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The arrests in the casino resort of Batumi stand out for two reasons: </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">They suggest there are real buyers</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> — many of the other investigations involved stings with undercover police acting as buyers. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">And</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> they suggest </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> buyers are interested in material that can be used to make </span></span><em><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a nuclear weapon</span></em><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> &quot;Real buyers are rare in nuclear smuggling cases, and raise real risks,&quot; said nuclear nonproliferation specialist Matthew Bunn, who runs Harvard's Project on Managing the Atom. &quot;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">They suggest someone is actively seeking to buy material</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> for a clandestine bomb.&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> The request for uranium raises a particularly troubling question.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> &quot;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">There's no plausible reason for looking for black-market uranium other than for nuclear weapons</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">— or profit, by selling to people who are looking to make nuclear weapons,&quot; Bunn said.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Georgia</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">'s proximity to the large stockpiles of Cold War-era nuclear material, its position along trade routes to Asia and Europe, the roughly 225 miles (360 kilometers) of unsecured borders of its two breakaway republics, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and the poverty of the region may explain why the nation of 4.5 million </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has become a transit point for nuclear material</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Georgian officials say the radioactive material in the five new cases this year all transited through Abkhazia, which borders on Russia and has Russian troops stationed on its territory.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Abkhazia's foreign ministry said it has no information about the Georgian allegations and would not comment, but in the past it has denied Georgian allegations.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Russia maintains that it has secured its</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> radioactive </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">material</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> — including bomb-grade uranium and plutonium — and that Georgia has exaggerated the risk because of political tension with Moscow. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">But</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> while the vast majority of the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal and radioactive material has been secured, U.S. officials say that some </span><em><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">material in the region remains loose</span></em><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> &quot;Without a doubt, we are aware and have been over the last several years that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">not all nuclear material is accounted for</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">,&quot; says Simon Limage, deputy assistant secretary for non-proliferation programs at the U.S. State Department. &quot;It is true that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a portion that we are concerned about continues to be </span></span><em><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">outside of regulatory control</span></em><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> U.S. efforts to prevent smuggling have prioritized bomb-grade material because of the potential that a nuclear bomb could flatten a U.S. city. But security officials say an attack with a dirty bomb — explosives packed with radioactive material — would be easier for a terrorist to pull off. And terrorist groups, including al-Qaida, have sought the material to do so. A study by the National Defense University found that the economic impact from a dirty bomb attack of a sufficient scale on a city center could exceed that of the September 11, 2011, attacks on New York and Washington. The U.S. government has been assisting about a dozen countries believed to be vulnerable to nuclear smuggling, including Georgia, to set up teams that combine intelligence with police undercover work. Limage says Georgia's team is a model for the other countries the U.S. is supporting.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> On Jan. 6, police arrested a man in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, and seized 36 vials with cesium-135, a radioactive isotope that is hard to use for a weapon. The man said he had obtained the material in Abkhazia. In April, Georgian authorities arrested a group of smugglers from Abkhazia bringing in three glass containers with about 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) of yellowcake uranium, a lightly processed substance that can be enriched into bomb-grade material.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> &quot;At first we thought that this was coincidence,&quot; said ArchilPavlenishvili, chief investigator of Georgia's anti-smuggling team. &quot;But since </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">all of these cases were connected with Abkhazia</span></span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, it </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">suggests that the stuff was stolen recently from one particular place. </span></span><em><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">But we have no idea where</span></em><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. &quot;</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Days later, more evidence turned up when Turkish media reported the arrest of three Turkish men with a radioactive substance in the capital, Ankara. Police seized 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) of cesium-135, the same material seized in January in Tbilisi.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Georgian officials said the suspects were residents of Germany and driving a car with German plates, but that the material had come from Abkhazia. Turkish authorities said the men had entered Turkey from Georgia. Information provided by German authorities led to the arrest in June of five suspects in Georgia with 9 vials of cesium-135 that looked very similar to the vials seized in January.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> The Batumi investigation started after the arrest of two men in the city of Kutaisi in February 2011 year with a small quantity of two radioactive materials stolen from an abandoned Soviet helicopter factory, according to Georgian officials. The men said that a businessman, SoslanOniani, had encouraged them to sell the material.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">¶</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: windowtext;">A striking parallel can be seen in the discussion surrounding crude nuclear weapons production and whether sub-national groups will succeed in producing them. Unsuccessful state nuclear programs (e.g., the Iraqi’s are often cited as evidence of the difficulties of establishing reliable nuclear weapons programs. Unfortunately, this line of reasoning may lead to underestimating the threat from nuclear terrorists. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">It is important to recognize the</span> technical opportunities available and the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">limited skills required for the successful production of a crude nuclear explosive device</span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">. In fact, there is a good deal of misunderstanding about the ease with which a sub-national group could fabricate a nuclear explosive. As with biological weapons</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">no basic research is required to construct a nuclear weapon</span></span><span style="background: yellow; color: windowtext;">.</span><span style="color: windowtext;"> Luis W. Alvarez, a prominent nuclear weapons scientist in the Manhattan Project, has argued that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">it is not difficult to set off explosive using</span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">highly enriched uranium (</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">HEU</span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">). With modern weapons-grade uranium, the background neutron rate is so low that terrorists, if they have such materials, would have a good chance of setting off a high-yield explosion simply by dropping one half of the material onto the other half. Most people seem unaware that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if separated HEU is at hand it’s a trivial job to set off a nuclear explosion… [and] even a high school kid could make a bomb in short order.</span><span style="color: windowtext;">Not all weapons scientists would go so far as to argue that a high school student could make a bomb, but the </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">technical capabilities to set off an explosion using nuclear materials should</span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">certainly</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">be considered as within reach for</span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">some</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">terrorists</span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">. Moreover, terrorists may also be attracted to a crude nuclear weapons option due to the low radiation levels associated with HEU. In contrast to biological materials for weapons, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">fresh </span><span style="color: windowtext;">(unirradiated) </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">uranium material can be handled unshielded without protective measures</span><span style="color: windowtext;">. HEU thus provides a convenient material for weapons production for groups with limited resources and no access to advanced laboratories. Uranium was indeed the material of choice for both the Hiroshima bomb and the South African nuclear weapons program. “Little Boy,” the HEU bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, was triggered by a simple “gun” mechanism. A small, slug shaped piece of uranium was fired down a barrel into a larger, cup-shaped piece of heu. This elementary design generated a destructive force of about 15 kilotons (kt)—the equivalent of 15,000 tons of TNT. South Africa produced six nuclear devices based on the simple uranium gun-type principle while under the constraints of an international embargo, and thus having to rely on its own resources. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">nuclear weapons</span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">produced more than 50 years ago represented sophisticated technology and science </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">at that time. Today these weapons are not only old, they are primitive. Their <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">designs are well known</span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">form the scientific literature. Even lectures that were given to the physicists of the Manhattan Project at its commencement have now been published. Likewise, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">within the information swamp of the internet, potential nuclear weapons producers can find some useful sites</span><span class="underline">. </span><span style="color: windowtext;">The detailed weapons descriptions remain classified; however, Frank Barnaby has argued that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a competent group of physicists</span><span style="color: windowtext;">and engineers, given adequate resources and acesss to literature</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, would have little difficulty in designing a fission weapons from scratch. They would not need to access any classified information</span><span style="color: windowtext;">. Indeed, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to reveal the potential of clandestine nuclear bomb production, nuclear scientists have presented technical outlines of crude gun-type weapons based on readily available commercial equipment and explosives</span><span style="color: windowtext;">.

To counter this threat, Congress passed a law five years ago mandating that by July 2012, all maritime cargo bound for the United States must be scanned before it is loaded on ships.

<span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by the country attacked in the first place, would not necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds imaginable. Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether nuclear terrorism should ever be regarded as belonging in the category of truly existential threats. A contrast can be drawn here with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear exchange between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these weapons in significant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the twenty-first century might bring would fade into insignificance alongside considerations of what a general nuclear war would have wrought in the Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as the major nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of nuclear weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a truly awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state possessors themselves. But these two nuclear worlds—a non-state actor nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange—are not necessarily separable. It is just possible that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">some sort of terrorist attack, and </span><em>especially</em> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">an act of nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a chain of events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapons</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">between two or more of the states that possess them. In this context, today’s and tomorrow’s terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the early Cold War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals who were seen as raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war between the superpowers started by third parties. These risks were considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem. It may require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially plausible situation where an act of nuclear terrorism could lead to such a massive inter-state nuclear war. For example, in the event of a terrorist nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered just how Russia and/or China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not least because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far too responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist behavior that could just as easily threaten them as well. Some possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">, </span></span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">how might the United States react if it was thought</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">or</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">discovered that the fissile material used in the act</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">of nuclear terrorism</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">had come from Russian stocks</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">,40 and if for some reason Moscow denied any responsibility for nuclear laxity? </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> correct </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">attribution of that nuclear material to a particular country might not be a case of science fiction</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> given the observation by Michael May et al. that while the debris resulting from a nuclear explosion would be “spread over a wide area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable, identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of information can be obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the explosion, the materials used and, most important … some indication of where the nuclear material came from.”41 Alternatively, if the act of nuclear terrorism came as a complete surprise, and American officials refused to believe that a terrorist group was fully responsible (or responsible at all)</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;"> suspicion would shift immediately to state possessors.</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> Ruling out Western ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably Israel and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a very short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program continues, and possibly Pakistan. But at what stage would Russia and China be definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear Cluedo? In particular, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if the act of nuclear terrorism occurred against a backdrop of existing tension in Washington’s relations with Russia and/or China,</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> and at a time when threats had already been traded between these major powers, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would officials and political leaders </span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">not be</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> tempted to assume the worst? Of course</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, the chances of this occurring would only seem to increase if the United States was already involved in some sort of limited armed conflict with Russia and/or China, or if they were confronting each other from a distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments may seem at the present time. The reverse might well apply too: </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">should a nuclear terrorist attack occur in Russia or China during a period of</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> heightened tension or </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">even limited conflict with the United States</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">,</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> could Moscow and Beijing resist the pressures that might rise domestically to consider the United States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of the attack? Washington’s early response to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own soil might also raise the possibility of an unwanted (and nuclear aided) confrontation with Russia and/or China. For example, in the noise and confusion during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist nuclear attack, the U.S. president might be expected to place the country’s armed forces, including its nuclear arsenal, on a higher stage of alert. In such a tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of reality, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">it is</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> just </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">possible that Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intentions to use force</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (and possibly nuclear force) </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">against them</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. In that situation, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the temptations to preempt such actions might grow</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, although it must be admitted that any preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response. As part of its initial response to the act of nuclear terrorism (as discussed earlier) Washington might decide to order a significant conventional (or nuclear) retaliatory or disarming attack against the leadership of the terrorist group and/or states seen to support that group. Depending on the identity and especially the location of these targets, Russia and/or China might interpret such action as being far too close for their comfort, and potentially as an infringement on their spheres of influence and even on their sovereignty. One far-fetched but perhaps not impossible scenario might stem from a judgment in Washington that some of the main aiders and abetters of the terrorist action resided somewhere such as Chechnya, perhaps in connection with what Allison claims is the “Chechen insurgents’ … long-standing interest in all things nuclear.”42 American pressure on that part of the world would almost certainly raise alarms in Moscow that might require a degree of advanced consultation from Washington that the latter found itself unable or unwilling to provide. There is also the question of how other nuclear-armed states respond to the act of nuclear terrorism on another member of that special club. It could reasonably be expected that following a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States, both Russia and China would extend immediate sympathy and support to Washington and would work alongside the United States in the Security Council. But there is just a chance, albeit a slim one, where the support of Russia and/or China is less automatic in some cases than in others. For example, what would happen if the United States wished to discuss its right to retaliate against groups based in their territory? If, for some reason, Washington found the responses of Russia and China deeply underwhelming, (neither “for us or against us”) might it also suspect that they secretly were in cahoots with the group, increasing (again perhaps ever so slightly) the chances of a major exchange. If the terrorist group had some connections to groups in Russia and China, or existed in areas of the world over which Russia and China held sway, and if Washington felt that Moscow or Beijing were placing a curiously modest level of pressure on them, what conclusions might it then draw about their culpability? If Washington decided to use, or decided to threaten the use of, nuclear weapons, the responses of Russia and China would be crucial to the chances of avoiding a more serious nuclear exchange. They might surmise, for example, that while the act of nuclear terrorism was especially heinous and demanded a strong response, the response simply had to remain below the nuclear threshold. It would be one thing for a non-state actor to have broken the nuclear use taboo, but an entirely different thing for a state actor, and indeed the leading state in the international system, to do so. If Russia and China felt sufficiently strongly about that prospect, there is then the question of what options would lie open to them to dissuade the United States from such action: and as has been seen over the last several decades, the central dissuader of the use of nuclear weapons by states has been the threat of nuclear retaliation. If some readers find this simply too fanciful, and perhaps even offensive to contemplate, it may be informative to reverse the tables. Russia, which possesses an arsenal of thousands of nuclear warheads and that has been one of the two most important trustees of the non-use taboo, is subjected to an attack of nuclear terrorism. In response, Moscow places its nuclear forces very visibly on a higher state of alert and declares that it is considering the use of nuclear retaliation against the group and any of its state supporters. How would Washington view such a possibility? Would it really be keen to support Russia’s use of nuclear weapons, including outside Russia’s traditional sphere of influence? And if not, which seems quite plausible, what options would Washington have to communicate that displeasure? If China had been the victim of the nuclear terrorism and seemed likely to retaliate in kind, would the United States and Russia be happy to sit back and let this occur? </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">In the charged atmosphere immediately after a nuclear terrorist attack,</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">how would the attacked country respond to pressure from other major nuclear powers not to respond in kind? The phrase “how dare they tell us what to do” immediately springs to mind. Some might even go so far as to interpret this concern as a tacit form of sympathy or support for the terrorists. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">This might not help the chances of nuclear restraint.</span></span><br />

Therefore, to prop up the battered currencies of South Korea and other East Asian countries is vital for the survival of the industrialized world. --The collapse of South Korean and other East Asian economies will eliminate their ability to import goods from abroad. At present, the US produces high-value goods like machinery, airplanes and defense weapons etc. East Asia, having the sizeable economies and high per capita income, is one of the major markets for the US. If US exports suffer, not only its balance of trade will tilt against it--having serious economic implications-- but also its production will suffer giving rise to recession.
