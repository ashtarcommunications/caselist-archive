WASHINGTON (Kyodo) -- <span class="CardText-Underlined">The <span style="background: aqua;">planned transfer</span> of some U.S. Marines from Okinawa <span style="background: aqua;">to Guam faces a financial hurdle as the U.S. government considers it will be impossible to repay a Japanese loan to finance infrastructure projects needed for the transfer of the Marines to the </span>U.S. Pacific <span style="background: aqua;">territory</span>, bilateral diplomatic sources said Friday.</span>
… As a long delay in the transfer could adversely affect the bilateral alliance, the Japanese government has not ruled out the possibility of shouldering the infrastructure-building costs, the sources said//.//

**Contention Four: A Reality Check**
**The negative will attempt to convince you that the plan is undesirable by appealing to far-fetched scenarios of global destruction – we ask that you remain skeptical of their convoluted internal link chains.**
**FIRST—“there’s always a risk” is not a reason to vote negative – low probability internal link chains should not be used as an excuse to reject the plan.**

First, and foremost, <span style="font-size: 9pt;">**__we need to realize that some risks are so trivial that they are simply not meaningful.__**</span>

<span style="font-size: 9pt;">**__…__**</span> <span class="CardText-Underlined">Just as we ignore these risks in our own lives, we should be willing to ignore minimal risks in debates.</span>

**Two—rejecting low probability internal link chains is key to rational policymaking—accumulated experience proves that appeals to the possibility of catastrophic causal chains should not influence our decision-making**.

However, it would not be feasible to take such possibilities into account in all decisions that we make.
…<span class="Highlighted">. The same applies to technological, economic, social, and political systems</span>, although our knowledge about their resilience towards various disturbances has not been sufficiently systematized.

**Three—disregard the negative’s pleas for you to “judge normally” and reject their absurd internal link chains – improving risk calculation is key to meaningful education in debate.**

**THE AFFIRMATIVE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFENDING THE RESOLUTION – THE JUDGE SHOULD VOTE AFFIRMATIVE IF THE RESOLUTION IS PROVEN DESIRABLE AND NEGATIVE IF THE RESOLUTION IS PROVEN UNDESIRABLE.**

**THE AFFIRMATIVE IS A HASTY GENERALIZATION – THE PLAN IS NOT A REPRESENTATIVE EXAMPLE OF THE RESOLUTION.**
Nancy ADAMS AND Tim WILKINS, Debaters at Trinity University, 1987 [“The Role Of Justification In Topic Analysis,” Contemporary Argumentation & Debate, Volume 8, Available Online at [[http://www.cedadebate.org/CAD/1987_adams_and_wilkins.pdf]], Accessed 10-02-2008, p. 22]
Affirmative teams are often guilty of not presenting their arguments defending the topic at a resolutional level...the probable truth of the whole resolutional hypothesis.

**FIRST—PRESUMPTION: THE AFFIRMATIVE HAS NOT MET THEIR PRIMA FACIA BURDEN – PROVING ONE EXAMPLE OF THE RESOLUTION DESIRABLE DOES NOT PROVE THE RESOLUTION DESIRABLE.**
Jeffrey T. BILE, Director of Debate at Southern Illinois University, 1987 [“When The Whole Is Greater Than The Sum Of The Parts: The Implications Of Holistic Resolutional Focus,” Contemporary Argumentation & Debate, Volume 8, Available Online at [[http://www.cedadebate.org/CAD/1987_bile.pdf]], Accessed 10-02-2008, p. 12]
The second implication is that arguments from subset are not prima facie...other side's use of the "counterwarrant."

**SECOND—EDUCATION: RESOLUTIONAL FOCUS PROVIDES SUPERIOR PEDAGOGICAL BENEFITS – FOCUSING ON SINGULAR EXAMPLES WEAKENS DEBATE’S EDUCATIONAL VALUE.**
Jeffrey T. BILE, Director of Debate at Southern Illinois University, 1987 [“When The Whole Is Greater Than The Sum Of The Parts: The Implications Of Holistic Resolutional Focus,” Contemporary Argumentation & Debate, Volume 8, Available Online at [[http://www.cedadebate.org/CAD/1987_bile.pdf]], Accessed 10-02-2008, p. 9]
Holistic resolutional focus is pedagogically preferable to the parametric approach...general education for a number of reasons.

==Critiques== 
===Violence K=== 

__**SUBPOINT A: GUNS DON’T KILL PEOPLE, PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE**__
**THE ASSUMPTION THAT CIRCUMSTANCES CAUSE VIOLENCE IS MISGUIDED – EVERY VIOLENT ACT REQUIRES AN INDIVIDUAL TO CHOOSE TO COMMIT VIOLENCE.**
Susanne KAPPELER, Lecturer in English at the University of East Anglia (UK) and freelance writer, 1995 ["Violence and the will to violence," The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, Published by Polity Press (Cambridge, UK), [[http://debatecoaches.org/wiki/index.php/Special:BookSources/0745613047|ISBN 0745613047]], p. 1-2]
Violence is a ubiquitous reality in our society … The circumstances identified may differ according to the politics of the explainers, but the method of explanation remains the same.

__**SUBPOINT B: THE DISPLACEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY**__
**THE AFFIRMATIVE’S APPROACH IS A FORM OF COLLECTIVE VICTIM-BLAMING THAT STIGMATIZES ENTIRE GROUPS IN ORDER TO EXONERATE INDIVIDUAL PERPETRATORS – THEIR FLAWED METHODOLOGY DISPLACES RESPONSIBILITY AND TURNS THE CASE – THEY HAVE MISIDENTIFIED THE CAUSE OF THEIR HARMS.**
Susanne KAPPELER, Lecturer in English at the University of East Anglia (UK) and freelance writer, 1995 ["Violence and the will to violence," The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, Published by Polity Press (Cambridge, UK), [[http://debatecoaches.org/wiki/index.php/Special:BookSources/0745613047|ISBN 0745613047]], p. 2-3]
While consideration of mitigating circumstances has its rightful place in a court of law trying (and defending) an offender, this does not automatically make it an adequate or sufficient practice for political analysis … It is a version of collective victim-blaming, of stigmatizing entire social strata as potential hotbeds of violence, which rests on and perpetuates the mainstream division of society into so-called marginal groups — the classic clienteles of social work and care politics (and of police repression) — and an implied ‘centre’ to which all the speakers, explainers, researchers and carers themselves belong, and which we are to assume to be a zone of non-violence.

__**SUBPOINT C: THE MOMENT OF DECISION**__
**THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO ADOPT A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO VIOLENCE. INSTEAD OF VIEWING VIOLENCE AS A PRODUCT OF CIRCUMSTANCES, WE SHOULD INTERROGATE THE MOMENT OF DECISION WHEN INDIVIDUALS CHOOSE TO COMMIT VIOLENCE. THIS METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH ENABLES EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE TO THE VIOLENT IDEOLOGY OF THE AFFIRMATIVE AND IS A NECESSARY PRECONDITION TO REMEDYING THE HARMS THEY HAVE OUTLINED.**
Susanne KAPPELER, Lecturer in English at the University of East Anglia (UK) and freelance writer, 1995 ["Violence and the will to violence," The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, Published by Polity Press (Cambridge, UK), [[http://debatecoaches.org/wiki/index.php/Special:BookSources/0745613047|ISBN 0745613047]], p. 5-7]
A politics aiming at a change in people’s behaviour would require political work that is very much more cumbersome and very much less promising of success than is the use of state power and social control … Ideology, however, is not just made by others; we are all of us subjects of ideology — as the producers of our own thinking and as the recipients of other people’s discourse — unless we resist such ideological structures of thought and discourse in a continual critique of ideology itself.

__**SUBPOINT D: START WITH THE “I” WORLD**__
**FIRST – THE AFFIRMATIVE’S INFATUATION WITH INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AT THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT OBSCURES OUR INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIOLENCE – THIS ORGANIZED IRRESPONSIBILITY CONSTITUTES A WILLED REFUSAL TO MEANINGFULLY RESIST VIOLENCE. WE SHOULD BEGIN NOT WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF WHAT OTHERS SHOULD DO BUT WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF WHAT WE SHOULD DO.**
Susanne KAPPELER, Lecturer in English at the University of East Anglia (UK) and freelance writer, 1995 ["Violence and the will to violence," The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, Published by Polity Press (Cambridge, UK), [[http://debatecoaches.org/wiki/index.php/Special:BookSources/0745613047|ISBN 0745613047]], p. 10-11]
‘We are the war’ does not mean that the responsibility for a war is shared collectively and diffusely by an entire society — which would be equivalent to exonerating warlords and politicians and profiteers or, as Ulrich Beck says, upholding the notion of ‘collective irresponsibility’, where people are no longer held responsible for their actions, and where the conception of universal responsibility becomes the equivalent of a universal acquittal.6 … We share in the responsibility for this war and its violence in the way we let them grow inside us, that is, in the way we shape ‘our feelings, our relationships, our values’ according to the structures and the values of war and violence.

**SECOND – VOTE NEGATIVE TO BETRAY THE AFFIRMATIVE'S VISION OF GLOBAL TRANSFORMATION. ONCE WE GIVE UP OUR FETISH FOR GLOBAL VISIONS, WE CAN BEGIN TO CHANGE THE ONLY WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE – THE WORLD OF THE HERE AND NOW.**
Jayan NAYAR, Faculty of Law at the University of Warwick (UK), 1999 [“Symposium: Re-Framing International Law For The 21st Century: Orders Of Inhumanity,” Transnational Law & Contemporary Problems (9 Transnat'l L. & Contemp. Probs. 599), Fall, Available Online via Lexis-Nexis]
IV. A WORLD FOR TRANSFORMATION: TWO POEMS … This is, perhaps, the essential message of Mahatmas.

**FINALLY – INSTEAD OF VIEWING VIOLENCE AS SOMETHING “OUT THERE,” WE SHOULD FOCUS ON OUR OWN OPPORTUNITIES TO CHOOSE VIOLENCE OR RESISTANCE – THIS RECONCEPTUALIZATION IS A NECESSARY PREREQUISITE TO EFFECTIVE POLITICAL CHANGE.**
Susanne KAPPELER, Lecturer in English at the University of East Anglia (UK) and freelance writer, 1995 ["Violence and the will to violence," The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, Published by Polity Press (Cambridge, UK), [[http://debatecoaches.org/wiki/index.php/Special:BookSources/0745613047|ISBN 0745613047]], p. 18-20]
There cannot therefore in the context of specific women’s actions be continued and undifferentiated talk of ‘women’s powerlessness’ — viewed simply in relation to men, the state, the power of leading capitalists or any other more powerful groups which can always be found … It is a most political question, and a most political decision.

===Schmitt K=== 

__**SUBPOINT A: FRIENDS AND ENEMIES**__
**THE AFFIRMATIVE ECHOES THE FAMILIAR LIBERALIST COMMITMENT TO UNIVERSAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW AND THEREBY OBSCURES THE POLITICAL REALITY OF A FRIEND/ENEMY DICHOTOMY. THIS DENIAL OF A STABLE AND PUBLIC ENEMY CREATES A VOID IN OUR OWN IDENTITY BECAUSE ARTICULATING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE WHO ARE FRIENDS AND THOSE WHO ARE ENEMIES IS A PREREQUISITE TO DEFINING WHO WE ARE. THE AFFIRMATIVE PROJECT COLLAPSES THE POLITICAL AND UNDERMINES THE VERY FOUNDATION FOR HUMAN EXISTENCE.**
S. Parvez MANZOOR, Ph.D., Islamic Author, Writer, and Researcher based in Stockholm, Sweden and Member of the Board of Advisors of the Institute of Islamic Political Thought, 2000 [“The Sovereignty of the Political: Carl Schmitt and the Nemesis of Liberalism,” Date Provided by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, Available Online at [[http://www.algonet.se/~pmanzoor/CarlSchmitt.htm]], Accessed 12-19-2005]
The totalizing thrust of Schmitt's argument is directed against liberalism, which by the postulation of a false universalism, according to him, obscures the existentially paramount nature of politics and replaces it with the struggle for purely formal notions of rights … As for liberalism's moral claim to universal humanism, Schmitt is mercilessly candid: 'The concept of humanity is an especially useful ideological instrument of imperial expansion, and in its ethical-humanitarian form it is a specific vehicle of economic imperialism.'

__**SUBPOINT B: GLOBAL PSYCHOSIS**__
**THE DENIAL OF A POLITICAL ENEMY CULMINATES IN A GLOBAL PSYCHOSIS THAT MULTIPLIES LITTLE WARS AND SUSTAINS GENOCIDAL VIOLENCE. A WORLD WITHOUT A STABLE ENEMY IS INFINITELY WORST THAN A WORLD FULL OF ENEMIES – IT OPENS THE FLOODGATES TO UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF VIOLENCE THAT DWARF THE CONFLICTS OF THE STATUS QUO.**
Kenneth REINHARD, Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature at UCLA, 2004 [“Towards a Political-Theology of the Neighbor,” Draft of Chapter later published in Neighbor: Three Inquiries in Political Theology, Available Online at [[http://www.cjs.ucla.edu/Mellon/Towards_Political_Theology.pdf]], Accessed 12-19-2005]
If the concept of the political is defined, as Carl Schmitt does, in terms of the Enemy/Friend opposition, the world we find ourselves in today is one from which the political may have already disappeared, or at least has mutated into some strange new shape … The rhetoric of the so-called “war on terror” is a sign of the disappearance of the traditional, localizable enemy: the terrorist does not have the stabilizing function that Schmitt associates with the enemy, but to declare war on him is to attempt to resuscitate him, to breathe life into the animus of the enemy.

__**SUBPOINT C: THE ALTERNATIVE**__
**RATHER THAN ATTEMPT TO SUBJUGATE THE POLITICAL TO BENEVOLENT IDEAS LIKE PEACE, LAW, AND MORALITY, WE SHOULD EMBRACE THE FRIEND/ENEMY DICHOTOMY. THIS INTERVENTION INTO THE SPHERE OF POLITICS IS KEY TO OUR SURVIVAL.**
Julien FREUND, French Intellectual and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Strasbourg, 1995 [“Schmitt’s Political Thought,” Telos: A Quarterly Journal of Critical Thought, Issue 102, Winter, Available Online via Academic Search Elite]
A distinction Schmitt frequently mentions in his writings without, however, devoting any particular chapter to it is that between the potestas directa and potestas indirecta whose protagonists were, according to Schmitt, Hobbes and Ballarmin respectively … Only a weak people will disappear."[20]

===Russian Engagement Counterplan (U.S.-Russian relations advantages)=== 


Text: The United States federal government should engage in an arms dialogue with Russia in order to revive the Nuclear Arms Reduction Process. The United States federal government should offer to Russia that the U.S. delay their Missile Defense Deployment Program in Central Europe by two years.
