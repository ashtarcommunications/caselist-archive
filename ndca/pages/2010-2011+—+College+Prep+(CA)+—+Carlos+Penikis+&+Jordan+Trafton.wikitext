Our military presence is extensive—it spans every nation on the globe and touches everyone’s lives—just ask somebody living near 
Futenma of Fallujah. But, this presence is only possible because vast supplies of resources. And those resources are the product of theft—Native Americans are exploited every day and exposed to dangerous chemicals to feed American imperialism.
Ward Churchill, American Writer and Political Activist, former professor of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_studies|ethnic studies]] at the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder|University of Colorado at Boulder]], Routledge 03 Acts of Rebellion: The Ward Churchill Reader pg 113 [ev]
Such "savings" accrue to U.S. … than high sulfur anthracite coal.
The American colonization of Native lands is the root cause of militarism abroad—denial of this history of violence ensures that it will be repeated.
Street 2004 (Paul, Author, “Those Who Deny the Crimes of the Past Reflections on American Racist Atrocity Denial, 1776-2004”, March 11, accessed online p. L/N)
It is especially important to … the means and motive to do so. 
We are living in a society of terrorists. The US regularly commits crimes against humanity, and of course that breeds blowback. We must resist this violence.
Ward Churchill, American Writer and Political Activist, former professor of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_studies|ethnic studies]] at the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder|University of Colorado at Boulder]], 03 On the Justice of Roosting Chickens: Reflections on the Consequences of U.S. Imperial Arrogance and Criminality pg 16-17
This brings a second level of the … and national self-concepts.
The silence of intellectuals on the oppression of the Indians will not make it go away. The United States is an entity formed on colonized land and as long as it controls the land, it will have the legitimacy to do whatever it pleases. Decolonization can rupture America’s claim to legitimacy and break down other forms of oppression.
Churchill 1996 (Ward, American Writer and Political Activist, former professor of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_studies|ethnic studies]] at the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder|University of Colorado at Boulder]], “I Am Indigenist,” From a Native Son, pg 520-530)
I’ll debunk some of this nonsense in a …, homophobic, militaristic order on non-Indians. 
Every day, we are complicit with this violence. Do not be a Good German—we call on you to support us in resisting this genocide of Native peoples. Otherwise, extinction is inevitable.
Lilian Friedberg, American Indian Quarterly vol. 24, No. 3 Summer 2000 “Dare to Compare: Americanizing the Holocaust”
Attempts on the part of American …analogies are flawed on several counts.
Beacon will argue that we have to prioritize issues like slavery, but that misses the point. We should provide first priority to First Americans—anything else ensures continued oppression—only we get to the root cause of injustice.
Churchill 1996 (Ward, American Writer and Political Activist, former professor of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_studies|ethnic studies]] at the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder|University of Colorado at Boulder]], “I Am Indigenist,” From a Native Son, pg 89-94)
The question which inevitably arises … we all worked on attaining it? 
We should challenge racism, but it can’t come at the cost of ignoring the colonization of America. We must resist violence by any means necessary—much like what happened to the Soviet Union, our dissent in this round can help unravel the United States from the inside out and bring liberation.
Ward Churchill, American Writer and Political Activist, former professor of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_studies|ethnic studies]] at the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder|University of Colorado at Boulder]], 03 On the Justice of Roosting Chickens: Reflections on the Consequences of U.S. Imperial Arrogance and Criminality pg 274-276 
In this connection, the question …must “demand the impossible.”
Beacon’s got it right when they play That’s War—this is a war, all around us, and we are in the battleground. But the cause we fight for can’t be reduced to any one thing—slavery or sexism, class or race. To participate in only one struggle is to prop up the structures of oppression in many others.
“Therefore, Carlos and I stand in unity with all other causes committed to the liberation of Native North America and the struggle for justice against America’s global empire. Via our 1AC, we ask you to join us.”
Watakpe and Ostrovskty 6 (Wanbli and Paula, Lakota warrior and former lecturer at UC Berkeley, PhD in Microbiology, Gwarth-E-Lass: Stick Standing Strong, in Igniting a Revolution: Voices in Defense of the Earth ed. Steven Best and Anthony J. Nocella II, pg 176-177) cp
George W. Bush, the latest Emperor, is well … beginning of this country.
Historical amnesia of colonial dispossession maintains white supremacy: The most important necessary cause of white supremacy is white possession: The idea that we can take something and say “that’s my property” by right. The very act of starting with slavery & migration hides the reality of where we live. Rather than begin with slavery, our historical analysis of white supremacy starts with and centers appropriation of indigenous land and its relationship to white possessiveness.
Moreton-Robinson 8 (Aileen, “Transnational Whiteness Matters”, p. kindle)
Despite the colonial history of the United States…and to its continued existence. 
Prioritizing the genocide and dispossession of Native Americans is a prerequisite to all other critiques—we must even reorient our personal narratives of the world, or our politics will ultimately fail

Contention Two: The COIN Doctrine is bad

COIN tries to force a central government on Afghanistan—that ensures its failure.

The war in Afghanistan is not … government can win the loyalty of the population.

COIN tries to remake Afghanistan in America’s image—that strategy is bankrupt.

This attempt to make others in our image causes unending violence.
Robert Lifton 2003, Superpower Syndrome
The National Security Strategy is … another version of the ownership of death.

The biopolitical underpinnings of counterinsurgency are the same coercive politics that inform racism and extermination—revealing the internal contradictions of racialized biopolitics is key to prevent extinction.

His reporting from Iraq in 2008 also garnered honorable mention in the Edgar A.

Each year the Alsop Award recognizes a journalist who has made "an exceptional contribution to balanced and informed coverage on national security and intelligence-related issues." Kitfield also received the 2000 Edwin Hood Award for Diplomatic Correspondence given annually by the National Press Club to recognize excellence in reporting on diplomatic and foreign policy issues. Citing Kitfield's insightful writing on trans-Atlantic issues, the German Marshall Fund awarded him a Peter R.

==Dialectical Materialism 1NC== 
Theory cannot bring liberation.
The affirmative is a reincarnation of the descent into discourse that Marx criticized as a turn away from material change in systems of economic oppression. The affirmative’s shallow belief in the power of discourse and transformative potential of their performance obfuscates the fact that we must revolutionize the existing world, not the mental one, if we are to see any improvement.

The unsurpassable objectivity...tolerable, justifiable, and naturalized.

The new elite--their appeal to discourse negates the necessity of changing material conditions and is merely a self-righteous attempt of intellectuals t ocenter themselves as a kind of hero, as the new subject of social change, over and opposed to those actually oppressed and disenfranchised.
Rene Francisco Poitevin, Doctoral Candidate in Sociology at UC Davis, member of the SR [Socialist Review], 2001, Socialist Review, “The end of anti-capitalism as we knew it: Reflections on postmodern Marxism,” [[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3952/is_200101/ai_n8932891/]]

Sherry 96 (Suzanna, Professor of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at the University of Minnesota, "The Sleep of Reason," 84 Geo. L.J. 453)
Enlightenment epistemology, antirational...a truth to power.

Our alternative is to "Reject the affirmative for their focus on _ in favor of a Marxist analysis of _." Not only can this empower us to see and understand inequality in society, and see how is caused by _, but it allows us to take proactive action to prevent injustice rather than just change the ways we think. only this can truly create an egalitarian society.

This identification of the person...about the primacy of identity.

===**AT: Framework**=== 
This round matters—the ways we as students approach knowledge is key. Post-al pedagogy teaches students useless knowing rather than revolutionary knowledge, turning them into willing fuel for the workforce. Only structural education can produce revolution.

===**AT: Perm**=== 
The perm is impossible—our argument is that the affirmative is factually wrong in their understanding of the world; you can’t combine two conflicting theories of how the world works.
