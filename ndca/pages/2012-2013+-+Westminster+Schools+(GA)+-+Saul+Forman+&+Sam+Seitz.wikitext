===1AC Plan=== 

**The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States through a national transportation infrastructure bank.**

===1AC Growth=== 

**Contention one is growth –**

**Specifically the NIB solves through 4 internal links-**

**First is __stimulus__ -** **confidence is collapsing now and destroying investment --- a national infrastructure bank is the __best short term stimulus__ that __doesn’t drive up the deficit__**
**Skidelsky and Martin, 11**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">--- *Emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of Warwick, AND **macroeconomist and bond investor(3/30/2011, Robert Skidelsky and Felix Martin, New York Review of Books, “For a National Investment Bank,” http://www.skidelskyr.com/site/article/for-a-national-investment-bank/, JMP)**</span>

Second is __unemployment__ – it’s triggering a major economic crisis – __outweighs__ the deficit and is best solved by the plan
***jobs deficit outweighs budget deficit comparatively – labor force participation is lowest in three decades**
***alt cause to budget deficit = weak taxes (they are the biggest contributor and outweigh government spending), government spending solves the deficit by employing more people**

This negatively influences the __entire economy__ – prevents a __resilient__ supply chain
***TI accounts for more than a quarter of GDP**
***current transport linkages have bottlenecks due to lack of repair and replacement, that destroys the supply chain**

Protectionism causes __global transition wars__ which heightens the likelihood of every transnational threat

***causes resource wars -> full-scale military encounters erupt with minimal provocation**
***nations divert resources away from domestic problems towards terrorist groups fuels widespread violence via biological + nuclear weapons**

As Schmitt says:
AND
exerting brotherly correction.

**Global liberal governance posits emergencies as in need of linear policy solutions. The world is hardly that simple—there is a nonlinear economy of power and knowledge and dramatic material inequalities. The result of their over-simplification is serial policy failure.**
**Dillon & Reid, 2k** (Michael and Julian, Lecturer at the University of Lancaster and Lecturer on International Politics at University of London, Alternatives: Social Transformation and Humane Governance, Vol. 25 Ish. 1, January-March).

Serial policy failure
AND
Foucauldian "biopower" ways.

**Total security is an impossible paradox. Disorder and insecurity are inevitable because we live in a dangerous world. Efforts to control this fear have resulted in the deaths of millions and the creation of WMDs**

**The alternative is a negative gesture of indifference—we must learn to live with insecurity of the affirmative harms and to restrain our foreign policy. Admitting that everything is dangerous will allow us to break out of the death cycle.**
**Der Derian 98,** (Political Science Professor, University of Massachusetts) 98 (James, On Security, ed: Lipschitz, The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard, Decentering Security).

No other concept
AND
a fearful sameness.

===1NC Util=== 
**All lives infinitely valuable—only ethical option is maximizing number saved**
**Cummisky, 96** (David, professor of philosophy at Bates, Kantian Consequentialism, p. 131)

Finally, even if

saved, the better.


**4) Ethics focus turns case - Focus on guilt-based pancea politics leads to compassion fatigue that results in a net-decrease in ethical acts**
**Moeller, 99** Dr. Susan Moeller is the director of the International Center for Media and the Public Agenda (ICMPA), an academic center that forms a bridge between the College of Journalism and the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, College Park.

It all started
AND
once stood tall.


**5) Consequences outweigh—fierce dogmatism makes them complicit with the evil they criticize**
**Isaac 02** – Professor of political science at Indiana-Bloomington, Director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life, PhD from Yale (Jeffery C., Dissent Magazine, Vol. 49, Iss. 2, “Ends, Means, and Politics,” p. Proquest)

As a result,

**6) Large impacts always outweigh smaller ones – they are using cognitive biases to trick you into being immoral – don’t fall for it**
**YUDKOWSKY 6** (Eliezer, Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, “Cognitive biases potentially affecting judgment of global risks,” forthcoming in //Global Catastrophic Risks//, August 31)*we don’t endorse gendered language used by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Three groups of

**Nye, 86** (Joseph S. 1986; Phd Political Science Harvard. University; Served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs; “Nuclear Ethics” pg. 18-19)

**Their strategy is moral evasion—ignoring consequences condones greater suffering on behalf of their egotistical drive towards a clean conscience**
**Neilsen, 93 (**Kai Nielsen, Professor of Philosophy, University of Calgary, Absolutism and Its Consequentialist Critics, ed. Joram Graf Haber, 1993, p. 170-2)

Forget the levity

make it right.

**Turn: util is vital to protect minority interests**
**Hinman, 98** (Lawrence, professor of philosophy at the University of San Diego, Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory, http://ethics.acusd.edu/Courses/ComputerEthics/Utilitarianism.DOC)

Nevertheless, critical theorists

===AT: Exclusion=== 
**Arguing against the government perspective is critical—it’s key to refining our positions and building bridges with insiders**
**GITLIN 2003** (Todd, Professor of Journalism and Sociology at Colombia and Former President of Students for a Democratic Society, Letters to a Young Activist, 96)

__Insider and outsider__

**First, predictability—ignoring the rez enables infinite frameworks which undermines ability to deeply research and understand arguments**
**Harrigan 08** (Casey, MA Wake Forest, NDT Champion and BA from Michigan State, “Against Dogmatism: a Continued Defense of Switch Side Debate”, Contemporary Argumentation and Debate, Vol. 29 (2008)

A second exception
AND
none can be.

**Alternate modes of knowledge production are awesome, but the target of those ideas should be topical**
**Chandler, 7** David, Professor of History, The possibilities of post-territorial political community, Area, Volume 39, Issue 1, pages 116–119, Marc

This paper argues

**Attacks on social location are equal parts fallacy and discrimination. Vote for arguments, not speakers**
**Kotzee, 10** – Department of Social Policy and Education, Birkbeck College, University of London (Ben, “Poisoning the Well and Epistemic Privilege,” Argumentation, SpringerLink) *NOTE: “poisoning the well” = fallacy where argument is made against the speaker and not the argument

In his paper “Poisoning

situation like this:

**Don’t buy into their “movement”—the aff doesn’t spillover and voting based on institutional privilege collapses their movement. Our framework with an endorsement of community dialogue solves best**
**Atchison and Panetta 9** – *Director of Debate at Trinity University and **Director of Debate at the University of Georgia (Jarrod, and Edward, “Intercollegiate Debate and Speech Communication: Issues for the Future,” The Sage Handbook of Rhetorical Studies, Lunsford, Andrea, ed., 2009, p. 317-334)

The final problem

The mutual contestation we enable solves their offense and generates reasoned moral convictions
Star Muir, 1993. Professor of Communication at George Mason. “A Defense of the Ethics of Contemporary Debate,” Philosophy and Rhetoric 26.4, p. 291-292.

Firm moral commitment
AND
own moral identity.

Replacing these mainstream debate conventions with personal politics just drives power relations underground and makes them harder to confront
Tonn 2005 – associate professor of communications at the University of Maryland (Mari Boor, Rhetoric & Public Affairs, 8.3, “Taking conversation, dialogue, and therapy public”)

This widespread recognition

Yet for some... so-called "managerial class."

===AT: Giroux and Friere=== 
**Giroux and Friere are terrible starting points for education – their role of the ballot is arbitrary and wrong – it has zero potential to effect productive political change. Their method has been tried and failed numerous times in the past**
