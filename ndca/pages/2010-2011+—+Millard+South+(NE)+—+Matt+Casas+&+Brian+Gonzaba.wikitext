When I get older, I will be stronger 
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag  
And then it goes back, and then it goes back 
And then it goes back, 

When I get older, I will be stronger  
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag  
And then it goes back, and then it goes back 
And then it goes back, 

Born to a throne, stronger than Rome 
A violent prone, poor people zone  
But it's my home, all I have known  
Where I got grown, streets we would roam   
Out of the darkness, I came the farthest 
Among the hardest survival  
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak 
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat 

When I get older I will be stronger

And then it goes back, and then it goes back

And then it goes back, 

Let me take you back to where I come from. I come from a family that’s not so typical. My Mom’s side is full blooded Filipino and Mexican. It is from the Philippines that I draw my relation to this year’s resolution. My Grandma used to talk a lot about where she grew up…

She would speak of her sadness walking down the streets after it rained (most people think of rain as cleansing)…no pavement, just dirt or in the case of rain thick mud. In her town you had to walk because vehicles were reserved to two groups of people…the rich and the soldiers. She would speak about their reckless driving…reckless even to the point of children being run down in the streets without second thought by military Jeeps. My Grandmother’s son, my uncle Carlos met the Jeep of his fate at the age of six. 

Seven day funerals, seven days of seeing a whole family and community stay in a cramped church for twelve hours a day, from seven in the morning to seven at night. You realize how much your life is worth living after you attend a funeral in the Philippines. It would seem every time I travel there there’s always a funeral to attend. In this instance it was a moment for reflection upon my whole family, to the military however the uncle I never had… and the child my grandmother never saw grow up would remain invisible. Not good enough to make it on some paper report, not even good enough for a bouquet of flowers sent to my grandmother.

In Manila there was a military base, in fact the community surrounding it became economically dependent upon it to the point where they forced you to learn English in schools so you can interact with the military better.

The base is where many young and beautiful Filipino women made their income to help support their families. Communities Indoctrinated by the U.S. military presence into careers like prostitution and drug dealing. My grandmother had firsthand experience with these issues forced to watch her less fortunate friends raped and beaten by soldiers on what she called nearly a daily occurrence. 

She says that some of her best friends where prostitutes and that she herself had never participated, however when you’re the oldest in your and the parents are all out of the job…aunts, uncles, her mother and father all out of the job, living in that two bedroom no bathroom house we visit and cry in front of every time we visit there…

I know even if she ever participated she wouldn’t be any less of a person in my eyes. Even today she represents herself as that strong Filipino woman supporting my family, my out of work grandfather, my brother, my sister, two twin cousins and even me. I jumped at the opportunity to talk about this resolution, to stand up with those of us who remain invisible in the eyes of most conceptions of the resolution; the innocent women of Okinawa, the children whose fathers have been displaced in Iraq or Afghanistan, my unknown uncle Carlos, even my grandmother who works hard every day with the remembrance of her experience of military presence where she was from. Thus our interpretation for this debate is that we should be able to discuss the systematic violence that is present in times of war and include the voices of those who are often forgotten. Doing so provides us with the opportunity to stand in solidarity with the oppressed through our revolutionary way of speaking while we debate this year's resolution which states: 
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military and/or police presence in one or more of the following: South Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey.

So many wars, settling scores
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
I heard them say 'love is the way' '
Love is the answer,' that's what they say
But look how they treat us, make us believers 
We fight their battles, then they deceive us
Try to control us, they couldn't hold us 
'Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers 
When I get older I will be stronger

They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag 
And then it goes back, and then it goes back 
And then it goes back, and then is goes

My grandma always told not to forget people, and to always remember that we can make a huge difference even if only in our own lives 
Now that we know we should discuss our own relationships to the resolution in the community in which we live in and the community in which we debate in, we should aim the discussion to the plight of systematic violence that oppresses us while stepping away from ideologies that ignore the many forms of violence within the policies we construct. 
//Mumia Abu-Jamal 1998 [“A QUIET AND DEADLY VIOLENCE,” 9/19/98, [[http://www.mumia.nl/TCCDMAJ/quietdv.htm]]]//
__It has often been observed that America is a truly violent nation … or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world."__

She still tells me to this day and it echoes in my mind constantly that if something seams wrong I should take a step away from it and take a step toward resolving it

Thus, the role ballot for this debate represents a step away from the ideologies that continue to justify masking over and ignoring wide ranging structural violence and oppression within our discussions of the resolution, the ballot acts as an endorsement for discursive action by including And hearing those who often become invisible to us in our discussions 

Paulo Freire in 1970 gives us insight to how our discussions that emphasizes turning our discourse and activism into true action is an important part of our revolutionary goals – one that is work, that is praxis necessary to transform the ways in which we approach our views based upon this resolution 
//Paulo Friere, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Chapter 1, educator and director of the Department of Cultural Extension of Recife University,1970//
__An unauthentic word, ... in a prescriptive act which robs others of their words.__

When I get older I will be stronger 
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag 
And then it goes back, and then it goes back 
And then it goes back, and then is goes  

When I get older I will be stronger

**In order for us to focus on systematic violence, there are two crucial steps we must take:**

**First, we must allow ourselves, including the oppressed, to participate in an epistemological shift by becoming the subject of the debate community's and the world's transformation.

//Paulo Friere, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Chapter 1, educator and director of the Department of Cultural Extension of Recife University,1970//
__It is absolutely essential ... rather than as a road to liberation.__

**Second, we must escape the suppressive ideology that controls our discussions of the resolution that leads to masking over and ignoring the wide ranging structural violence incorporated in the status-quo.

Thus our interpretation for this debate is that we should be able to discuss systematic violence amongst our peers in our debate community to prove through in round discourse that we have the potential to remove violent representations from our criticisms and provide ourselves with the opportunity to stand in solidarity with the oppressed through our revolutionary way of speaking while discussing this year's resolution.

Our alternative is a rejection of the 1AC's use of the State that ignores wide ranging structural violences. Doing so opens space for discussions about the violence and oppression that is pushed to the bottom of our debate space and to the bottom of our world.

**Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.** 
**-Martin Luther King, Jr., 1963**

**The year is 1994. My mother had just given birth to her very first child in South Omaha. Now, my parents had been feeling a mixed amount of emotions – mostly happiness and fear. Happy for obvious reasons, fearful for less than obvious reasons. My parents would often times become frightened every night as they tuned into the nightly news and heard about the weekly drive by shooting or drug deal gone bad. These events, which the police or television called “isolated incidents”, were usually no more than 5 minutes away from my neighborhood. BANG BANG BANG. Just another “isolated incident” in South Omaha. “Just another Mexican who got mixed up in the wrong crowd” the newsman would say. But nobody asks why or how it would become necessary to get mixed up in the wrong crowds or to sell drugs or to kill. The answer that nobody acknowledges or thinks about is that they do it to survive. To live another day and to die a little later. Life in this community waged constant war, and the streets were the battle field.**

Though I had only experienced this horrific experience, this structural violence, for a short while, my parents remind me to this day of the times that I had experienced it and the times that each of them had. 

**My mother would tell me of the horrors from walking home from school, only to have to wait outside the house for at least an hour while my grandfather – her father – would be beating her mother black and blue. Her father would come home from work everyday drunk, or sober with a bottle of whiskey and not so great intentions. He would drink all of their money away until there was barely enough food to function during the week.**

**My father experienced something a little different. His parents were immigrants from Mexico. His father knew enough English to get by in America, his mother none. So you can imagine the hardship they endured when my grandfather died while my father was only seven years old. He and his five year old brother were left with his non-English-speaking, jobless mother and was forced to become the man of the house – the primary caregiver at the age of seven years old.**
**It's funny, not so long ago I became the same man on the nightly news that I had come to loathe. I thought that these people that were committing illegal acts were either bad people or just plain stupid. But my mother, my father, others who experience similar circumstances, and even myself, would do the same thing to ensure my family's survival.**
**More specifically, this year's resolution is one that directs attention towards America’s war, occupation, and ultimately its struggle within South Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey, yet it ignores the war and the struggle of the people subject to systematic violence and its occupation within our communities. This year’s resolution makes invisible the structural violence that surrounds our communities to us creating the equivalence of genocide against those subject to such violence.**

<span style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 10pt;">**__It has often been observed that America is a truly violent nation, as shown by the thousands of cases of social and communal violence that occurs daily in the nation. Every year, some 20,000 people are killed by others, and__** **__additional 20,000 folks kill themselves. Add to this the non lethal__** **__violence that Americans daily inflict on each other,__** and we begin to see the tracings of a nation immersed in a fever of violence. But, as remarkable, and harrowing as this level and degree of violence is, it is, by far, not the most violent feature of living in the midst of the American empire. **__We live, equally immersed, and to a deeper degree, in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging "structural" violence, of a kind that destroys human life with a breathtaking ruthlessness.__** Former Massachusetts prison official and writer, Dr. James **__Gilligan observes;"By `structural violence' I mean the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society,__** **__as contrasted by those who are above them.__** Those excess deaths (or at least a demonstrably large proportion of them) are a function of the class structure; and that structure is itself a product of society's collective human choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the society. These are not acts of God. I am contrasting `structural' with `behavioral violence' by which I mean the non-natural deaths and injuries that are caused by specific behavioral actions of individuals against individuals, such as the deaths we attribute to homicide, suicide, soldiers in warfare, capital punishment, and so on." -- (Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New York: Vintage, 1996), 192.) **__This form of violence__**__,__ not covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected media, **__is invisible to us and because of its invisibility, all the more insidious.__** How dangerous is it -- really? Gilligan notes: **__"[E]very fifteen years__**__,__ on the average, **__as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war__** **t**hat caused 232 million deaths; __**and every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews**__ over a six-year period. **__This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world."__** [Gilligan, p. 196]</span>

<span style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 10pt;">**The role of the ballot is to make visible the issues of systematic violence that comes from the way in which the affirmative prioritizes both the impacts and lives of those who are affected by there notions of creating policy.**</span>
<span style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 10pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">**We need to challenge the current invisibility of structural violence amongst our communities. The normal functioning of debate, much like our current functioning of modern American society, constructs a methodological distinction between groups of people, deeming them a part of the in crowd or the out crowd...Discussions are either “topical” or “not-topical” – relevant or irrelevant. This constant question excludes the oppressed from our discussions, further distancing the oppressed from ourselves, contributing to the systematic violence present in the status-quo. This is what leads to systematic violence’s invisibility and inevitability…to a genocide committed against the weak and poor throughout the world. We propose an inclusionary approach through our relationships within our debate community, debate's discursive potential, and the appreciation and acceptance of diverse ways of viewing the world, including the world in which we live in and the world in which we debate in, in order to discontinue the invisibility of structural violence.**</span>

Pg 4-5)
Finally, __**to recognize the operation of structural violence forces us to ask questions about how and why we tolerate it**__, questions which often have painful answers for the privileged elite who unconsciously support it. A final question of this section is **__how and why we allow ourselves to be so oblivious to structural violence.__** Susan Opotow offers an intriguing set of answers, in her article Social Injustice. She argues that **__our normal perceptual/cognitive processes divide people into in-groups and out-groups. Those outside our group lie outside our scope of justice. Injustice that would be instantaneously confronted if it occurred to someone we love or know is barely noticed if it occurs to strangers or those who are invisible or irrelevant.__ __We do not seem to be able to open our minds and our hearts to everyone, so we draw conceptual lines between those who are in and out of our moral circle. Those who fall outside are morally excluded, and become either invisible, or demeaned in some way so that we do not have to acknowledge the injustice they suffer__**__.__ Moral exclusion is a human failing, but Opotow argues convincingly that it is an outcome of everyday social cognition. **__To reduce its nefarious effects, we must be vigilant in noticing and listening to oppressed, invisible, outsiders. Inclusionary thinking can be fostered by relationships, communication, and appreciation of diversity.__** Like Opotow, all the authors in this section point out that **__structural violence is not inevitable if we become aware of its operation, and build systematic ways to mitigate its effects. Learning about structural violence may be discouraging, overwhelming, or maddening, but__** these papers encourage us to step beyond guilt and anger, and begin to think about how to reduce structural violence. All the authors in this section note that **__the same structures (such as global communication and normal social cognition) which feed structural violence, can also be used to empower citizens to reduce it.__**
Our method for taking steps away from the constructions of the 1ac is through our interrogation of society using our own personal history and agency is key to creating movement even if only in this debate space. We refuse to be told we can’t have our own voices in this debate round.

**<span style="color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman";">The act of deciding who gets the right to speak stifles debate and dehumanizes those that it deems unworthy of participation.

<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 8pt;">Dialogue is the encounter between men, mediated by the world, in order to name the world.

If it is in speaking their word that people, by naming the world, transform it dialogue imposes itself as the way by which they achieve significance as human beings. Dialogue is thus an existential necessity. And since dialogue is the encounter in which the united reflection and action of the dialoguers are addressed to the world which is to be transformed and humanized, </span>__<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman";">this dialogue cannot be reduced to the act of one person’s “depositing” ideas in another; nor can it become a simple exchange of ideas to be “consumed” by the discussants</span>__<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 8pt;">. Nor yet is it a hostile, polemical argument between those who are committed neither to the naming of the world, nor to the search for truth, but rather to the imposition of their own truth. Because dialogue is an encounter among women and men who name the world, it must not be a situation where some name on behalf of others. It is an act of creation; it must not serve as a crafty instrument for the domination of one person by another. The domination implicit in dialogue is that of the world by the dialoguers; it is conquest of the world for the liberation of humankind.</span>

**<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman";">And- Extend the Mumia Abu-Jamal evidence from the 1NC: this indicates that systematic issues always become ignored in the status quo political constructions. It is because of systematic violence's invisibility that it becomes easy or convenient for us to forget about the people that seem unimportant to the constructions of our politics...</span>**

**<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman";">Next, extend the Winter and Leighton evidence from the 1NC: This card proves that our criticism must o/w their f/w arguments. It indicates that we have become too comfortable with systematic violence being the norm and because of this we just don’t care anymore or we think we care and take no action toward resolving it. They are either in the in-groups or out-groups... “political or “non-political”... It also says that we must include the voices of the oppressed and their memories into our minds and dissolve the exclusion of systematic violence. The discursive act of debate allows my partner and I, and all of those that too often go ignored to stand together against the invisibility of systematic violence. Our criticism disrupts the current injustice of ignoring systematic violence through noticing and listening to those who become forgotten or excluded. Once we destroy systematic violence's invisibility we can work towards weakening systematic violence… To disrupt the inevitability of it…</span>**

**<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman";">Framework excludes marginal groups from the collective act of debate which is exactly the same ideology that leads to the population at large to exclude those subject to structural violence from their interpretation of being human.

It was cold that night after we just got done eating wings and playing keno at the bar across the street from the apartment we where staying in at the time. My mom wasn’t able to pay the bill on time so our food spoiled in the refrigerator. Luckily we made friends with the owner of the bar. I remember that I was too tired to cross the street so I told my mom to carry me. She did and she smiled at me. Back then that meant the whole world to me, her smile still is probably the most comforting feeling I have ever known in my life. I fell asleep while she was carrying me up the stairs into our apartment and woke up after she set me down on the floor in my favorite spot, the floor right next to the window. She smiled at me again which was what she usually did before she went out. I asked her where she was going, and she told me she was going to go out and pay the bills. I was seven at the time and I knew that she wasn’t really going to go pay the bills, but at the time I thought it would have been better to say nothing. I could have told her that I knew she wasn’t going out just to pay the bills… that I knew the office would’ve been closed at that time of night, and that I knew before she went out she would make a stop by the cabinet above the stove that she told me never to look into… I could have told her that I knew she was selling drugs, but even as a young kid you know that mom is doing what she needs to help you survive. She kissed me good night and left, I fell back asleep and wouldn’t wake up until about a couple hours later. 
**That’s one question you should ask yourself at the end of the round, is it better to say nothing or say something?**

Sirens, lights, sound all leaking through the window, I looked out and saw my mom sitting in the back of a squad car looking down and telling them where I was at. It was then when I heard a knock on the door… I was too afraid to answer though… they knocked again… I still didn’t move… the third knock was the knock right before they knocked in the door. Who was it? Two policemen accompanied by a social worker in a red skirt suit. I tried to run away but I couldn’t, all I wanted was my mother… something the men in blue couldn’t give me.

**Military and police presence doesn’t stay contained in one mere geographical location outside of the US, but instead there is a military policing all of us over here as well… this is something that we think the politics constructed by the affirmative often forgets.**
My last memory in Dallas was when I was seven years old, sitting in the lobby of a waiting room at a boys home for my Grandparents to come pick me up all the way from Omaha Nebraska. On the TV was the News story about a neglectful Mother who was dealing drugs and hanging out with the wrong crowd. The ironic thing is I overheard another parent who was there to claim their child say under their voice “what a horrible mother”… a woman saying this in a place where your children are temporarily taken from you for bad parenting habits. I slept for the whole 12-hour ride up to my grandparent’s house where I am currently living. It wouldn’t be until another six years until I saw my mom again. 
**Quite often we see politics as something outside of ourselves but we never really see the issues which lye inside of us. Or we chose not to see the person who is truly affected by them.**
I had so many questions for her, and I thought about a bunch of things I could have said…but really the only thing I was able to say was “I love you” 
I knew she was fighting for my survival, and although there might have been some alternatives to how she did it, the only thing that matters to me is that she was doing it all for me. 
**We don’t directly affect or change this world around us, but what we can realize is that the change we can make even within this community is a change within ourselves… this change doesn’t have to be sudden, but it can be a gradual effect that resonates into our everyday lives and relationships.**

This is my war; this was the presence in my life that removed me, from my own mother. Maybe I should have told her that I knew she was selling drugs back then, because maybe she wouldn’t have gone out that night… but seeing her again for the first time all I really wanted to say was thank you for all you did for me, and I know that often times life gets hard, and sometimes people don’t always know the whole story about what they are getting into before they take action, or even the reasons behind someone’s actions. 
This is what we chose to affirm the stories and motives behind our actions that too go unseen, and the social stigmas that often times go unnoticed to us and the policies we wish to create, a personalized brand of politics is the thing that you’re voting for at the end of this round. This debate comes down to a decision between the methods in which you choose to be preferable when deciding a brand of politics worth affirming. 
<span style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 10pt;">**<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman";">Our alternative allows us to challenge the current invisibility of structural violence amongst our communities. The normal functioning of debate, much like our current functioning of modern American society, constructs a methodological distinction between groups of people, deeming them a part of the in crowd or the out crowd...Discussions are either “topical” or “not-topical” – relevant or irrelevant. This constant question excludes the oppressed from our discussions, further distancing the oppressed from ourselves, contributing to the systematic violence present in the status-quo. This is what leads to systematic violence’s invisibility and inevitability…to a social genocide committed against the weak and poor throughout the world. We propose an inclusionary approach through our relationships within our debate community, debate's discursive potential, and the appreciation and acceptance of diverse ways of viewing the world, including the world in which we live in and the world in which we debate in, in order to discontinue the invisibility of structural violence.</span>**</span>

boil two cups of water in a sauce pan
add the noodles and cook three minutes 
stir occasionally 
turn off heat, drain excess water
add content of seasoning packet 
stir 
serve immediately for best results 
and that’s how you make 
Top Raman 
Chop up some hot dogs and throw it in the pot
Cause that’s my stuff 
Forget using the stove when you can microwave it in a bowl
Cause that’s my stuff
Find the bottle of hot sauce to spice it up a bit
Cause that’s my stuff
No need to wash dishes either cause you can crush it up in the bag
Now… that’s some real good stuff 
Eating Top Ramen three times a day, every day, seven days a week
Cause mom has no money and that’s all we can afford to eat 
Ain’t that some stuff
In our house top ramen was the only father figure 
The only person putting food on our table
While mom’s just working to keep the lights on 
Sense the money was as absent as dad was 
There was no hope left
The last ounce of essence she had left, was crushed into a powder 
and sealed in a tin foil package
so when you pour it in the mix
it shows the true meaning of soul food
injured by budget cuts so deep 
that mom would stock our cabinets with 24 packs of orange and red 
first aid survival kits 
she was strong like ramen strait out the package
but every time she’d reach her boiling point 
she would go into her room and release her tears into her pot of insecurities 
so we never see her soft side
knowing that the tears she shed make the green in you pockets 
go a little bit faster…
if you just add water 
and the noodles would swell up like your face after you get done crying
strain all the water out, and your left with something so beautiful
how can a man leave someone so beautiful
but the tears keep coming back
how can something so beautiful come from the worst thing that can happen to you 
and our mailbox gets filled and harassed 
by numerous monthly statements instead of child support checks 
I know it’s hard
To always feed us top ramen 
Feeding us the chicken noodle soup of your soul 
Even if you where sick or tired
We are sick and tired
Of your watered down stories telling us everything is going to be all right 
But its all gunna be all right mama
Cause I know all about your beef with the bill collectors 
And I know that I’m but a shrimp compared to your problems
But you would never be contingent to tell us what’s going on
Cause you knew that your problems can only make my noodles taste nasty
Mom raised us with the intention of us being raw men
So every night she would pray with a face full of tears 
And prey to god that we can be men
And that our stomachs are never empty 
She would slave through her graveyard shifts every night so she can make her zeros 
Staring into the night sky singing of her super hero
Except I never had a super hero
We never had a super hero
Going through childhood in a broken home, this soup is our hero
It’s name is top ramen 
Full of the power packed msg 
Which never stood for 
Mono sodium glutamate 
But stood for 
Mom stayed grinding 
And also when it comes down to us 
it stands for 
She made us something great 
And finally it stood for 
My souls gratification 
So this is an ode to you
Presented in a bowl like needles in a compass 
Which was seasoned by the seasons 
You spent encompassed by the struggles of us 
So take this hot soup as homage 
Thanks mom, my childhood was delicious 
**The 1ac is as empty and absent as my household without a father, trying to appeal to something that just doesn’t exist, wishing for a super hero to come even though we know that nothing can ever happen as result of the affirmative plan. Our alternative is the realization, and voting negative is the realization that we must look at the things that are much closer to us. This is no longer a debate about foreign military issues, but this is a debate about what their discussion of foreign military issues can do for people like me, for people who spend every day of their lives worried not about what’s going on in some other country that we have no control over but instead are concerned about what is going on around the corner? Someone who doesn’t have the ability to be concerned by the threat of some impact that the 1ac talks about but instead, they are worried about the threat of not having food to eat at night.** 

Our appeal to the concept of //structural violence// forces attention to everyday instances of oppression that render life manageable. Calling attention to structural violence fosters critical engagement & illuminates interconnections of oppression often taken for granted. Voting affirmative would be to passively accept systemic inequality.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">http://depts.washington.edu/ctcenter/taylor.shtml, “Explaining Difference: “Culture,” “Structural Violence,” and Medical Anthropology,” ACC. 11-8-10, JT</span>
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">“Structure” sounds like a neutral term – it sounds like something that is just there, unquestionable, part of the way the world is. By juxtaposing this with </span><span class="underline">the</span> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">word “violence,” however, Farmer’s</span> <span class="underline">concept of “structural violence” forces our attention to the forms of suffering and injustice that are deeply embedded in the ordinary, taken-for-granted patterns of the way the world is. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">From this follow some important and very challenging insights. First, </span><span class="underline">the same “structures” that render life predictable, secure, comfortable and pleasant for some of us, also mar the lives of others through poverty, insecurity, ill-health and violence</span>. <span style="font-size: 9pt;">Second,</span> <span class="underline">these structures are neither natural nor neutral, but are instead the outcome of long histories of political, economic, and social struggle</span>. <span style="font-size: 9pt;">Third,</span> <span class="underline">being nothing more</span> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">(and nothing less!)</span> <span class="underline">than patterns of collective social action, these structures can and should be changed. “Structural violence” thus encourages us to look for differences within large-scale social structures – differences of power, wealth, privilege and health that are unjust and unacceptable</span>. <span style="font-size: 9pt;">By the same token</span>, <span class="underline">“structural violence” encourages us to look for connections between what might be falsely perceived separate and distinct social worlds. “Structural violence” also encourages an attitude of moral outrage and critical engagement, in situations where the automatic response might be to passively accept systematic inequalities.</span>
