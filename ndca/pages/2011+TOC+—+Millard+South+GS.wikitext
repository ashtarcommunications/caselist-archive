Snelling:

<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">If you are few </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">And have no B-52s “</span>
Gonzaba:

<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">You that hide behind walls</span>**</span>
You that hide behind desks
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">I just want you to know</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">I can see through your masks</span>**”</span>
Snelling:
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">“If you are not a head of state</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">With an army and police</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1; tab-stops: 191.15pt;">If you have neither napalm</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Nor tanks</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Nor electronic battlefields</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Terror is if you are dispossessed</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">And have only your own two hands </span>
Each other
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;"><span class="ReadingTextChar">And your rage</span>”</span>
Gonzaba: 
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">“**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">You that never done nothin'</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">But build to destroy</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">You play with my world</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Like it's your little toy</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">You put a gun in my hand</span>**</span>
And you hide from my eyes
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">And you turn and run farther</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">When the fast bullets fly</span>**”</span>
Snelling: 
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">“It is not terror</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">If you are New York’s Finest</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">And you shoot a ten-year old black child in the back</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Because you think Black people</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">All look like </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;"><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">They’ve just committed a robbery IT is not terror if you are ITT</span></span></span>
And buy the men
Who line Chilean doctors up in their hospital corridors 
And shoot them for supporting the late 
Democratic government of their country
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">It is not terror but heroism</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">If you were captured by the Vietnamese</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">For dropping fragmentation bombs</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">On their schools and hospitals</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Only those who have nothing </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Can be terrorists” </span>

<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">You lie and deceive</span>**</span>
A world war can be won
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">You want me to believe</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">But I see through your eyes</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">And I see through your brain</span>**</span>
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain” 
Snelling:
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">“Brothers and sisters, let us choose</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Our weapons carefully and humanely </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Let us use no torture</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Or napalm</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Or genocide” </span>
Gonzaba: 
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">“**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">You fasten the triggers</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">For the others to fire</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Then you set back and watch</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">When the death count gets higher</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">You hide in your mansion</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">As young people's blood</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Flows out of their bodies</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">And is buried in the mud</span>**”</span>
Snelling: 
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">“But do not be fooled </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">There is no weapon they will allow</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Nothing that works will be called legitimate </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Unless we fight for it </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Unless we educate ourselves and others </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Unless we separate resistance from oppression” </span>
Gonzaba:
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">“ **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">You've thrown the worst fear</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">That can ever be hurled</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Fear to bring children</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Into the world</span>**</span>
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins”
<span style="tab-stops: 220.0pt;">Snelling: </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">“The same editorials that scream terrorism</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Screamed mob rule </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">At the civil-rights marches of the early sixties</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">At the war-demonstrations”</span>
Gonzaba: 
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">“**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">How much do I know</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">To talk out of turn</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">You might say that I'm young</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">You might say I'm unlearned</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">But there's one thing I know</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Though I'm younger than you</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Even Jesus would never</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Forgive what you do</span>**”</span>
Snelling: 
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">“Thousands of busted heads later</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">They say of course </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">We always upheld the right to peaceful protest</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Sisters and brothers, think hard before you jump</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Onto the bandwagon</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Of condemning terrorism </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Remember who is making the definitions </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Remember not to strengthen the hand</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">That will turn in an instant</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Against every means of resistance to oppression </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">That bandwagon rolls straight toward fascism</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Do not forget the real terrorists </span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">That lurk behind the masks of heads of state</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;"><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Do not be afraid to</span></span> hold strong together</span>

<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Is your money that good</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Will it buy you forgiveness</span>**</span>
Do you think that it could
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">I think you will find</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">When your death takes its toll</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">All the money you made</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Will never buy back your soul</span>**</span>

<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">And I hope that you die</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">And your death'll come soon</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">I will follow your casket</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">In the pale afternoon</span>**</span>
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">And I'll watch while you're lowered</span>**</span>

<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">And I'll stand o'er your grave</span>**</span>

</span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">We are demanding that the pentacle of power once again be used to serve the interests of GOD manifest in the world as man.

If we have a demand,</span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> it is simply and emphatically that they, along with their fellow inmates in the Republican Party, cease to exist. </span></span><span class="ReadingTextChar"> We demand a society </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">built along the alternative community in Lincoln Park, a society based on humanitarian cooperation and equality, a society</span></span><span class="ReadingTextChar"> which allows and promotes the creativity present in all people and especially </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">our</span></span><span class="ReadingTextChar"> youth. </span>

So here we go:
We think the debate community needs to continue to be a place that discusses the disenfranchisement of minority voices. we envision a place for those excluded from hyper-technical debate discourse.
We think debate should be an open space of intellectual engagement for all types of intellects. We must be willing to accept their methods for political change.
We think that when you walk into a debate round you should debate as yourself… debate is one of the most awesome things about life…we should not participate like puppets. We demand that debate becomes FREE.

<span class="TagChar">We Start with a Prayer for Peace from Lao-Tse </span>(Taoist), Found at [[http://www.uuwestport.org/Readings/prayer4peace.html]]
<span style="color: black; font-family: Helvetica;">
</span>If there is to be peace in the world,
There must be peace in the nations.
If there is to be peace in the nations,
There must be peace in the cities.
If there is to be peace in the cities,
There must be peace between neighbors.
If there is to be peace between neighbors,
There must be peace in the home.
If there is to be peace in the home,
There must be peace in the heart. 
If there is to be peace in the heart,
There must be peace in the home. 
If there is to be peace in the home,
There must be peace in between neighbors.
If there is to be peace between neighbors,
There must be peace in the cities.
If there is to be peace in the cities,
There must be peace in the nations.
If there is to be peace in the nations,
There must be peace in the world.
We are here at the TOC for the cause of peace. Lao-Tse reminds us that if we are going to be agents of peace we must begin the advocacy for peace at the level of our lives. In this sense our protest is an opportunity for us to make debate a link in a chain of peace. 
“When the president talks to god” by Bright Eyes, Lyrics found at: http://www.plyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/whenthepresidenttalkstogod.html
“When the president talks to God
Are the conversations brief or long?
Does he ask to rape our women’s rights
And send poor farm kids off to die?
Does God suggest an oil hike
When the president talks to God?

When the president talks to God
Are the consonants all hard or soft?
Is he resolute all down the line?
Is every issue black or white?
Does what God say ever change his mind
When the president talks to God?”


the political system as constructed ignores the voices of oppressed people in order to pay service to their financial taskmasters. Mumia Abu-Jamal indicates that
<span class="cite0"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mumia Abu-Jamal in 08</span></span> (Changeless Change: The Law of Politics. Transcriped from radio essay available online http://www.prisonradio.org/mumia.htm [col. writ. 4/5/08] (c)) 
True change doesn't come through the ballot box -- even though we're all taught that it does. For voting was instituted to insure stability, not change. I know this may seem somewhat sacrilegious to many entranced during this current political season, for it certainly looks like change. But if we look deeper, we see how the very process itself -- the campaign -- is an exercise in conformity. People come to political campaigns to reassure themselves that their politicians won't bring too much change. In essence, our political campaigns are little more than slick popularity contests: who looks best? Who makes me feel most comfortable? Who would I like to have a brew with? John Kerry lost in 2004 not only because large parts of Ohio were stolen, nor that he was successfully swift-boated by lies about his tour in Vietnam; he lost because his opponents launched a stealth campaign against him branding him as an intellectual, an egghead with advanced degrees who even spoke French! Americans, especially in this age of anti-intellectualism, aren't comfortable with eggheads. So, they comfortably 'elected' a blockhead. Therein lies the current contrast between Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton -- not race nor gender -- but popularity. At bottom, our politics is 95% beauty contest. On issues, the two are almost inseparable. And truth be told (despite right wing propaganda to the contrary) neither are actually liberals; both are neo liberals, who are, at heart, globalists of the NAFTA type. Neither wants to repeal NAFTA -- they want to "re-negotiate" it (not really surprising considering that both are also lawyers.). They are vying for who will become Chief Manager of the Empire, after the Bush wrecking crew is done. Neither are anti-imperialists -- they just want better, smarter management of it; empire, with a smile. (John McCain promises he won't smile) How could it be otherwise with the almost obscene amounts of money in play? How could it be other than this with the hundreds of millions of dollars that have sloshed through all of the presidential campaigns, most of it for media ad buys? That doesn't mean that people aren't interested, or even desperate for change. But what kind of change will they get? When's the last time you've heard any presidential candidate mention the words imperialism, poor people, or -- heavens forfend! -- capitalism? If they mention capitalism, it's almost like a religion that needs defending -- for no "viable" candidate criticizes capitalism. For, like a religion, it must be believed in. Just like politicians are believed in, until they inevitably betray those who voted for them. Who do you think they ultimately owe their loyalty to; those who voted for them? Or those who gave them millions of dollars to run? --(c) '08 maj 

“ When the president talks to God
Does he fake that drawl or merely nod?
Agree which convicts should be killed?
Where prisons should be built and filled?
Which voter fraud must be concealed
When the president talks to God?

When the president talks to God
I wonder which one plays the better cop
We should find some jobs. the ghetto's broke
No, they're lazy, George, I say we don't
Just give 'em more liquor stores and dirty coke
That's what God recommends”
The Problem is Civil Obedience: Transcript of a Speech Delivered by Howard Zinn at a peace rally on Boston Common on May 5, 1971
<span class="ReadingTextChar">A lot of people are troubled by civil disobedience</span>. As soon as you talk about committing civil disobedience <span class="ReadingTextChar">they get a little upset. But that's exactly the purpose of civil disobedience</span>, to upset people, to trouble them, to disturb them. We who commit civil disobedience are disturbed to and we need to disturb those who are in charge of the war, because the president, by his lies, is trying to create an air of calm and tranquility in people's minds when there is no calm and tranquility in Southeast Asia, and we mustn't let people forget that. And those people who get troubled and excited about civil disobedience have got to have some sense of proportion. <span class="ReadingTextChar">The people who commit civil disobedience are engaging in the most petty of disorders in order to protest against mass murder</span>. These people are violating the most petty of laws, trespass laws and traffic laws, in <span class="ReadingTextChar">order to protest against the government's violation of the most holy of laws, "tho shalt not kill".</span> And, <span class="ReadingTextChar">these people who commit civil disobedience don't do harm to any person. They protest the violence of government</span>. We need to do something to disturb that calm, smiling, murderous president in the White House. Now they say we disturb even our friends when we commit civil disobedience, and that's true. But the history of civil disobedience in this country and in other parts of the world shows that people may at first sight be put off by civil disobedience, but at second sight, at second thought, they learn that the protesters against war are right, and after a while they join us in their own way, and that's why we must carry on. The Congressmen, you see this in the newspapers, <span class="ReadingTextChar">while seven thousand people are arrested in Washington, you see Congressmen coming out in the headlines saying, "Oh, that's bad. You're upsetting those of us in Congress who have worked so hard. You're rocking and so on and so forth." Well, we need to upset Congress. We need to disturb Congress, because for six years the President has carried on an unconstitutional war, and for six years the bodies of Americans have been coming home in plastic bags, and for six years the villages and countryside of Vietnam have been destroyed, and these members of Congress have been sitting there silently, passively, voting the money for this war.</span> And if these Congressmen don't like the upsets to courtesy and decorum represented by civil disobedience, then let them courteously, separately, put an end to the murder in Vietnam by stopping the funds for the war, or by filibustering or impeaching the President and the Vice President and impeaching every high official in government. Let them not criticize those who in anguish cry out with the only means we have left with our energies, with our spirits, with our bodies, against the abomination of this war. It's been a long time since we impeached a president. And it's time, time to impeach a President, and the Vice President, and everybody else sitting in high office who carries on this war<span class="ReadingTextChar">. The Constitution says, Article 2 Section 4, that the President and the Vice President, and other civil officers of the government may be impeached for, and I quote, ""High crimes and misdemeanors". Is not making war on the peasants</span> of Southeast Asia <span class="ReadingTextChar">a high crime</span>? 
Thus we will engage in our alternative in this debate … in this round … Let us be explicit – we are protesting the state that they authorize to control agency. To determine behavior…

Do exorcise and cast out the EVIL which has walled and captured the pentacle of power and perverted its use to the need of the total machine and its child the hydrogen bomb and has suffered the people of the planet earth, the American people and creatures of the mountains, wood, streams, and oceans grievous mental and physical torture and the constant torment of the imminent threat of UTTER DESTRUCTION

“When the president talks to God
Do they drink near beer and go play golf
While they pick which countries to invade
Which Muslim souls still can be saved?
I guess god just calls a spade a spade
When the president talks to God

When the president talks to God
Does he ever think that maybe he's not?
That that voice is just inside his head
When he kneels next to the presidential bed
Does he ever smell his own bullshit
When the president talks to God?

I doubt it, I doubt it”
