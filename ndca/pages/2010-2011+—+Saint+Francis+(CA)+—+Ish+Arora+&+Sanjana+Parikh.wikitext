<span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Georgia; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal;">I thought I should know what the women were doing. I did it myself for two days. If there were ten guys, I’d have to take in ten. If a hundred men, then a hundred times. In general, you can do about twenty men. I’d take a drinking table and drink with them. Then we’d go into another room and make love. After we finished, wed leave quickly so another couple could go in. Then I’d come out and try to direct the traffic. They also had a show. As they went up to the table, there would be cucumbers, eggs, paintbrushes, and so on. The women would do a show and then make love right after that. The owners wanted me to hurry the women along – make up their faces again to sit down in the window and receive the next customers. If they didn’t sit in the window, the customers wouldn’t come in. But so many customers – it just isn’t something human being should do. It was like they were lying there with their legs apart. The women were getting tired. So I’d tell them to rest a little. It was driving me crazy. Some of the customers would mistreat the women. What surprised me was the fact that these women had to endure this money. I felt as though I hadn’t suffered anything in comparison to them. Yet they stayed because they money was good. I guess there are worse places. One day, I just gave up. Only a few people with the stomach for it could work there. I couldn’t stand it any longer. These were my sisters living like this. I’m willing to work hard, but I just couldn’t bring myself to force these women who were so tired to receive another customer. I slept in bed all day. The owner came and asked me, “You really cant do it?” I said, “I cant. These women aren’t animals. Theyre human beings.” He said he would bring me the money I’d earned. They didn’t want me to let the secret out. I said thanks and left. I couldn’t believe there were places like that. No matter how good the money is, I felt I couldn’t work like that.” </span>
