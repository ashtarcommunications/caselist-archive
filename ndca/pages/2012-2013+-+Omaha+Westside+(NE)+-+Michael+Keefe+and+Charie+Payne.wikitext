=<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0000ff;">The Grapes of Wrath Affirmative Version 1</span>= 
=Grapes of Wrath= 
**“And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about.” – John Steinbeck**

**Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? My mother says the nuns taught us that there were two ways through life –the way of nature, and the way of grace. You must choose which one you will follow. She says,**

**“Grace doesn’t try to please itself. Accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked. Accepts insults and injuries. Nature only wants to please itself. To have its own way. It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things.”**

**I told her, when I was young**

**“I will be true to you. Whatever comes.”**

<span class="Underline">**But that was when I was young, when I could speak truths and mean them, before I ever learned my lessons. And now, as I stand here in front of you, on the verge of adulthood, I can tell you that I have been weathered by nature and its unforgiving agendas, robbed of my own grace through life’s endless lessons. Lessons that once hung over my eyes, enshrouding even the most radical reaches of my mind in the shadows, shielding me from the light of my own creativity. Lessons that brought about choking darkness over the endless roads of my mind. Lessons constructed out of the very discourse and memories of my educators. Whose bloodlines date back to the very beginning, when the foundations of the Earth were laid and when all the sons of God shouted for joy. Where someone somewhere made the first decision, the one to rule all others. The one that paved the highways to happiness and identity. The very decision that is made every year a debate resolution is written, and that is what we remember about each resolution, that we have all already decided what the resolution is, and what it is not. This globalizing identity has put debate on an island, leaving us we all spout off our archaic lessons at each other, while the self-dubbed Gods of debate, the framers bask in the glory of their all-powerful decision.**</span>

<span class="Underline">**Debate, like us, had grace. It never tried to please itself. However, the constant policing of knowledge and the fetish over the idea that there is only one way to win in debate has robbed debate of its creative and real political potential. Whether it’s life as a whole, or our more simply, our lives in the debate community, the fact that we allow the original thinkers of life and debate to rule over our own thoughts with their endless lessons is blinding us to the reality that we all still have grace inside of us. That there are endless lines of flight that we can take to break the oppressive rulebook labeled human/debate nature. This ideal is reflected in John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath. We feel that through a critical re-reading of The Grapes of Wrath we can create a space to bring the education that has marginalized by the status quo of debate.** </span>
<span class="Underline">**Speaking of the status quo of debate, we begin our re-reading in chapter 3, the turtle.** </span>

<span class="Underline">**“**</span><span style="color: black;">**His horny beak was partly open, and his fierce, humorous eyes, under brows like fingernails, stared straight ahead. He came over the grass leaving a beaten trail behind him, and the hill, which was the highway embankment, reared up ahead of him. For a moment he stopped, his head held high. He blinked and looked up and down. At last he started to climb the embankment. Front clawed feet reached forward but did not touch. The hind feet kicked his shell along, and it scraped on the grass, and on the gravel. As the embankment grew steeper and steeper, the more frantic were the efforts of the land turtle. Pushing hind legs strained and slipped, boosting the shell along, and the horny head protruded as far as the neck could stretch.” (15).** </span>

<span style="color: black;">**The turtle represents society. The body is made up of all kinds of different body parts, all seeming to have a different motive. The turtle’s hind legs push and strain to climb the embankment of the highway, tearing grass out of its roots and sending gravel flying in the hind legs’ struggle. Its front claws grasp for life. While all the while the head of the turtle darts around endlessly, policing the rest of the body parts, forcing them to go out of their physical capabilities to climb the highway. Think of each body part, having its own identity, representing the multiple facets of society. Hey all contain their own wants and desires but are denied their right to address their own creativity and grace by the head, which darts around endlessly, unwilling to understand that multiple identities do exist within itself. Who asserts its dogmas upon the rest of the body, telling it to lose all value in its existence in the quest of a higher efficiency of physical transportation.** </span>


<span style="color: black; display: block; text-align: justify;">**These hierarchies of identity exist in the debate space now. A set of rules were created by the original thinkers of debate to teach us lessons about what affs to run, what knowledge is good, what body parts to fetish above the others, rendering us all blind to any alternatives. When in actuality, it is an endless jumble of words thrown together by these educators reading Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States.** </span>


<span style="color: black; display: block; text-align: justify;">**Now to highlight the impact of the status quo. In chapter 5, Steinbeck highlights how the policing of education robs debate of its grace through the mentality that one straight line of thought, or the idea that debate and life can only be done correctly one way. He does this through his use of the tractor.** </span>


<span style="color: black; display: block; text-align: justify;">**“Snubnosed monsters, raising the dust and sticking their snouts into it, straight down the country, across the country, through fences, through dooryards, in and out of gullies in straight lines. They did not run on the ground, but on their own roadbeds. They ignored hills and gulches, water courses, fences, houses.** </span>
<span style="color: black;">**The man sitting in the iron seat did not look like a man; gloved, goggled, rubber dust mask over nose and mouth, he was a part of the monster, a robot in the seat. The thunder of the cylinders sounded through the country, became one with the air and the earth, so that earth and air muttered in sympathetic vibration. The driver could not control it—straight across country it went, cutting through a dozen farms and straight back… Behind the tractor rolled the shining disks, cutting the earth with blades—not plowing but surgery. Behind the harrows, the long seeders—twelve curved iron penes erected in the foundry, orgasms set by gears. The driver sat in his iron seat and he was proud.”** </span>
<span style="color: black;">**As a human race and as participants in the debate space we together have created a fetish over this straightness. We let the boundaries it creates mask over our identities and grace destroying any possibility for creativity in the debate space.**</span>

<span style="color: black;">**However, we can break away from the dogmatisms of the status quo through an affirmation of the nomadic journey of Tom Joad. Joad represents the break through with his willingness to not only seize the day, but in his willingness to simply not comply with the morals humanity had constructed to quiet his creativity. He functionally rebirths himself, and** </span>**when this Tom Joad appears, he becomes representative walking man, the individual who must accept responsibility for what man has done to himself, debate and to the earth. Along with Tom, the Joads and all of the other debaters will be sent on the road on a quest to rethink their relationship with humanity as well as with the land itself.****This is what your ballot affirms.**

**"I'll be all around in the dark. I'll be ever'-where - wherever you can look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad - I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise, and livin' in the houses they build - I'll be there, too."****The journey of Tom Joad acts as a natural virus created through knowledge production and every day decision making that rejects society’s global ethics and spits out a new code of ethics in return. Only then can each person truly find himself or herself and have create their own unique place in society to use their individuality to reach for infinity.**

**We today live in a society where we are forced to accept that identity should have been checked at that door (point to door). The turtle paradox is still the reality of today as we justify the destruction of humanity through reluctance to understand what the turtle truly represents, an argument against itself. //The Grapes of Wrath//** **has offered the remedy to this situation; we only need to reorient what makes humanity so beautiful.**

=<span style="color: #0000ff;">THE Moloch Kritik</span>= 
The beat has died.
The Howl has lied.
The Moloch deletes.
The Moloch repeats.
We stand here on the bones of the last dead generation
The act of uniform defecation upon their graves
The Infants playing in their shit, a society enslaved
The debate about saving lives that have already been lost.
The Affirmative team pulls out the wallet, everything is so perfect.
The Licking of chops,
The Endless Chanting,
The heartless romancing,
WHAT IS THE COST?

The director, Fritz Lang poured the laborers into the Moloch’s jaws
The act of defining what being human means in a capitalistic court of law
The billion sacrifices to feed the beast’s hunger
The Moloch retreats back, hiding his true form, into fateful slumber
The elite of metropolis live in luxurious ignorance
While the dehumanized mass work and live in hell
The affirmative, like the thinkers of metropolis, use beautiful imagery describing the situation at hand
Then trick you into saving it with their diabolical plan
The leading of you into the belly of the beast
The more meat for the grinder, the more for capitalism to feast.

(Moloch scene from Metropolis)

The poet Allen Ginsberg laid down the beat to tap your feet to
The pointless Howling to the world of its lost generation
The urban legends that Ginsberg describes
The Angel Headed Hipsters who have come forth to die
The lines of the damned march into Moloch’s fangs
The removal of the thought completely brings the Moloch no pain

The eerie thing is, ladies and gentlemen The decades have wielded no change,
The leaders of the free world issue a decree for praise
The reason for happiness? Of course that we have attained capital
WHAT ELSE IS NEEDED AS LONG AS YOU HAVE MONEY
DOING IS EASY AS LONG AS WE FIAT
The affirmative strokes our hair, smiling, calling us honey

The experts say Earth is a dog eat dog kind of planet, the aff can attest
The only home worth protecting is littered with bones wrapped in dollar bills
The shit of Moloch separates the privileged from the pests
Even Pop Culture is infected with this illuminati curse
The media likens the word with rock star with stupid bitch with a purse
The often-left messages by those with pop culture ties
The Corruption by fashion magazines, simply labeling it the season’s hot new item on the rise

The pop icon, Maria of Metropolis
The preacher turned sex android
The protagonist turned antagonist
The mighty Moloch is hard to avoid
The flash of her left eye
The modified shit-eating grin, well supplied
The readiness of Moloch to rear his terrible face
The dog eat dog ideology sprouts into its place
The copycat pop icon Lady Gaga covers her left eye
More than a gimmick for any heartsick guy
The Howl of a beloved rings in our ears again

But rather than heed the word of a savior, society takes Moloch’s place
One after one, they cover their left eye
Jessie J, Nicki Minaj the list never dies
The Moloch swallows another idol in disguise

The modified whore sent to play the role of Babylon
For any schmuck with a brain, a job and a hard-on
Moloch deletes
Moloch repeats
The pop culture icon Madonna creates a catchy 80’s song
The absence of Moloch in a pests’ life, makes you want to sing a long
Again Moloch’s vision comes to fruition
The men reach for her, like she is a possession
The same whore of Babylon is what the media assigns
The beloved sinks back to her side, defeated, and begins to cry

The Moloch turns over in his sleep
The Society seems to be fine without him; he dares them to go to space
The Howl arises as if on cue, too late
The plan has passed,
The body counts have prevailed
The Moloch Shit covers the world
<span style="font-size: 72pt;">NOOOOOOOOOOOO!</span>
(Close Computer)

The Moloch has sealed our fate
At least the bones wrapped in capital looks nice from space
The Moloch sits back, smiling in wait
The plan was a great success
His belly is full of the last dead generation
The Moloch deletes
The Moloch repeats

<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!</span>



<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"> Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!</span>



<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"> Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the stunned governments!</span>



<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"> Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! </span>

<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"> Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovas! Moloch whose factories dream and choke in the fog! Moloch whose smokestacks and antennae crown the cities!</span>



<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"> Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose name is the Mind!</span>



<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"> Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream angels! Crazy in Moloch! Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!</span>



<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"> Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!</span>



<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"> Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisable suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!</span>



<span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"> They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!</span>

**The scream is exactly what allows us to realize what capitalism is and the crisis that Moloch represents. The extreme of emotion brought out in policy debate is a recipe for disaster for Moloch and his capitalistic hold on society. The scream sensitizes you out of the comfortably numb mentality to identify that capitalism is indeed the a priori crisis in this debate round. Capitalism is a system that is so anti-human that only an anti-human response can combat it. Once you hear the scream you begin your road to joy and freedom. You bash down the fourth wall between me as a debater and you as a judge, exposing Moloch for what he is, the piercing scream shatters his toothy smile.**
**John Holloway, 2002**, <span style="font-size: 6pt;">“Change The Word Without Taking Power”, [[http://libcom.org/library/change-world-without-taking-power-john-holloway]] Ph.D in Political Science from University of Edinburgh</span>

**__If crisis expresses the extreme disarticulation of social relations, then revolution must be understood as the intensification of crisis.__**
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This implies a rejection of two distinct understandings of crisis. Firstly, it rejects the traditional concept of the crisis as an opportunity for revolution. This is a concept shared by Marxists of many different perspectives. The argument is that</span> **__when the big crisis of capitalism comes, this will be the moment in which revolution becomes possible: economic crisis will lead to an intensification of class struggle, and this, if guided by effective revolutionary organisation, can lead to revolution.__****__This approach understands__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">crisis as economic crisis, as something distinct from class struggle, rather than as being itself class struggle, a turning point in class struggle,</span> **__the point at which the mutual repulsion of capital and__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">anti-labour</span> (**__humanity__**) **__obliges capital to restructure its command or lose control.__**
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Secondly, this approach rejects the view that the crisis of capital can be equated with its restructuring. This view sees crisis as being functional for capital, a ‘creative destruction’ (to use Schumpeter’s phrase) which destroys inefficient capitals and imposes discipline on the workers. The crisis of one economic model or paradigm of rule leads automatically, in this view, to the establishment of a new one. The argument here is that a crisis is essentially open. Crisis may indeed lead to a restructuring of capital and to the establishment of a new pattern of rule, but it may not.</span> **__To identify crisis with restructuring is to close the possibility of the world, to rule out the definitive rupture of capital. To identify crisis with restructuring is also to be blind to the whole world of struggle that capital’s transition from its crisis to its restructuring has always involved.__**
**__Crisis is,__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">rather,</span> **__the falling apart of the social relations of capitalism.__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It can never be assumed in advance that capital will succeed in recomposing them. Crisis involves a salto mortale for capital, with no guarantee of a safe landing.</span> **__Our struggle is against capital’s restructuring, our struggle is to intensify the disintegration of capitalism. The moving force of crisis is the drive for freedom__**, <span style="font-size: 6pt;">the reciprocal flight of capital of capital and anti-labour,</span> **__the mutual repulsion of capital and humanity. The first moment of revolution is purely negative.__**
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">On the side of capital, the drive for freedom involves the spewing out of nauseating workers, the insatiable pursuit of the alchemist’s dream of making money from money, the endlessly restless violence of credit and debt.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">On the side of anti-capital, flight is in the first place negative, the refusal of domination, the destruction and sabotage of the instruments of domination (machinery, for instance), a running away from domination, nomadism, exodus, desertion. People have a million ways of saying No. The driving force is not so much insubordination, the overt and militant refusal of capital, as non-subordination, the less perceptible and more confused reluctance to conform. Often the No is expressed so personally (dying one’s hair green, committing suicide, going mad) that it appears to be incapable of having any political resonance. Often the No is violent or barbaric (vandalism, hooliganism, terrorism):</span> **__the depradations of capitalism are so intense that they provoke a scream-against, a No which is almost completely devoid of emancipatory potential, a No so bare that it merely reproduces that which is screamed against.__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The current development of</span> **__capitalism is__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">so terroristic that it provokes a terroristic response,</span> **__so anti-human that it provokes an equally anti-human response__**, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">which, although quite comprehensible, merely reproduces the relations of power which it seeks to destroy. And yet</span> **__that is the starting point: not the considered rejection of capitalism as a mode of organisation, not the militant construction of alternatives to capitalism.__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">They come later (or may do).</span> **__The starting point is the scream, the dangerous, often barbaric No.__**

**This is a movement that does not have an ending. It is a definition that negates itself in the same breath. It is a question,****an invitation to discuss.**
**This is an alternative that does not have a happy ending. Nothing in this speech has changed the horrors of the society in**  **which we live. How many children have died needlessly since I started to write it? How many since you began to**  **hear it? If the speech has done anything to weaken or dull the scream or to conceptualise it out of existence, it has****failed. The aim has been to strengthen it, to make it more strident. The scream continues.**
**This is a movement that does not (yet?) have a happy**
