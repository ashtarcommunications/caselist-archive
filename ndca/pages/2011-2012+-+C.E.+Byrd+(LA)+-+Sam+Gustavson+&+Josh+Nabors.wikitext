**<span style="font-size: 16px;">The affirmatives fixation with events outside of our control contributes to a culture of guilt feeding which turns life against itself. Your death is inevitable and the actions of a federal government you have no agency over will not save you. The alternative to the 1ACs approach to politics is to affirm a rhizomatic politics which invigorates personal agency.</span>**

===Nietzsche=== 
**All life is a piece of fate, a collection of becomings, wills, forces that make up the whole. Moralism relies on the fiction of free will that is used to make individuals accountable for their present condition, denying the innocence of becoming by making us guilty for ourselves. However, to judge guilty a part of life is to judge all of it, damning life itself.**
**__Nietzsche__**, Anti-Christ and really smart German dude, **__1889__** [Friedrich, //Twighlight of the Idols//]

**The affirmative is premised on the desire to abolish all of the excesses of life. They assume that that which is Good is that which causes the least pain, which caters to the weak and protects them from the strong. However, this logic denies life, making it something to be abolished.**
**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 16px;">Nietzsche</span>__**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 16px;">, Anti-Christ and really smart German dude, **__1886__** [Friedrich, //Beyond Good and Evil//]</span>


**Moralism denies us the ability to affirm ourselves or life. Moralism relies on the fiction of a neutral subject capable of either manifesting strength or holding back, ignoring the fact that that which is strong is that which manifests itself and that which is weak is that which does not. The Evil are those that exhibit the most strength, that hold back nothing and embrace fully all the becomings of life, the Good are those that exhibit the least strength, those that hold back everything and would have life remain exactly as it is.**

**__<span style="font-size: 16px;">Deleuze</span>__**<span style="font-size: 16px;">, Nomadologist and really smart French dude, **__1962__** [Gilles, //Nietzsche and Philosophy//]</span>



**Moralism establishes violent hierarchies within society. We are denied the ability to assert ourselves as Good by the powerful fiction of Evil. All deemed different and Other is cast out, demonized and destroyed violently. We torment ourselves for failing to be properly socialized and relinquish every last bit of freedom we possess to conform to the Good.**

**<span style="font-size: 16px;">Bromley</span>**<span style="font-size: 16px;">, random Nietzsche person, **1994** [Roger, //THE PEDAGOGICS OF RESSENTIMENT : The Experience of// Hamlet, </span>[[http://www.hil.no/biblioteket/Publikasjoner/Hamlet/H-Foreword.html]]<span style="font-size: 16px;">]</span>



**Life is an art, its only value is aesthetic. Life, in all its excess, is beautiful. The only life worth living is a reckless, amoral, joyous one. Moralism denies the beauty of life by attempting to abolish all of its excesses. Life is intrinsically amoral, thus, the desire to abolish excess and confine it within moral boundaries is both futile and the worst, most dangerous of errors. Life no longer has any meaning and becomes something to be abolished. The unbearable pain that life itself now causes us is the only true form of suffering. No matter what they change, no matter what action they take, life still remain something Evil, to be destroyed and cast into the abyss. The backdrop may change, but the existential pain of their nihilistic approach to life remains as a splinter in our minds, destroying us from this inside out.**
**__Nietzsche__**, Anti-Christ and really smart German dude, **__1872__** [Friedrich, //The Birth Of Tragedy//]


**Thus The Alternative: Vote to affirm all of their impacts We deny life in their name, we act to bring about their existence and cage life within their bounds. However, affirmation brings about new values, unknowable values, values that are created by affirmation, not adhered to or strived towards. These values know no boundaries; they come into being through action itself. This round is about ethics, not policy, not action, not advocacy. We ask for your ballot as an endorsement of our ethical stance, not to bring about a utopian Beyond, but because our request is good in itself. Because our very act of debating and the action it entails is active and creative. Vote negative as an act of joyous destruction. Vote as an affirmation of their impacts, as an affirmation of the beauty of life, even that which causes us pain, vote to burn their morals to ash and baptize the Overman in them. All suffering is transmuted into joy, all that is heavy becomes light and our spirits become free. We return with the dawn to live a new day.**
