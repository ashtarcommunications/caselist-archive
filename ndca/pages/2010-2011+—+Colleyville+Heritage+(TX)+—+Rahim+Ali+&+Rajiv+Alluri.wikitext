A global norm prohibiting nuclear weapons testing is a light of hope that will help bring us out of the shadow of adversity and aggression. It will advance a cooperative security regime upon which our mutual survival, indeed the survival of the planet, depends. Just as the global recession has rendered the interdependence of our economies as conventional wisdom, so too must we realize the interdependence of our security, and build a network of global norms and laws that are non-discriminatory and technically-verifiable. It is for this latter reason that the</span></span> <span class="highlight"><span style="color: red; font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal;">CTBT</span></span> <span class="apple-style-span"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal;">is perhaps most important. The treaty is not just an effective arms control and non-proliferation tool. It is, in essence, a game-changer, a way not only by which we will strengthen our collective security, but will actually impel us to cooperate in that collective regim</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">e. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">The IMS is a global, holistic tool that both reinforces and transcends national security interests. It is a global intelligence gatherer which informs all nations, not just with data on nuclear explosions, but on earthquakes, tsunamis and other natural disasters possibly made more frequent by the collective challenge of climate change. 6</span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal;">It constitutes another part, a physical, tangible part, of the web of relationships that engender the cooperation necessary to address the global challenges that threaten the existence of civilization and the living systems upon which it depends.</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10.0pt;">
