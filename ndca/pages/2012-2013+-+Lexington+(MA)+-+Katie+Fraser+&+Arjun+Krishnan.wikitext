<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Barnes 12</span></span> (Julian E. Barnes, Pentagon reporter at the Wall Street Journal, Yuka Hayashi, staff writer for the Wall Street Journal, Wall Street Journal, 4/27/12, “U.S. and Japan Agree on Deal To Move Forces”, [[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303990604577368563724460628.html]] | AK)
<span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The U.S. and Japan reached agreement Thursday on </span><span class="UnderlineChar">a long-stalled plan <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to move</span> troops off the island of Okinawa</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, a key part of the Obama administration's strategy to intensify its focus on Asia, and disperse American troops around the region. The new plan </span><span class="UnderlineChar">would move some 9,000 <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Marines off Okinawa</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, stationing about 5,000 of them on Guam and moving the remainder to Australia or Hawaii, U.S. defense officials said. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">There are now about 18,000 Marines in Okinawa</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Panetta</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> praised the agreement and </span><span class="UnderlineChar">said implementing the agreement <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">would </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">improve the "vital alliance"</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> between the U.S. and Japan</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">"I look forward to deepening that friendship and strengthening our partnership as</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, together, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">we address security challenges in the region</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">," he said. Officials and analysts in Washington said </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the deal would help </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">normalize the security relationship</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"> between the U.S. and Japan</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">allowing the countries to discuss more critical strategic issues</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">—</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">including missile defense and</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">modernization of China's military</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">—</span><span class="UnderlineChar">rather than how to replace the base on Okinawa</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, which is unpopular locally. "I think </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">this is a big deal</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">," </span><span class="UnderlineChar">said</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Andrew </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Hoehn</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, a senior vice president of the RAND Corp., a research institute with close ties to the military. "</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">This has been a </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">major impediment in the</span> U.S.-Japan <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">relationship</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> for many years</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">This was getting in the way of moving ahead</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">." Since 2006, the U.S. and Japan have had a plan to move Marines out of their base at Futenma, and relocate them to another, more rural, part of Okinawa. But the plan has been held up by environmental concerns and local opposition. By presenting </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">concrete plans</span> for reducing U.S. military presence</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, Japanese officials hope the new agreement </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">will ease</span> stubborn <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">local opposition</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Flip-flopping in Tokyo's base policy since the centrist Democratic Party of Japan took power in 2009 has upset residents and officials on the southern island—the host to three-quarters of all U.S. bases in Japan. "</span><span class="UnderlineChar">We wanted to bring forward easing of the burden on Okinawa</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">," Japanese foreign minister Koichiro Gemba told reporters. "</span><span class="UnderlineChar">We were able to come up with a plan that includes return of the land, one that's forward-looking and concrete</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">." The disagreement has already cost the tenure of one prime minister and remains one of the biggest policy headaches for Tokyo. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Under the new agreement, the U.S. will begin returning</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> many of its </span><span class="UnderlineChar">existing facilities in densely-populated areas in</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> the central and southern </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Okinawa</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. But some experts doubt new steps would be enough to solve the logjam. The local city and prefectural assemblies are firmly opposed to the new facility. Hirokazu Nakaima, Okinawa's governor whose support is essential for starting construction, has also insisted the plan won't move forward without consent from the residents. Offers of generous economic development assistance— enough to win over the locals in the past—have done little to change their minds. Weak and unstable leadership in Tokyo is also a concern. Japan has had six prime ministers in the past six years. Under the new agreement, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the U.S. can begin to move Marines to Guam even without a replacement facility for Futenma</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Japan has also pledged to help pay for portions of the Futenma facility</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> until permission is granted to expand the Marines facilities at Camp Schwab. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Japan will</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> also </span><span class="UnderlineChar">pay</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> $3.1 billion of </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> $8.6 billion </span><span class="UnderlineChar">cost of expanding military facilities in Guam and developing training ranges in the waters off the island and in the Northern Mariana Islands</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. That is similar to the $2.8 billion Japan had earlier promised to spend. U.S. defense officials said that they hope Japan will use the training ranges with the U.S., and that the two nations can conduct exercises there. Japan's participation in the training facilities must still be approved by its government. The Obama administration and military officials are in the process of trying to disperse U.S. forces around the Western Pacific, so that the U.S. can respond quickly to different contingences and crisis. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Avoiding concentration of U.S. forces</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and landing facilities also </span><span class="UnderlineChar">avoids vulnerability to a handful of knockout strikes</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. In part, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the new emphasis on Asia is meant to reassure</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> American </span><span class="UnderlineChar">allies in the face of an aggressive Chinese military buildup and North Korean hostility that the U.S. intends to defend their interests and protect the current international order</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span>
And, now is <span class="CiteChar">__critical__ </span>— negotiations are pushing Japan to shoulder a greater share of the realignment cost
<span class="CiteChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Japan Times 12</span></span> (Japan Times, 3/25/12, “Japan asked to shell out extra $1 billion over marines’ transfer to Guam, [[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120325b2.html]])
<span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Washington is pushing Tokyo to pay an additional $1 billion over the transfer</span> of U.S. Marines from Okinawa <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to Guam</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">, </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">reneging</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> on an earlier pledge to shoulder the costs itself</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, sources close to bilateral relations said Saturday. Specifically, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Japan has been asked to cover the</span> equivalent of ¥82 billion in <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">extra costs to construct American military facilities</span> on the U.S. territory</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">despite a bilateral agreement to share the financial burden</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, the sources said. The request was initially made during a recent review of the realignment of American forces in Japan, and comes as the U.S. Congress cranks up the pressure on President Barack Obama to cut federal expenditures. On Friday, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">U.S. officials repeated the request during negotiations</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> with Japanese government representatives in San Francisco, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">but <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Tokyo has been </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">reluctant</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> to agree so far</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Japan</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> instead </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is arguing that its share of the costs should be reduced</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> because the United States announced earlier this month that 3,300 fewer marines will be transferred to Guam, following the realignment review, the sources said. Under a deal reached by the two sides over the marines' relocation, Japan will fund the construction of living facilities for their families, including schools, as well as buildings to house the U.S. military's command center on the Pacific island. The United States, meanwhile, will cover the costs of building military-related facilities, such as those used for training purposes. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Japan's financial contribution</span> over the marines' redeployment to Guam is effectively <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">cap</span>ped at $2.8 billion</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (about ¥230 billion), </span><span class="UnderlineChar">but this amount <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">would be exceeded if it accepts the</span> United States' <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">latest request</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. On the other hand, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Washington's expenses</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, capped at $4.2 billion (around ¥346 billion), </span><span class="UnderlineChar">probably would be reduced</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. In 2006, the two countries agreed to transfer 8,000 marines stationed in Okinawa Prefecture, which hosts the majority of U.S. military facilities in Japan, to Guam. However, the realignment review proposed that this figure be slashed to just 4,700 marines. </span>

The plan __solves__ — the <span class="CiteChar">__perception__</span> of funding sends a strong signal of <span class="CiteChar">__commitment__</span> to the buildup

And </span><span class="UnderlineChar">th<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">e sooner this happens</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the sooner the United States can </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">keep its commitments</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> to Japan</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.” This message resonated well with Okinawa. The main topic of concern by the Japanese reporters was whether the lack of funding or effort would cause a delay in the movement of U.S. troops. The Governor responded frankly that </span><span class="UnderlineChar">with the massive migration to Guam over the past 25 years</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> from the U.S. treaty with the freely associated states, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">infrastructure is</span> already </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">maxed out</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">so how could the island accept another migration without increasing the infrastructure capacity first</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. It is a very practical consideration that Congress must understand. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The buildup is the result of a strengthened Security Treaty </span>between Japan and the U.S</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. In the past few decades, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Okinawa absorbed 75 percent of the impact of U.S. forces in Japan</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The Governor noted that </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the Japanese national government is now recognizing that impact and taking</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> practical </span><span class="UnderlineChar">steps to absorb</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> some of </span><span class="UnderlineChar">that</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> direct </span><span class="UnderlineChar">impact on its air services, roads, and other infrastructure</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The Security Treaty now shifts its focus to Guam</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, which Governor Calvo lauded and supports. He said Guamanians are a patriotic people and welcome the Marines. The Governor told Japanese reporters and the Governor of Okinawa that he is concerned there are some in Congress who do not yet understand that for the buildup to work effectively for the military, practical considerations like the building of capacity for water and wastewater services, roads, and other directly-impacted programs, must be addressed. The Governor expressed hesitation to believe Congress will meet this practical obligation considering Congress’ annual failure for a quarter of a century now to offset the impact of a previous treaty it has entered elsewhere that affects Guam directly – the Compacts of Free Association. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">This is</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> further </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">exacerbated by</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">holdback</span> of a promised $33 million <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">in direct</span> impact <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">funding for Guam</span> in last year’s</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> federal </span><span class="UnderlineChar">budget</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">It was appropriated, but the federal government won’t allow the Department of Defense to spend it without <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">further authorization</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The Governor wrote this concern to the House Armed Services Committee, noting that </span><span class="UnderlineChar">this</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> first appropriation </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">would have sent a </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">strong signal</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> to</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Guam and </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Tokyo that the U.S. government is </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">serious about this commitment</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span>

<span class="UnderlineChar">Many analysts currently detect <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">malaise in Japan about its alliance</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> with the United States. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Some of this relates to</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> North Korea's nuclear weapons and a </span><span class="UnderlineChar">concern that the United States will not adequately represent Japan's interests</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (such as accounting for Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea years ago.) </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Other issues <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">concern the basing of U.S. marines in Okinawa and sharing the costs of moving some to Guam</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The list is long, but they might best be thought of as "housekeeping" issues: many a couple can quarrel over them without contemplating divorce. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">There is</span> a deeper level of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">concern</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, however, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">which relates to Japan's fear of being marginalized</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> as the United States turns toward a rising China. For example, some Japanese complain that China receives far more attention than Japan in the American election campaign. Such anxiety is not surprising: U.S. and Japanese defense capabilities are not symmetrical, and that is bound to agitate the more dependent party. Over the years, various suggestions have been made with a view to making the alliance more symmetrical, including that Japan become a "normal" country with a full panoply of military capabilities, even nuclear weapons. But such measures would raise more problems than they would solve. Even if Japan implemented them, they would still not equal the capacity of the United States or eliminate the asymmetry. It is worth noting that during the Cold War, America's European allies had similar anxieties about dependency and abandonment, despite their own military capabilities. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The real guarantee of</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> American </span><span class="UnderlineChar">resolve to defend Japan is the presence of</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> U.S. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">troops</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and bases, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">and cooperation on issues</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">—such as ballistic missile defense—</span><span class="UnderlineChar">aimed at protecting both Americans and Japanese</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Moreover, there are two good answers to the question of whether the United States would abandon Japan in favor of China: values and threat. Japan and the United States, unlike China, are both democracies, and they share many values. In addition, both Japan and the United States face a common challenge from China's rise and have a strong interest in ensuring that it does not become a threat. The United States regards a triangular Japan-China-U.S. relationship as the basis of stability in East Asia, and wants good relations between all three of its legs. But the triangle is not equilateral, because the United States is allied with Japan, and China need not become a threat to either country if they maintain that alliance. On the other hand, China's power should not be exaggerated. A recent poll indicates that one-third of Americans believe that China will "soon dominate the world," while 54 percent see its emergence as a "threat to world peace." To be sure, measured by official exchange rates, China is the world's fourth largest economy, and it is growing at 10 percent annually. But China's income per capita is only 4 percent that of the United States. If both countries' economies continue to grow at their current rates, China's could be larger than America's in 30 years, but U.S. per capita income will still be four times greater. Furthermore, China lags far behind in military power, and lacks America's "soft power" resources, such as Hollywood and world-class universities. China's internal evolution also remains uncertain. It has lifted 400 million people out of poverty since 1990, but another 400 million live on less that $2 per day. Along with enormous inequality, China has a migrant labor force of 140 million, severe pollution, and rampant corruption. Nor has its political evolution matched its economic progress. While more </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Chinese</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> are free today than ever before in Chinese history, China is far from free. The danger is that Party </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">leaders</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, trying to counter the erosion of communism, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">will turn to nationalism</span> to provide ideological glue, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">which could lead to</span> an unstable foreign policy</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">—</span><span class="UnderlineChar">including</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, for example, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">conflict over Taiwan</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Faced with such uncertainty, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">a wise policy combines realism with liberalism. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">By reinforcing their alliance, the U</span>nited <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and Japan can hedge against uncertainty while</span> at the same time <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">offering China integration into global institutions</span> as a "responsible stakeholder.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">" The greatest danger is that an escalating fear of enmity in the three countries becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. In that sense, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the</span> U.S.-Japan <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">alliance rests on deeply rooted joint interests</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">There is a new dimension to the alliance</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, however, and to the relationship with China. This year, China surpassed the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. China argues, correctly, that it is still behind the United States and Japan in per capita emissions, but this does not reduce the costs imposed on the world (including Japan and the United States). A cooperative program that helps China to burn its coal more cleanly is in the interests of all three countries. In general, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">transnational threats such as climate change or pandemics can cause damage on a scale equivalent to military conflict</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.

Geopolitically, it is like the Bermuda triangle, reversing expected alignments and suspending normal rules of the game. It pits Asia’s two most significant Communist countries, China and Vietnam, against each other, unites usually bitter enemies China and Taiwan, and is drawing the United States back to a partnership with Vietnam a generation after the fall of Saigon. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The South</span> China <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Sea is the flashpoint</span> in the Pacific </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">where conflict is most likely to break out through miscalculation</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar">. It is a crowded maritime environment contested by some inexperienced maritime forces with underdeveloped naval doctrine, among whom <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">there are no</span> established and accepted <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">rules for managing</span> maritime <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">incidents</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. And </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">combination of</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> the claimant states’ </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">power asymmetries</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">overlapping prerogatives</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and</span> growing <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">nationalism mean that incidents</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, once they occur, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are likely to escalate</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. There are four reasons why finding solutions to the South China Sea disputes should be given the highest priority by strategic policy-makers. 1. For China it’s about security – and respect </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The South China Sea symbolises Beijing’s larger maritime dilemma.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> The country’s major population and productive centres cluster along China’s coastline, and are therefore vulnerable to major attack from the sea. Naval strategists see China as hemmed in along its sea coast by a chain of states or territories hostile to Beijing: Japan, Korea, the Ryuku Islands, Taiwan, and the Philippines. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The overriding goal of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Chinese naval strategy is to establish dominance</span> over the waters within this ‘first island chain</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">’. At the southern end of the first island chain, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the</span> South China <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Sea is crucial to China’s commercial shipping</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, energy flows, and the access of its Hainan island-based submarines to the Pacific. But </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the South China Sea’s southern and western access points</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> – the Sunda, Lombok, Luzon and Malacca Straits – </span><span class="UnderlineChar">are controlled by allies or partners of the United States. The best way to offset this vulnerability is to control the South China Sea itself – and thereby loosen the American position in Southeast Asia</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Influential elites in China view the South China Sea as ‘blue territory’ – that is, as much a part of China’s sovereign territory as Tibet, Xinjiang or Taiwan. To this line of thinking, any surrender of its claims in the South China Sea would signal a weakening of its rights to Tibet, Xinjiang or Taiwan – and is therefore unthinkable. China’s 1992 Territorial Law classified the South China Sea as China’s internal waters, meaning foreign naval vessels and aircraft must first gain Beijing’s permission before transiting, submarines must surface, and that China retains the right to evict other countries’ shipping at any time. Beijing’s willingness to enforce this law has been growing apace with its naval power in the western Pacific. In recent weeks, Beijing has placed the Spratly and Paracel Islands and the Macclesfield Bank under prefectural-level administration, established a 45-member legislature to administer the 1100 people who live on the islands, and approved the deployment of a People’s Liberation Army garrison to the islands. 2. Southeast Asia – avoiding the bad old days </span><span class="UnderlineChar">If unaddressed, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the dynamics</span> in the South China Sea <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">could return</span> Southeast Asia <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to</span> the bad old days of </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">inter-state divisions</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar">, domestic <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">instability </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and</span> competitive <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">great-power interventions</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar">. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">On no other issue have</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">disagreements</span> and rivalries <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">between ASEAN</span> member <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">states been so sustained</span> </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">and obvious. The Philippines and Vietnam demand that the organisation supports them in standing up to Beijing. On the other side are Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, with no direct stake in the conflict and which refuse to endorse the Philippines’ and Vietnam’s confrontational stance. Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore are concerned about the dispute, but believe that avoiding confrontation with China will improve the prospects for productive negotiations. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The stand-off</span> over the South China Sea <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">exposes the hollowness of Asian institutions</span>’ reliance on</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> the principle of </span><span class="UnderlineChar">unanimity</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> – which means that any member’s objection can keep an issue, no matter how pressing, off the agenda. Beijing’s refusal to discuss the South China Sea in any regional meeting, and its implicit threat to withdraw from any organisation that doesn’t respect this wish, shows Southeast Asia’s confidence that it could ‘socialise’ China by welcoming it into regional institutions was misplaced. Asian institutions allow Beijing to make apparent concessions, such as its 2002 agreement with ASEAN to a Declaration of Conduct on the South China Sea, without actually surrendering any part of its position. As China and the United States increase the stakes in the South China Sea, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">ASEAN’s cardinal principle of neutrality is threatened</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia are tightening their strategic relationships with the United States, just as Cambodia, Laos and Thailand deepen their links to China. And there are signs that the disputes have become entangled in domestic politics in the Philippines and Vietnam, making their stances even more uncompromising. In Manila, following allegations that Beijing used corrupt payments to soften the former Arroyo administration’s stance on the South China Sea, the current Aquino administration and its Parliamentary opposition are vying for the most uncompromising policies on the issue. To counter rumours circulating around Hanoi that Beijing has ‘bought’ the Vietnam’s senior leadership, the Vietnamese government has passed a law claiming sovereignty over the Spratly and Paracel Islands. 3. For the United States it’s about Credibility – within limits It is in the South China Sea that Southeast Asia’s anxieties about China overlap with American anxieties about Beijing’s naval buildup. Over the past two years, the United States has taken an active interest and position in what had formerly been a dispute between China and the other claimants. This means there are now in effect two layers to this dispute: a basic stand-off between the territorial claimants; and an overarching strategic contest between Beijing and Washington. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">For the United States, what’s at stake in the South China Sea is the viability of its entire presence in the western Pacific. The US Navy’s access to the South China Sea is contested by Beijing</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. China claims it will respect the freedom of passage of ships and aircraft through the area, on the condition that they are en route to another destination, and do not conduct military exercises or collect intelligence or militarily useful data. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Washington is adamant that the South China Sea’s sea lanes are international </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">waters, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">and are therefore subject to freedom of navigation,</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> which in international law allows the conduct of military exercises and the collection of intelligence and militarily useful data. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">If Washington surrenders its ability to navigate the South China Sea on its own terms, it will lose a major foothold in the western Pacific</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The South China Sea in effect pits a Chinese expansive claim (sovereignty based on historical usage) against an American expansive claim, that freedom of navigation allows the collection of intelligence and military data. The American claim is contested in other waters by Malaysia, Indonesia and India, though supported by other regional countries. China accuses the US of ‘hyping’ the freedom of navigation question, arguing that it hides an intention to use the issue to build a coalition against China. For the Southeast Asian states contesting China’s South China Sea claims, the United States’ presence and interest in the issue is a prerequisite for their position. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Washington</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> is acutely aware that it </span><span class="UnderlineChar">needs to be seen as a reliable ally and partner in the Pacific</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. It realises that its arms-length response to the Asian Financial Crisis eroded its position in Asia and set China on its path towards building soft power in the region. For Southeast Asians worried that Washington’s attention or will to stay in the region may erode, there is virtue in keeping the South China Sea on the agenda. But </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Washington can’t give its allies and partners a blank cheque which allows them to confront</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, and even provoke, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">China</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> from the comfort of the assumption that the United States will back them up. And </span><span class="UnderlineChar">some in Southeast Asia are watching Washington’s moves</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> very </span><span class="UnderlineChar">closely, sensitive that any concession could signal its acceptance of China’s claims in the South China Sea.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> 4. Solutions are Part of the Problem </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Either multilateral mediation or international law is most often used to resolve disputes of this sort </span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">– </span><span class="UnderlineChar">but in the South China Sea they act to exacerbate the situation. Beijing refuses to discuss the dispute in any multilateral context</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, fearing that it will facilitate the formation of a front against China. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The Southeast Asian claimants</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, however, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">are adamant that they must deal with China as a coalition</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, with Manila particularly insistent that ASEAN must negotiate a common position before negotiating with China. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The result is a stand-off</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: the Philippines insists that ASEAN must find a common position before negotiating with China, while China will only negotiate if ASEAN abandons the search for a common position. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">International law</span> also <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">intensifies the dispute. The U</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">nited </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">N</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">ations Convention on the Law of the Sea </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">does not recognise China’s historical claims</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, and therefore cannot serve as the basis for an adjudication of the dispute. Worse, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">because <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">i</span>nternational <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">law relies on unbroken longevity</span> of claims <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">as</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">basis</span> for adjudication, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">none of the parties</span> to the South China Sea dispute <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">can allow others’ claims to pass uncontested</span>, in case <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">this is taken as</span> evidence of its <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">relinquishing of its claim</span>. The result is a steady drum beat of</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> hydrocarbon prospecting, fishing, the </span><span class="UnderlineChar">occupation</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> of islets, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">and maritime clashes</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Policy Implications </span><span class="UnderlineChar">There is a great deal at stake in the South China Sea.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> The dynamics of this issue will impact on China’s evolving international personality, the response of its neighbours to its rising power, and the longevity of the United States’ position in the western Pacific. With the growth of trade and investment around Asia’s IndoPacific coast, the South China Sea will become ever more crowded with shipping and commerce. </span>

That escalates to __territorial disputes__ — the impact is __nuclear war__

<span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The first ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting Plus Eight (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Russia and the USA) was held on the 12th of October. When this frame work of ADMM Plus Eight came into news for the first time it was seen as a development which could be the initiating step to a much needed security architecture in the Asia Pacific. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Asia Pacific is fast emerging as the economic center of the world</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, consequently </span><span class="UnderlineChar">securing</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> of vulnerable economic assets </span><span class="UnderlineChar">has become mandatory</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The source of threat to economic assets is basically unconventional in nature like natural disasters, terrorism and maritime piracy. This coupled with the </span><span class="UnderlineChar">conventional <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">security threats and </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">flashpoints</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> based on territorial disputes</span> and political differences <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> very much a part of the region </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">posing a major security challenge</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. As mentioned ADMM Plus Eight can be seen as the first initiative on such a large scale where the security concerns of the region can be discussed and areas of cooperation can be explored to keep the threats at bay. The defence ministers of the ten ASEAN nations and the eight extra regional countries (Plus Eight) during the meeting have committed to cooperation and dialogue to counter insecurity in the region. One of the major reasons for initiation of such a framework has been the new face of threat which is non-conventional and transnational which makes it very difficult for an actor to deal with it in isolation. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Threats related to <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">violent extremism, maritime security, vulnerability of SLOCs, transnational crimes</span> have</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> a direct and indirect </span><span class="UnderlineChar">bearing on the path of economic growth</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Apart from this </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the existence of territorial disputes</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> especially </span><span class="UnderlineChar">on the maritime front <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">plus the</span> issues related to political differences, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">rise of China and dispute on the Korean Peninsula has aggravated the security dilemma</span> in the region <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">giving rise to areas of </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">potential conflict</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. This can be seen as a more of a conventional threat to the region. The question here is that how far this ADMM Plus Eight can go to address the conventional security threats or is it an initiative which would be confined to meetings and passing resolution and playing second fiddle to the ASEAN summit. It is very important to realize that </span><span class="UnderlineChar">when one is talking about</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> effective </span><span class="UnderlineChar">security</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> architecture </span><span class="UnderlineChar">for the Asia Pacific one has to talk in terms of addressing the conventional issues like the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">territorial</span> and political <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">disputes</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">These issues <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">serve as bigger </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">flashpoint</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> which can </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">snowball into a major conflict</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> which has the possibility of turning into a </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">nuclear conflict</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span>

Realignment to Guam __prevents conflict__ — proximity ensures stability
<span class="CiteChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Kamiya 12</span></span> (Matake Kamiya, is Professor of International Relations at the National Defense Academy of Japan. He was a main author of the report Strategic Implications of an Ongoing Buildup of the US Bases in Guam for Japan, which the Research Institute for Peace and Security published in 2007, ASIANZ Online, 6/20/12, “The Relocation of US Marines from Okinawa to Guam: Strategic Implications for Japan”, [[http://www.asianz.org.nz/our-work/track-2/opinions-essays/matake-kamiya]] | AK)
<span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Since the announcement of the Roadmap, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Tokyo and Washington have consistently emphasized that the planned <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">relocation will reduce the burden on</span> the local <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Okinawans while maintaining a sufficient level of deterrence for the security of</span> Japan and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the region</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The latter part of their assertion is, however, not a matter of course. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The Marines in Okinawa represent approximately one-third</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> to one-quarter (depending on the statistical data used for calculation) </span><span class="UnderlineChar">of the US Forces Japan</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (USFJ) </span><span class="UnderlineChar">in terms of personnel</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.

<span class="CiteChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Caryl 7</span></span> (Christian Caryl, is a senior fellow at the Legatum Institute, a contributing editor at Foreign Policy, and a senior fellow at the MIT Center for International Studies, The Daily Beast, 2/25/07, “America's Unsinkable Fleet”, [[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2007/02/25/america-s-unsinkable-fleet.html]])
<span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">For an out-of-the-way spit of land in the West Pacific, Guam has been getting a lot of interesting visitors recently. First came a steady stream of Pentagon bureaucrats and senior U.S. military officers. Then, a few weeks ago, a high-ranking delegation of Japanese officials arrived. And this week the island is set to greet its most illustrious guest yet: U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney. So why all the fuss over a tropical island just 30 miles long, known mainly for its white-sand beaches and glorious sunsets? The answer: the Pentagon has begun a major redeployment of U.S. forces in the region, pulling troops and equipment out of sometimes unreliable allies and beefing up its presence in more-congenial locales. First on its list is </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Guam</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, a U.S. territory since 1898 that </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is</span> fast becoming <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the linchpin of Washington's new Asia strategy</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Current U.S. forces on the island number just a few thousand but within a decade will total well over 20,000--about the same size as the Bush administration's planned surge in Iraq. By comparison, there are some 29,000 U.S. troops left in South Korea, yet despite the dangers of a nuclear-armed North, that number is expected to drop significantly. At a time when most of the world's attention is focused on the United States' misadventures in Iraq and Afghanistan, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Pentagon <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">planners are</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> quietly </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">working</span> on ways <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to fortify</span> the U.S. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">presence</span> in East Asia</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. And </span><span class="UnderlineChar">they're looking to do so <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">in ways that will give them a free hand in</span> a wide range of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">contingencies</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">--</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">including</span> fighting <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">regional terrorists and a</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> possible </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">showdown with China</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Guam offers</span> the U.S. military</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> both </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">proximity to potential hot spots and</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">advantages of operating off U.S. soil</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The transfer of forces</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> to the island also </span><span class="UnderlineChar">reflects the Pentagon's determination to give regional allies such as South Korea and Japan more responsibility for their own security</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Guam, a sleepy but diverse place that looks like a cross between Micronesia and Middle America, has long served as a U.S. air base and way station for troops traveling through the Pacific. At the end of the cold war, the Pentagon began shutting down some facilities on the island. But then came September 11, and a dramatic reassessment of America's global forces. Former secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld began to advocate the lily-pad strategy: rather than relying on large, static bases in Germany and South Korea, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the Pentagon should create a</span> global <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">network of</span> jumping-off <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">points for quick responses to</span> unpredictable <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">attacks</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Guam is an ideal lily pad</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, since </span><span class="UnderlineChar">t<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">he U</span>nited <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">can act there without</span> seeking <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">permission from allies</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, says Honolulu-based defense analyst Richard Halloran. Declares Carl Peterson of the Guam Chamber of Commerce: "This is the U.S. in Asia. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">This is the tip of the spear</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">." </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The island has</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> already </span><span class="UnderlineChar">become a convenient base for fighting Washington's "Global War on Terror" in Indonesia and the Philippines</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Small wonder that Brig. Gen. Douglas H. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Owens</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, the commanding officer of Guam's Andersen Air Force Base, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">describes the island as "an unsinkable aircraft carrier</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">." It's also well positioned for possible trouble to come. As Rear Adm. Charles Leidig, U.S. Navy commander on Guam, points out, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">if you</span> take a map and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">draw a circle with Guam at the center</span> and a radius of 1,500 nautical miles</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">--equivalent to three hours' flying time or two to three days by ship--</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">you come close to</span> the main islands of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Japan</span>, Okinawa, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Indonesia</span> and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the Philippines. China</span> and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the Korean Peninsula</span> are only a bit farther off</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">So are several of the world's most i<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">mportant sea lanes, such as the Strait of Malacca</span>, through</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> which some </span><span class="UnderlineChar">50 percent of the world's oil passes</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> each year. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The Pentagon</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, however, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">may be building up its forces on Guam with even bigger game in mind</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. "</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The larger strategic rationale</span> [for the shift</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">] can be summed up in one word, and that's </span><span class="UnderlineChar">'China'</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">," says Halloran. "They [the Bush administration] don't want to contain China, and they couldn't. What </span><span class="UnderlineChar">they are trying to do is to deter the Chinese</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">That's what the buildup on Guam is all about</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">." The nature of the U.S. reorganization reinforces this point. Washington and Tokyo have agreed to move 8,000 Marines to Guam from Okinawa by 2014, at a cost of $10 billion (60 percent of which will be paid for by the Japanese government). But this is only the most public part of a broader buildup that has largely escaped notice. If all the pieces come together, it could mean billions more in Defense Department funds and a total increase in Guam's population (which is currently just 170,000) of 35,000. Guam is already home to a major U.S. Navy port and one of the biggest bases in the U.S. Air Force, featuring twin two-mile-long runways. Not long after September 11, flights of massive B-52 bombers began returning to Andersen to carry out regular training missions. Now the Air Force has begun to prepare for the deployment of tanker aircraft and up to 48 fighter planes, including the state-of-the-art F-22 Raptor. Andersen has also already started construction of a $52.8 million project that will house up to 10 Global Hawks--large unmanned spy planes that, according to Pacific Command Air Force Gen. Paul Hester, could end up replacing aging U-2 spy planes now based in South Korea. Meanwhile, the Navy has turned its port at Guam's Apra Harbor into a home for two Los Angeles-class nuclear-powered attack submarines, with a third to come later this year. It also plans to refurbish wharves to accommodate aircraft carriers and to transform Guam into a base for its new Littoral Combat Ship (a shallow-draft stealth ship designed to operate close to shore) and Trident submarines. The Tridents, immense cold-war-era craft converted to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles, can also be used by Navy Special Operations Forces, who can set off on missions in mini-submarines launched through the Tridents' missile ports. Guam is already home to an undisclosed number of Navy SEALs, many of whom have seen duty in the war on terror, and their number will likely grow. Guam's new capabilities, however, are designed for more than just low-intensity conflicts. The attack submarines that will soon be based there, for example, probably wouldn't be much use in a conflict with North Korea or Qaeda-allied terrorists in the Philippines; </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the presence of the subs</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, experts say, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is</span> clearly aimed at <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the possibility of</span> a <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">naval confrontation with China</span> over the Taiwan Strait</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Similarly, analysts argue, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the stationing of F-22s and tanker planes on Guam points to the Pentagon's desire to ensure dominance in the air should it have to fight the Chinese</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. China's media often worry about just this scenario, but not everyone agrees that China is the main target of the Guam buildup. Evan Medeiros of the RAND Corporation says "the initial impetus and primary driver" were to restructure the U.S. military for the wide range of operations it now faces, from fighting the war on terror to chasing pirates and conducting humanitarian missions. In the complicated post-9/11 world, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the United States believes it must be able <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to respond</span> to various threats <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">as flexibly as possible</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">This <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">means keeping</span> its <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">forces close to the action</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. In the past that's required basing them in other countries' territories. But </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Guam offers</span> an</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> almost </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">unique combination of</span> a <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">good location, excellent facilities</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (including a topnotch harbor, vast warehouses and massive airfields) </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and</span> a <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">lack of political restraints</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. As Kurt Campbell, a former White House staffer and Defense Department official now at the Center for a New American Security, says, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">"[Guam is] a point from which you can do a variety of things</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. And </span><span class="UnderlineChar">it's a place to remind people that you're still focused on the region</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">." Campbell points out that these secondary missions, such as </span><span class="UnderlineChar">protecting sea lanes, countering weapons proliferation and conducting relief missions, remain important</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">; the U.S. military's humanitarian efforts after the tsunami of December 2005 gave a huge boost to the country's reputation in Asia. Brad Glosserman, executive director of Pacific Forum CSIS, a Hawaii-based think tank, agrees. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The Asia-Pacific region</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, he says, "</span><span class="UnderlineChar">is a jigsaw puzzle where all the pieces are changing shape and size all the time</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. China's the big story--but there are also changes going in on Japan, India, South Korea, Taiwan." One such development driving the move to Guam has been the steady withdrawal of the United States from South Korea in recent years (more than 9,000 troops have left in the last three years)--a result, in part, of rising anti-Americanism there and Rumsfeld's reluctance to keep troops in politically sensitive places. Some Air Force units that have pulled out of South Korea have already arrived on Guam; others may be yet to come. That, along with the planned removal of the Marines from Okinawa, has led some commentators to characterize the Guam expansion as evidence of a virtual U.S. retreat from East Asia. But Campbell and others disagree: "</span><span class="UnderlineChar">I would see this not as a retrenchment but as a diversification</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">." Indeed, after years of maintaining an even balance between its Atlantic and Pacific fleets, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the U.S. Navy is now clearly emphasizing its force in Asia</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Whatever the rationale, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the changes represent good news for Guam's population</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The locals were hit hard in the early 1990s when the U.S. military's post-cold-war drawdown, combined with the Asian financial crises and the resulting plunge in tourism, caused the loss of thousands of skilled and unskilled jobs on the island. Guamanians are hoping that </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the Pentagon's new plan can bring billions in investment into the territory as well as </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">new support for its sagging infrastructure</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Contractors are already maneuvering for deals to build housing and other structures. Real-estate prices shot up 50 percent between 2005 and 2006 and there were more property sales in the fourth quarter of last year than in all of 2003. To be sure, hurdles remain, such as ensuring that the Marines from Okinawa actually make the move. The deal, which requires Japanese cooperation, has already run into political problems there. Then there's the possibility that local activists in Guam will throw a wrench into the works. Some of Guam's indigenous Chamorro people, who wield great influence on the island, have opposed the changes, warning that the military could overrun the island. The Pentagon, which already controls one third of the territory, has promised not to expand this share, but that pledge could prove hard to keep. Still, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">most <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Guamanians support the buildup, given their</span> traditional <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">patriotism</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">--traumatic memories linger of Japan's occupation during World War II--</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and</span> the potential <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">economic benefits</span> the rebasing will bring</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Guam's significance as a</span> regional base and </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">steppingstone for U.S. military power</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"> therefore <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">seems set to grow exponentially</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Notes Gov. Felix Camacho: "We can no longer be ignored as some distant American territory." He seems right about that. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">If</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, as many in the region predict, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the 21st century ends up belonging to the nations of the Pacific--and conflict in the region rises--Guam will</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> have to </span><span class="UnderlineChar">get</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> used to being </span><span class="UnderlineChar">in the headlines</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span>

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">As so broadly conceived, there is strong evidence that <span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">deterrence</span></span>, that is, t<span class="UnderlineChar">he effect of external factors on the decision to go to war, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is</span> </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">missing</span> link <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">in the war/peace equation</span></span>. In my War/Peace Seminar, I have undertaken to examine the level of deterrence before the principal wars of the twentieth century.10 This examination has led me to believe that in every case the potential aggressor made a rational calculation that the war would be won, and won promptly.11 In fact, the longest period of time calculated for victory through conventional attack seems to be the roughly six reeks predicted by the German General Staff as the time necessary ) prevail on the Western front in World War I under the Schlieffen Plan. Hitler believed in his attack on Poland that Britain and France could not take the occasion to go to war with him. And he believed his 1941 Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union that “[w]e have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down."12 In contrast, following Hermann Goering's failure to obtain air superiority in the Battle of Britain, Hitler called off the invasion of Britain and shifted strategy to the nighttime bombing of population centers, which became known as the Blitz, in a mistaken effort to compel Britain to sue for peace. Calculations in the North Korean attack on South Korea and Hussein’s attack on Kuwait were that the operations would be completed in a matter of days. Indeed, <span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">virtually all</span> principal <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">wars in the twentieth century</span>, at least those involving conventional invasion, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">were preceded by</span> what I refer to as <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a "</span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">double deterrence absence</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar">.</span>" That is, the potential aggressor believed that they had the military force in place to prevail promptly and that nations that might have the military or diplomatic power to prevent this were not dined to intervene. This analysis has also shown that many of the perceptions we have about the origins of particular wars are flatly wrong. Anyone who seriously believes that World War I was begun by competing alliances drawing tighter should examine the al historical record of British unwillingness to enter a clear military alliance with the French or to so inform the Kaiser! Indeed, this <span class="UnderlineChar">pre-World War I </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">absence of effective alliance and resultant war</span><span class="UnderlineChar"> contrasts sharply with the later </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">robust NATO alliance and absence of World War III.</span><span class="UnderlineChar">14 </span>
<span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Considerable</span></span> other <span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">evidence seems to support this historical</span> analysis as to the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">importance of deterrence</span></span>. Of particular note, Yale Professor Donald <span class="UnderlineChar">Kagan</span>, a preeminent United States historian who has long taught a seminar on war, published in 1995 a superb book On the Origins of War and the Preservation of Peace.15 In this book he <span class="UnderlineChar">conducts a detailed examination of <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the Peloponnesian War, World War I, Hannibal's War, and World War II, among other</span> case <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">studies</span>. A careful reading of these studies <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">suggest</span>s that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">each</span> war <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">could have been prevented by achievable deterrence </span>and that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">each occurred in the absence of</span> such <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">deterrence</span></span>.16 <span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Game theory</span></span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> seems to offer</span> yet <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">further support </span>for the proposition that appropriate </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">deterrence can prevent war</span>. For example, Robert Axelrod's famous 1980s experiment in an iterated prisoner's dilemma, which is a reasonably close proxy for many conflict settings in international relations, repeatedly showed the effectiveness of a simple tit for tat strategy.17 <span class="UnderlineChar">Such a strategy is at core simply a basic deterrent strategy of influencing behavior through incentives</span>. Similarly, <span class="UnderlineChar">much of the game-theoretic work on crisis bargaining</span> (and danger of asymmetric information) <span class="UnderlineChar">in relation to war and the democratic peace assumes the importance of deterrence through communication of incentives</span>.18 The well-known correlation between war and territorial contiguity seems also to underscore the importance of deterrence and is likely principally a proxy for levels of perceived profit and military achievability of aggression in many such settings.
It should further be noted that the democratic peace is not the only significant correlation with respect to war and peace, although it seems to be the most robust. Professors Russett and Oneal, in recently exploring the other elements of the Kantian proposal for "Perpetual Peace," have also shown a strong and statistically significant correlation between economically important bilateral trade between two nations and a reduction in the risk of war between them. Contrary to the arguments of "dependency theorists," such economically important trade seems to reduce the risk of war regardless of the size relationship or asymmetry in the trade balance between the two states. In addition, there is a statistically significant association between economic openness generally and reduction in the risk of war, although this association is not as strong as the effect of an economically important bilateral trade relationship.° Russett and Oneal also show a modest independent correlation between reduction in the risk of war and higher levels of common membership in international organizations.20 And they show that a large imbalance of power between two states significantly lessens the risk of major war between them.21 All of these empirical findings about war also seem to directly reflect incentives; that is, a higher level of trade would, if foregone in war, impose higher costs in the aggregate than without such trade,22 though we know that not all wars terminate trade. Moreover, with respect to trade, a, classic study, Economic Interdependence and War, suggests that the historic record shows that it is not simply aggregate levels of bilateral trade that matters, but expectations as to the level of trade into the future.23 This directly implicates expectations of the war decision maker as does incentive theory, and it importantly adds to the general finding about trade and war that even with existing high levels of bilateral trade, changing expectations from trade sanctions or other factors affecting the flow of trade can directly affect incentives and influence for or against war. A large imbalance of power in a relationship rather obviously impacts deterrence and incentives. Similarly, one might incur higher costs with high levels of common membership in international organizations through foregoing some of the heightened benefits of such participation or otherwise being presented with different options through the actions or effects of such organizations.
These external deterrence elements may also be yet another reason why democracies have a lower risk of war with one another. For their freer markets, trade, commerce, and international engagement may place them in a position where their generally higher level of interaction means that aggression will incur substantial opportunity costs. Thus, the "mechanism" of the democratic peace may be an aggregate of factors affecting incentives, both external as well as internal factors. Because of the underlying truth in the relationship between higher levels of trade and lower levels of war, it is not surprising that theorists throughout human history, including Baron de Montesquieu in 1748, Thomas Paine in 1792, John Stuart Mill in 1848, and, most recently, the founders of the European Union, have argued that increasing commerce and interactions among nations would end war. Though by themselves these arguments have been overoptimistic, it may well be that some level of "globalization" may make the costs of war and the gains of peace so high as to powerfully predispose to peace. Indeed, a 1989 book by John Mueller, Retreat From Doomsday,24 postulates the obsolescence of major war between developed nations (at least those nations within the "first and second worlds") as they become increasingly conscious of the rising costs of war and the rising gains of peace.
In assessing levels of democracy, there are indexes readily available, for example, the Polity III25 and Freedom House 26 indexes. I am unaware of any comparable index with respect to levels of deterrence that might be used to test the importance of deterrence in war avoidance?' Absent such an accepted index, discussion about the importance of deterrence is subject to the skeptical observation that one simply defines effective deterrence by whether a war did or did not occur. In order to begin to deal with this objection and encourage a more objective methodology for assessing deterrence, I encouraged a project to seek to develop a rough but objective measure of deterrence with a scale from minus ten to plus ten based on a large variety of contextual features that would be given relative weighting in a complex deterrence equation before applying the scaling to different war and nonwar settings.28 On the disincentive side of the scale, the methodology used a weighted calculation of local deterrence, including the chance to prevent a short- and intermediate-term military victory, and economic and political disincentives; extended deterrence with these same elements; and contextual communication and credibility multipliers. On the incentive side of the scale, the methodology also used a weighted calculation of perceived military, economic, and political benefits. The scales were then combined into an overall deterrence score, including, an estimate for any effect of prospect theory where applicable.2 This innovative first effort uniformly showed high deterrence scores in settings where war did not, in fact, occur. Deterring a Soviet first strike in the Cuban Missile Crisis produced a score of +8.5 and preventing a Soviet attack against NATO produced a score of +6. War settings, however, produced scores ranging from -2.29 (Saddam Hussein's decision to invade Kuwait in the Gulf War), -2.18 (North Korea's decision to invade South Korea in the Korean War), -1.85 (Hitler's decision to invade Poland in World War II), -1.54 (North Vietnam's decision to invade South Vietnam following the Paris Accords), -0.65 (Milosevic's decision to defy NATO in Kosovo), +0.5 (the Japanese decision to attack Pearl Harbor), +1.25 (the Austrian decision, egged on by Germany, to attack Serbia, which was the real beginning of World War I), to +1.75 (the German decision to invade Belgium and France in World War I). As a further effort at scaling and as a point of comparison, I undertook to simply provide an impressionistic rating based on my study of each pre-crisis setting. That produced high positive scores of +9 for both deterring a Soviet first strike during the Cuban Missile Crisis and NATO's deterrence of a Warsaw Pact attack and even lower scores than the more objective effort in settings where wars had occurred. Thus, I scored North Vietnam's decision to invade South Vietnam following the Paris Accords and the German decision to invade Poland at the beginning of World War II as -6; the North Korean/Stalin decision to invade South Korea in the Korean War as -5; the Iraqi decision to invade the State of Kuwait as -4; Milosevic's decision to defy NATO in Kosovo and the German decision to invade Belgium and France in World War I as -2; and the Austrian decision to attack Serbia and the Japanese decision to attack Pearl Harbor as -1. Certainly <span class="UnderlineChar">even knowledgeable experts would be likely to differ in their impressionistic scores on such pre-crisis settings, and the effort at a more objective methodology for scoring deterrence leaves much to be desired. Nevertheless, both exercises did seem to suggest that deterrence matters and that high levels of deterrence can prevent future war. </span>
Following up on this initial effort to produce a more objective measure of deterrence, two years later I encouraged another project to undertake the same effort, building on what had been learned in the first iteration. The result was a second project that developed a modified scoring system, also incorporating local deterrence, extended deterrence, and communication of intent and credibility multipliers on one side of a scale, and weighing these factors against a potential aggressor's overall subjective incentives for action on the other side of the scale.3° The result, with a potential range of -5.5 to +10, produced no score higher than +2.5 for eighteen major wars studied between 1939 and the 1990 Gulf War.31 Twelve of the eighteen wars produced a score of zero or below, with the 1950-53 Korean War at -3.94, the 1965-75 Vietnam War at -0.25, the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War at -1.53, and the 1990-91 Gulf War at -3.83. <span class="UnderlineChar">The study concluded that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">in more than fifty years</span> of conflict the<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">re was "no situation in which a regime</span> elite/decision making body subjectively <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">faced</span> substantial <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">disincentives to aggressive military action and</span> yet <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">attacked</span></span>."32
Yet another piece of the puzzle, which may clarify the extent of deterrence necessary in certain settings, may also assist in building a broader hypothesis about war. In fact, it has been incorporated into the just-discussed efforts at scoring deterrence.
That is, <span class="UnderlineChar">newer <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">studies of human behavior from cognitive psychology are increasingly showing that certain perceptions of decision makers</span> can <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">influence the level of risk they</span> may be willing to <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">undertake</span>, or otherwise affect their decisions</span>.33 It now seems likely that a number of such insights about human behavior in decision making may be useful in considering and fashioning deterrence strategies. Perhaps of greatest relevance is <span class="UnderlineChar">the insight of "prospect theory," which posits that individuals evaluate outcomes with respect to deviations from a reference point and that they may be more risk averse in settings posing potential gain than in settings posing potential loss</span>.34 The evidence of this "cognitive bias," whether in gambling, trading, or, as is increasingly being argued, foreign policy decisions generally, is significant. Because of the newness of efforts to apply a laboratory based "prospect theory" to the complex foreign policy process generally, and particularly ambiguities and uncertainties in framing such complex events, our consideration of it in the war/peace process should certainly be cautious. It does, however, seem to elucidate some of the case studies.
In the war/peace setting, "<span class="UnderlineChar">prospect theory" suggests that deterrence may not need to be as strong to prevent aggressive action leading to perceived gain</span>. For example, there is credible evidence that even an informal warning to Kaiser Wilhelm II from British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, if it had come early in the crisis before events had moved too far, might have averted World War I. And even a modicum of deterrence in Kuwait, as was provided by a small British contingent when Kuwait was earlier threatened by an irredentist Iraqi government in 1961, might have been sufficient to deter Saddam Hussein from his 1990 attack on Kuwait. Similarly, even a clear United States pledge for the defense of South Korea before the attack might have prevented the Korean War. Conversely, following the July 28 Austrian mobilization and declaration of war against Serbia in World War I, the issue for Austria may have begun to be perceived as loss avoidance, thus requiring much higher levels of deterrence to avoid the resulting war. Similarly, the Rambouillet Agreement may have been perceived by Milosevic as risking loss of Kosovo and his continued rule of Serbia and, as a result, may have required higher levels of NA-TO deterrence to have prevented Milosevic's actions in defiance. Certainly NATO's previous hesitant responses in 1995 against Milosevic in the Bosnia phase of the Yugoslav crisis and in 1998-99 in early attempts to deal with Kosovo did not create a high level of deterrence.35 One can only surmise whether the killing in Kosovo could have been avoided had NATO taken a different tack, both structuring the issue less as loss avoidance for Milosevic and considerably enhancing deterrence. Suppose, for example, NATO had emphasized that it had no interest in intervening in Serbia's civil conflict with the KLA but that it would emphatically take action to punish massive "ethnic cleansing" and other humanitarian outrages, as had been practiced in Bosnia. And on the deterrence side, it made clear in advance the severity of any NATO bombardment, the potential for introduction of ground troops if necessary, that in any assault it would pursue a "Leadership Strategy" focused on targets of importance to Milosevic and his principal henchmen (including their hold on power), and that it would immediately, unlike as earlier in Bosnia, seek to generate war crime indictments of all top Serbian leaders implicated in any atrocities. The point here is not to second-guess NATO's actions in Kosovo but to suggest that taking into account potential "cognitive bias," such as "prospect theory," may be useful in fashioning effective deterrence. "<span class="UnderlineChar">Prospect theory" may also have relevance in predicting that it may be easier to deter</span> (that is, lower levels are necessary) <span class="UnderlineChar">an aggression than to undo that aggression</span>. Thus, much higher levels of deterrence were probably required to compel Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait than to prevent him initially from invading that state. In fact, not even the presence of a powerful Desert Storm military force and a Security Council Resolution directing him to leave caused Hussein to voluntarily withdraw. As this real-world example illustrates, there is considerable experimental evidence in "prospect theory" of an almost instant renormalization of reference point after a gain; that is, relatively quickly after Saddam Hussein took Kuwait, a withdrawal was framed as a loss setting, which he would take high risk to avoid. Indeed, we tend to think of such settings as settings of compellance, requiring higher levels of incentive to achieve compulsion producing an action, rather than deterrence needed for prevention.
One should also be careful not to overstate the effect of "prospect theory" or to fail to assess a threat in its complete context. We should remember that a belated pledge of Great Britain to defend Poland before the Nazi attack did not deter Hitler, who believed under the circumstances that the British pledge would not be honored. It is also possible that the greater relative wealth of democracies, which have less to gain in all out war, is yet another internal factor contributing to the "democratic peace."36 In turn, this also supports the extraordinary tenacity and general record of success of democracies fighting in defensive settings as they may also have more to lose.
In assessing adequacy of deterrence to prevent war, we might also want to consider whether extreme ideology, strongly at odds with reality, may be a factor requiring higher levels of deterrence for effectiveness. One example may be the extreme ideology of Pol Pot leading him to falsely believe that his Khmer Rouge forces could defeat Vietnam.37 He apparently acted on that belief in a series of border incursions against Vietnam that ultimately produced a losing war for him. Similarly, Osama bin Laden's 9/11 attack against America, hopelessly at odds with the reality of his defeating the Western World and producing for him a strategic disaster, seems to have been prompted by his extreme ideology rooted in a distorted concept of Islam at war with the enlightenment. The continuing suicide bombings against Israel, encouraged by radical rejectionists and leading to less and less for the Palestinians, may be another example. If extreme ideology is a factor to be considered in assessing levels of deterrence, it does not mean that deterrence is doomed to fail in such settings but only that it must be at higher levels (and properly targeted on the relevant decision elites behind the specific attacks) to be effective, as is also true in perceived loss or compellance settings.38 Even if major war in the modern world is predominantly a result of aggression by nondemocratic regimes, it does not mean that all nondemocracies pose a risk of war all, or even some, of the time. Salazar's Portugal did not commit aggression. Nor today do Singapore or Bahrain or countless other nondemocracies pose a threat. That is, today <span class="UnderlineChar">nondemocracy comes close to a necessary condition in generating the high risk behavior leading to major interstate war</span>. But <span class="UnderlineChar">it is, by itself, not a sufficient condition for war</span>. The many reasons for this, of course, include a plethora of internal factors, such as differences in leadership perspectives and values, size of military, and relative degree of the rule of law, as well as levels of external deterrence.39 But <span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">where an aggressive nondemocratic regime is present and poses a credible military threat, then it is </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the totality of external factors</span></span><span style="background: yellow;">, </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">that is, deterrence, that become crucial.</span> </span></span>

These bioweapons go global in __6 weeks__ — outweighs nuclear war

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Immediately following 9-11, an anthrax attack originating from letters containing anthrax spores infected 22 people, killing five. After almost six years, the case has not been solved. </span>Intelligence <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">analysts and academics report</span> that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">North Korea has developed anthrax, plague, and botulism toxin</span> and conducted extensive research on smallpox, typhoid and cholera<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. A world-renowned bioweapons expert has confirmed that Syria has weapons grade smallpox resistant to all current vaccines developed under the cover of legitimate veterinary research on camelpox, a very closely related virus. The researcher further reports that Syria is suspected of testing the pathogen on prison populations and possibly in the Sudan. Although there are close to 50 organisms that could be used offensively, rogue nations have concentrated their bioweapons development efforts on smallpox, anthrax, plague, botulinum, tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fevers. With the exception of smallpox, which is exclusively a human host disease, all of the other pathogens lend themselves to animal testing as they are zoonotic, or can be transmitted to humans by other species<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span></span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Biological weapons</span> are among the most dangerous in the world today and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">can be engineered </span>and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">disseminated to achieve a **more deadly result than a nuclear attack**</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Whereas the explosion of a nuclear bomb would cause massive death in a specific location,</span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a biological attack</span> with smallpox <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">could infect multitudes</span> of people across the globe.

<span class="UnderlineChar">The <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">potential for miscalculation</span> leading to escalation is</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> arguably </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">higher than</span> at <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">any time since the</span> end of the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Cold War</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The risk of serious conflict between China and Japan over maritime territory in the East China Sea is growing, and the prospect of a naval clash in the South China Sea is real</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.
Yet </span><span class="UnderlineChar">these threats appear stable when compared <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">with the</span> highly fluid <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">situation on the</span> Korean <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">peninsula</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Recent developments appear drearily familiar.
The ritualistic North Korean sabre-rattling is countered by carefully crafted signals of extended deterrence intent, which in turn is followed by even more hair-raising statements from Pyongyang that turn out to be mere rhetoric. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Why should we be any more concerned than</span> when North Korea struck Yeongpyeong</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> Island </span><span class="UnderlineChar">in <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">2010?
There is <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">good reason</span> to justify</span> deeper <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">concern over</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> how </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the current crisis</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> will play out. The obvious grounds are that </span><span class="UnderlineChar">North Korea has emerged as the world's ninth nuclear weapons state</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">significant yield produced by Pyongyang's</span> third <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">nuclear test</span> this year <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">laid to rest</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> any existing </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">doubts its 2009 test was</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> somehow </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a</span> lucky <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">fluke</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (the 2006 test was widely acknowledged as a fizzer). Conservative estimates are that North Korea today possesses enough fissile material to build up to eight deployable nuclear warheads.
Some "proliferation optimists" still maintain North Korea will be averse to taking risks because nuclear weapons induce caution - this perspective claims that North Korea will not behave any more recklessly than the other eight nuclear powers that preceded it.
However, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">proliferation <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">optimism</span> in the case of North Korea <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is becoming less convincing</span> day <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">by day</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">A number of explicit <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">references to using nuclear weapons</span> has <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">appeared in recent</span> North Korean <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">statements</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">military high command has</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> openly </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">referred to "precision nuclear striking tools</span>" in comments about reunification <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and the regime has displayed maps</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> to the outside world </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">with US cities as</span> designated <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">targets</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">This is hardly evidence of restraint</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and some searching questions need to be asked about whether we are dealing with a leadership in Pyongyang whose grasp on reality is tenuous at best.
The Pyongyang regime's attempts at nuclear coercion have rightly been brushed aside by the US and South Korea, and the strong extended deterrence intent signalled by Washington this week confirms North Korea can expect an overwhelming response should it move to employ nuclear weapons in a crisis. But is the inexperienced Kim Jong-un persuaded by the credibility of US signalling? </span>
<span class="UnderlineChar">Emboldened by his possession of nuclear weapons and a missile strike force with an expanding combat radius</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> 30-year-old </span><span class="UnderlineChar">leader</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> is determined to fill the large shoes of his father and </span><span class="UnderlineChar">may be tempted to initiate low-level conflict</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> to impress hard heads in the upper echelons of his military.
Assuming (wrongly) that Washington and Seoul will be deterred from responding out of fear North Korea will escalate further, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the young Kim will have</span> no choice but <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to escalate when his bluff is called</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Having made a stand against Pyongyang's aggression, the US and South Korea will be likewise committed to respond. De-escalating without backing down in such circumstances will be close to impossible. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Inadvertent <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">escalation to <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">major war</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, potentially </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">involving nuclear weapons</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">will be hard to avoid</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span>

The problem is that </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the North Koreans make so many threatening</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and bizarre </span><span class="UnderlineChar">official statements and sustain such a high level of military readiness that <span style="background: yellow; border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; mso-highlight: yellow; padding: 0in;">America</span><span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">n policymakers <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">might fail to recognize</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">signs of impending attack</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. After all, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; mso-highlight: yellow; padding: 0in;">every recent</span><span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;"> U.S. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">war began with miscalc</span>ulation</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">; </span><span class="UnderlineChar">American policymakers misunderstood the intent of their opponents, who</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> in turn </span><span class="UnderlineChar">underestimated American determination</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">conflict with</span> North <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Korea could repeat this</span> pattern</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. ¶ Since the regime of Kim Jong Un has continued its predecessors’ tradition of responding hysterically to every action and statement it doesn't like, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">it's hard to assess exactly what might push Pyongyang over the edge and cause it to lash out</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. It could be something that the United States considers modest and reasonable, or it could be some sort of internal power struggle within the North Korean regime invisible to the outside world. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">While <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">we cannot know</span> whether</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> the </span><span class="UnderlineChar">recent</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> round of </span><span class="UnderlineChar">threats</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> from Pyongyang </span><span class="UnderlineChar">is serious or simply more of the same old lathering</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">it would be prudent to <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">think the unthinkable</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and reason through what a war instigated by a fearful and delusional North Korean regime might mean for U.S. security. ¶ </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The second Korean <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">War could begin with missile strikes</span> against South Korean, Japanese or U.S. targets</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, or with a combination of missile strikes and a major conventional invasion of the South -- something North Korea has prepared for many decades. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; mso-highlight: yellow; padding: 0in;">Early attacks might include nuc</span><span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">lear weapon<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">s</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, but even if they didn't, the United States would probably move quickly to destroy any existing North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. ¶ </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The war itself would be extremely costly and</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> probably </span><span class="UnderlineChar">long</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. North Korea is the most militarized society on earth. Its armed forces are backward but huge. It's hard to tell whether the North Korean people, having been fed a steady diet of propaganda based on adulation of the Kim regime, would resist U.S. and South Korean forces that entered the North or be thankful for relief from their brutally parasitic rulers. As the conflict in Iraq showed, the United States and its allies should prepare for widespread, protracted resistance even while hoping it doesn't occur. Extended guerrilla operations and insurgency could potentially last for years following the defeat of North Korea's conventional military. North Korea would need massive relief, as would South Korea and Japan if Pyongyang used nuclear weapons. Stabilizing North Korea and developing an effective and peaceful regime would require a lengthy occupation, whether U.S.-dominated or with the United States as a major contributor. ¶ </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The second Korean War would force military mobilization in the U</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">nited </span><span class="UnderlineChar">S</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">tates. This would initially involve the military's existing reserve component, but </span><span class="UnderlineChar">it would</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> probably ultimately </span><span class="UnderlineChar">require a major expansion of the U.S. military and</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> hence </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">a draft</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The military's training infrastructure and the defense industrial base would have to grow. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">This would be a <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">body blow to efforts to cut government spending</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> in the United States </span><span class="UnderlineChar">and postpone serious deficit reduction for some time</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">even if Washington increased taxes to help fund the war</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Moreover, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">a second Korean <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">conflict would</span> <span style="background: yellow; border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; mso-highlight: yellow; padding: 0in;">shock the global economy</span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> potentially </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; mso-highlight: yellow; padding: 0in;">have destabilizing effects outside Northeast Asia</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. ¶ Eventually, though, the United States and its allies would defeat the North Korean military. At that point it would be impossible for the United States to simply re-establish the status quo ante bellum as it did after the first Korean War. The Kim regime is too unpredictable, desperate and dangerous to tolerate. Hence regime change and a permanent ending to the threat from North Korea would have to be America's strategic objective. ¶ China would pose the most pressing and serious challenge to such a transformation of North Korea. After all, Beijing's intervention saved North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung after he invaded South Korea in the 1950s, and Chinese assistance has kept the subsequent members of the Kim family dictatorship in power. Since the second Korean War would invariably begin like the first one -- with North Korean aggression -- hopefully China has matured enough as a great power to allow the world to remove its dangerous allies this time. If the war began with out-of-the-blue North Korean missile strikes, China could conceivably even contribute to a multinational operation to remove the Kim regime. ¶ Still, China would vehemently oppose a long-term U.S. military presence in North Korea or a unified Korea allied with the United States. One way around this might be a grand bargain leaving a unified but neutral Korea. However appealing this might be, Korea might hesitate to adopt neutrality as it sits just across the Yalu River from a China that tends to claim all territory that it controlled at any point in its history. ¶ If the aftermath of the second Korean War is not handled adroitly, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the result could</span> easily <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">be</span> heightened <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">hostility between the U</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">nited </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">S</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">tates </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and China</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, perhaps even a new cold war. After all, history shows that </span><span class="UnderlineChar">deep <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">economic connections do not</span> automatically <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">prevent </span>nations from hostility and <span style="background: yellow; border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; mso-highlight: yellow; padding: 0in;">war</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> -- in 1914 Germany was heavily involved in the Russian economy and had extensive trade and financial ties with France and Great Britain. It is not inconceivable then, that after the second Korean War, U.S.-China relations would be antagonistic and hostile at the same time that the two continued mutual trade and investment. Stranger things have happened in statecraft.</span>

<span class="UnderlineChar">North Korea never stops threatening its enemies. The</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> belligerent </span><span class="UnderlineChar">dictatorship routinely threatens to turn Seoul</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, the capital of South Korea, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">into a “sea of fire</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.” Recent videos have threatened America with nuclear annihilation. Of course, after countless threats aren’t followed with action, the world wonders when to believe it. The young leader </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Kim Jong-un is presiding over an administration</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, however, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">that shows a dangerous pattern</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. Over the years, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">North Korea has repeatedly attacked allied military and civilian targets</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, including assassination attempts against the South Korean president, blowing up a civilian airliner, shooting down a U.S. Air Force plane, and seizing a U.S. Navy ship. This month, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">North Korea nullified the armistice</span> ending the Korean War</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">moved artillery closer to the demilitarized zone</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">and warned South Koreans on border islands to evacuate</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. All </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">this suggests</span> greater <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">potential for another attack</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">—perhaps imminent—</span><span class="UnderlineChar">on South Korean military and civilian targets</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. North Korea announced on Tuesday that it had put all of its artillery and rocket forces on the highest state of wartime alert, including those units “assigned to strike U.S. imperialist aggressor bases on the U.S. mainland and on Hawaii and Guam and other operational zones in the Pacific, as well as all enemy targets in South Korea.” </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">South Korea</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">n President Park Geun-hye </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">has vowed to respond forcefully</span> to the next North Korean attack</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">—and Seoul should counter-strike the next time North Korea attacks. If there are no consequences, the north will continue its attacks. Of course, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">a stronger response from South Korea could mean escalation</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, and the </span><span class="UnderlineChar">U.S. must be prepared to join its ally</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. In fact, we are committed. On March 22, Washington and Seoul signed a Combined Counter-Provocation Plan to counter North Korean tactical-level attacks. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The plan provides for a “strong</span> and decisive combined South Korean and <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">U.S. response</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.” </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">But </span></span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">friends</span>—<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and enemies</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">—</span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are questioning U.S. ability to deliver on</span> its <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">security</span> promises.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> North Korea’s threats prompted the Obama Administration to reverse some of its reductions in </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">missile defense</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> recently, but that </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is not nearly enough</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.

<span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The U.S. and Japan</span>ese governments <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">agreed to relocate the air station</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, currently in Okinawa’s Ginowan City, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to a more remote area</span> of the island</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The plan also would move</span> about <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">8,000 Marines</span> now <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">based on Okinawa to Guam</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, in line with U.S. defense priorities in the Asia-Pacific region.
“In the April 2012 2+2 Joint Statement, the United States and Japan reconfirmed the view that the current Futenma replacement facility plan at Camp Schwab-Henoko Bay remains the only viable alternative to the continued use of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma,” Little said.</span>
<span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">This effort</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, he added, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is critical to the</span> Defense Department’s ongoing <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">rebalance to</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Asia</span>-Pacific region and its ability to maintain a well-distributed and politically sustainable force throughout Asia</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.
Little said that </span><span class="UnderlineChar">along with the relocation of Marines to Guam</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma will reduce the U.S. footprint in the most populated part of Okinawa</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">It will also enable the return of significant land south of Kadena Air Base while sustaining</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> U.S. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">military capabilities vital to the peace and security of the region</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, he added.
“</span><span class="UnderlineChar">We will be working with the Japanese government to jointly release these plans for land returns</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> soon,” Little said. “</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">We look forward to</span> continuing to work with the Japanese government</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> on these issues </span><span class="UnderlineChar">and</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> to </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">moving ahead with the relocation of Marines to Guam</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">.” </span>

Construction of </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the GRN is</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> required </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to provide</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> mission-critical </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; mso-highlight: yellow; padding: 0in;">transportation infrastructure</span><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> as part of the</span> planned <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">construction, training, and operations associated with</span> the</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> three proposed </span><span class="UnderlineChar">military actions</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (Figure 1.1-1). First, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the GRN must accommodate <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">increased traffic from the</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> island’s military </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">relocation</span> of</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> approximately 8,600 </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Marines from the III Marine Expeditionary Force</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and their dependents </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">from Okinawa</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> by 2014. Aviation and waterfront operations; training; construction of the main cantonment, family housing, and associated utilities; and infrastructure improvements represent the scope of activities to be conducted in support of Marine Corps projects on the island. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Roadway improvements are needed to support</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> both </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">construction of</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">facilities and the</span> ensuing <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">traffic related to the</span> military <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">relocation</span> on Guam</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">Roadway improvements are</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> also </span><span class="UnderlineChar">related to construction of operational facilities, the main cantonment, and family housing on Guam, and training to support the Marine Corps</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">’ defensive mission. Second, the roadway improvements are related to Navy initiatives associated with an increase in aircraft carrier presence to support engagement and deterrence consistent with the global shift of trade and transport. A new deep-water wharf at Apra Harbor is needed to support the increased Navy presence and port visits associated with a carrier support group. Third, the roadway improvements are related to construction of operational facilities, training, and construction of the main cantonment and family housing on Guam, and training to support the AMDTF and its defensive mission. 1.1.2 Project Purpose The purpose of the proposed construction of the GRN is to improve the existing network through the Defense Access Road (DAR) program, or other funds, and provide mission-critical transportation infrastructure as part of the planned military relocation. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">improvements</span> proposed</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> for the GRN </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">would result in strengthened roadways</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, bridge replacements, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">increased</span> roadway <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">capacity</span>, roadway <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">realignment</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> (Route 15), new access, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and</span> enhanced roadway <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">safety</span> on Guam <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">as a response to construction for</span> the military <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">relocation</span> and growth</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. 1.1.3 Project Need </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">An improved network of roads</span> on Guam <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is needed</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> as part of the mission-critical infrastructure </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to support</span> planned <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">relocation of Marines</span> and their dependents, as well as to accommodate ongoing growth on the island</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The island of </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Guam is experiencing</span> a variety of roadway problems</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">inadequate</span> bridges; flooding <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">roads</span>; poor lane visibility</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> as a result of tight corners; </span><span class="UnderlineChar">poor lane striping, lighting, and lane geometry; locations with a significant number of accidents; landslides; eroding embankments; and inadequate intersection traffic control</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The existing roadways connecting the population centers and DoD lands on Guam are shown in Figure 1.1-2. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Because <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">the existing roadway network is deficient</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">traffic problems</span> on Guam <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">would be worsened and</span> traffic <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">impacts would occur as a result of</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> the planned </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">relocation</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> of Marines and their dependents. </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Without improved roads</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and bridges, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">movement</span> of people, materials, equipment, and waste</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> associated with construction and operations </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">would result in <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">severe congestion</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> in many locations. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">If these roadway</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> and bridge </span><span class="UnderlineChar">projects are not implemented</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><span class="UnderlineChar"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the resultant wear and tear on existing roads could <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">severely limit</span> the construction schedule</span></span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">To meet these needs</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, the proposed </span><span class="UnderlineChar">GRN improvements would include roadway widening, intersection improvements</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">, bridge replacements, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">and pavement strengthening</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> at specific locations islandwide, as well as the realignment of Route 15. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">These improvements are needed to reduce traffic congestion</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> during the construction period from 2010 through 2016, with peak construction and peak population in 2014, </span><span class="UnderlineChar">and the ensuing traffic increase from full military relocation combined with projected organic growth</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. </span><span class="UnderlineChar">The transportation network should become an <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0in;">integral component</span> for fulfilling the U.S. defense strategy and alliance requirements</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">. The network would also enhance the ability of the AMDTF to defend critical military assets on Guam. The need for the proposed action is explained in further detail in Section 2.5.1. </span>
