=Contention 1 is a lack of planning= 

**Status quo planning portrays itself as scientific, but it cannot be explained without appeal to self-justifying values. This approach makes evaluation impossible by pandering to hidden ideologies.**

The theoretical and practical understanding of language …, desire and expressed want.


**Specifically, transportation infrastructure planning is represented in a desire for wholeness that can never be achieved.**
**__Gunder & Hillier ’09__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Associate Prof @ the School of Architecture and Planning @ U. of Auckland, Prof of Town and Country Planning @ School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape @ Newcastle U. (Michael and Jean, Planning in Ten Words or Less, Chapter 2: A Lack of Certainty, pg. )</span>

It is an imaginary object. Lacan's object of maternal ….constitutes the person or 'subject' as an individual in society (Verhaeghe 2001).



**This manifests through current planning’s attempt at certainty - planners try to ‘plan away’ contingency and multiplicity. As the planners create a ‘perfect world’, they structurally recreate violence. Only the aff can overcome this.**
**__Gunder & Hillier ’09__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Associate Prof @ the School of Architecture and Planning @ U. of Auckland, Prof of Town and Country Planning @ School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape @ Newcastle U. (Michael and Jean, Planning in Ten Words or Less, Chapter 2: The Lack of Certainty, pg 18-21)</span>

In Chapter 1 we have hopefully persuaded readers …prescribed orthodoxy seeking only one, or at most a few idealised, but limited, end states.



**This causes a runaway spiral, as planners project security, planning is viewed as the ‘solution’ to everything. The prescription is always ‘one more plan’ to end all our woes but this acts as the priest attempting to exorcise the specter of uncertainty, which destroys agency, causes authoritarianism, and ensures extinction.**
**__Gunder & Hillier ’09__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">– Associate Prof @ the School of Architecture and Planning @ U. of Auckland, Prof of Town and Country Planning @ School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape @ Newcastle U. (Michael and Jean, Planning in Ten Words or Less, Chapter 2: The Lack of Certainty, pg 57-61)</span>

We take the discussion of the desire for …political empowerment via their expertise and dispersal of the social definition and construction of knowledge.


**The search for certainty causes a crusade against imagined enemies, culminating in extinction** 
**__Lifton__** 19**__89__**<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> (Robert Jay, MD and renowned psychologist famous for his probing investigation into Chinese Totalistic Psychology, Updated preface to Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism, MT)</span>

Now, after twenty-eight years, my own sense of this book has changed. … ideological totalism in this book is meant to further that species orientation.



=Contention 2 is ‘how we do’= 

**Advocacy statement:** 
**As a process of becoming, Sean and I affirm the need to engage with spatial planning as a process of contingent emergence that interrogates the role of ideology in the planning process rather than the status quo’s utilization of empty signifiers to justify planning and smooth out the linear system.**

**We are a critical examination of the resolution, this has to come first – Our understanding of planning as contingent and the underpinnings of planning policy is __THE__ prior step to understand transportation as a topic. Without this planning policy is doomed to failure, the method of planning must necessarily be interrogated before policies can be evaluated.**

**Creation of new spaces is critical to the political, traditional approaches destroy politics and put us outside the law, as a violent enemy that needs extermination.**
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Swyngedouw 8</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Erik, Professor of Social and Political Geography in School of Environment and Development at University of Manchester, “Where is the political?”, 2008)</span>

The aim of this contribution is to re-centre political thought again by exploring the … equality is perverted and undermined, where the scandal of democracy erupts most violently.


**We can’t plan as if we know what infrastructure is or what it will become – only contingent planning avoids the plague of determined end-states.**
**Gunder & Hillier ’09** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">– Associate Prof @ the School of Architecture and Planning @ U. of Auckland, Prof of Town and Country Planning @ School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape @ Newcastle U. (Michael and Jean, Planning in Ten Words or Less, Chapter 10, “Beyond the Mere Rationality of Planning”, pg. 193 SW)</span>

"A key question that remains for spatial planning is whether planning theory … But, this, of course, is a different story which requires a different book!"


**Specifically, the reality of transportation is created and framed by language – it shapes policies**
**__Gunder & Hillier ’09__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Associate Prof @ the School of Architecture and Planning @ U. of Auckland, Prof of Town and Country Planning @ School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape @ Newcastle U. (Michael and Jean, Planning in Ten Words or Less, Chapter 2: The Lack of Certainty, pg 8-10)</span>

Whilst spatial planning practice may couple knowledge - scientific or otherwise -… theory and practice: communicative planning (Innes 1995).



**Their ‘facts’ are not neutral readings of reality – they are intensely ideological depictions that rely on the false conception of certainty.**
**__Gunder & Hillier ’09__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">– Associate Prof @ the School of Architecture and Planning @ U. of Auckland, Prof of Town and Country Planning @ School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape @ Newcastle U. (Michael and Jean, Planning in Ten Words or Less, Chapter 2: The Lack of Certainty, pg 65-66)</span>

This presumptive status of facts as autonomous is intensely ideological, …what resides outside the symbolic. Lacan refers to this as the Real.



**Before any other issue we are prior – political reality is only constituted by how we represent it, our framing shapes politics.**
**__Blieker__** 20**__00__**<span style="font-size: 9pt;">(Roland, Professor of IR at University of Queensland, “Contending Images of World Politics”, p. 227-228, MT)</span>

While the conceptual contours of the postmodern will always remain elusive, …one has to deal with how the representation has structured the object it seeks to represent.


=Contention 3 is Framing= 

**We shouldn’t try to turn the resolution into a ‘master plan’– questions of ‘ought’ should not be dealt with as constrained questions of ‘one’ possible solution – to do so locks in utopian ideals**
