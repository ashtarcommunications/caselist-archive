<strong>Competition is the best methodology</strong><br />

Strategists in the early nuclear era faced a fundamental challenge. How was competition possible AND also imply that interdependent dyads should be more peaceful than asymmetrically dependent dyads.<br />

<strong>No such thing as the lack and it’s impossible to determine</strong><br />
<strong>Robinson</strong> (PhD Political Theory, University of Nottingham) <strong>05</strong> (Theory and Event, Andrew, 8:1, The Political Theory of Constitutive Lack: A Critique).<br />

More precisely, I would maintain that &quot;constitutive lack&quot; is an instance of AND accused of being &quot;dangerous&quot; as to be accused of being wrong.<br />

<strong>Uniqueness matters – US has already constructed threats – the military perceives things a certain way – plan addresses proximate causes while the alt is a retreat from politics</strong><br />
<strong>Wendt 92</strong> (Alexander, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Chicago, International Organization, v46 n2)<br />
<br />
Let us assume that processes of identity- and interest-formation have created AND identities and in have become institutionalized, they are almost impossible to transform.<br />
<br />
<strong>Dissident IR -- politicization and critique reproduces sovereignty and exploitation. Only political action within international relations can break the shackles of global oppression</strong><br />
<strong>Agathangelou and Ling, 1997</strong> (Anna M., Director of the Global Change Institute in Nicosia and Former Assistant Professor of Women’s Studies and Politics at Oberlin; L.H.M., Institute of Social Studies at the Hague, Studies in Political Economy, v54, Fall, p. 7-8)<br />
<br />
Yet, ironically if not tragically, dissident IR also paralyzes itself into non- AND reconstruction, particulars from universals, and critical theory from problem-solving.<br />
<br />
<strong>Default to proximate causes – root cause theory is false</strong><br />
<strong>Sharpe 10</strong>, lecturer, philosophy and psychoanalytic studies, and Goucher, senior lecturer, literary and psychoanalytic studies – Deakin University (Matthew and Geoff, Žižek and Politics: An Introduction, p. 231 – 233)<br />
<br />
We realise that this argument, which we propose as a new ‘quilting’ framework AND today pointedly reject Theory’s legitimacy, neither reading it nor taking it seriously.<br />
<br />
<strong>Construction of threats does not cause wars</strong><br />
<strong>Kaufman 09</strong> (Stuart J, Prof Poli Sci and IR – U Delaware, “Narratives and Symbols in Violent Mobilization: The Palestinian-Israeli Case,” Security Studies 18:3, 400 – 434)<br />
<br />
Even when hostile narratives, group fears, and opportunity are strongly present, war AND and opportunity spur hostile attitudes, chauvinist mobilization, and a security dilemma.<br />
<br />
<strong>Reject alternatives that don’t specify an actor or a course of action causes 2NC shifts, can’t generate offense – also means no solvency</strong><br />
Richard Wyn <strong>Jones, 1999</strong>, “Security, Strategy, and Critical Theory,” ciao<br />
<br />
Because emancipatory political practice is central to the claims of critical theory, one might AND epistemological and methodological claims and thus that it is a fatally flawed enterprise.<br />

<strong>And, Reception-theory proves reps don’t “create reality”. Audiences are smart and reach their own conclusions.</strong><br />
