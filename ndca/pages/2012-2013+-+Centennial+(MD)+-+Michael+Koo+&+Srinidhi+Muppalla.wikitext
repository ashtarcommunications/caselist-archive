==Emory Doubles - Interrogation of Race== 
===Advocacy=== 
Centennial would like to advocate the following discussion of the topic to affirm an interrogation of power relations that questions the optimistic acceptance of substantially increasing transportation infrastructure investment by the United States

===Race=== 
White privilege is the unnamed political system that is the modern world – we are all involved in a contractual relation to the state, a racial contract that lies out the foundation of sociopolitical relations –We must aggressively engage a broader debate to situate discussions of race and challenge these assumptions
Mills Associate Prof of Philosophy @ U Illinois, Chicago 1997
Charles-; The Racial Contract; p. 1-3
White Supremacy is the unnamed political system that has made the modern world what it
AND
talk is, after all, the political lingua franca of our times.

The legacy of racism has been embedded in our transportation infrastructure – public transportation is under funded while a culture of suburbia has reinforced racial hierarchies – blacks and other minorities are trapped within the urban ghettos and unable

The transportation decision-making process ignores minorities and only benefits the wealthy, educated population

Procedural Inequity. Attention is directed to the process by which transportation decisions may or

and fare hikes have reduced access to essential social services and economic activities.

This intersects cleanly with issues of pollution—the culture of suburbia has contributed to the massive increase in carbon dioxide emissions – approaching this from a racial lens is critical to breaking down the hierarchies surrounding the suburbia culture – public transportation solves
Mandell ‘8 [4/1/08, Bekah Mandell is an A.B. from Vassar College; J.D., Boston College Law School; Director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity Fair Housing Project; Father Robert Drinan Family Fund Public Interest Fellow. “Racial Reification and Global Warming: A Truly Inconvenient Truth,” [[http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1046&context=twlj]]]

The struggle against racism will be long, difficult, without intermission, without remission

Nationally, within these racial polities, the Racial Contract manifests itself in white resistance

This is particularly true in transportation—any attempt at policy reform will fail in transportation—we must acknowledge our role as individual actors

Given the nation’s ongoing economic crises, equity is a critical lens through which we

Approaching warming without disrupting the racial framework misses the boat – any effort to just solve warming are ineffectual “market-based” approaches that prop up the racial heirarchy

The current struggle against global warming represents the invisibility of race at its finest – the environmental movement has exemplified modern color muteness and we must connect the dots between racial discrimination in warming if we are to survive

But as troubling as colorblindness can be when evinced by liberals, colormuteness may be

This discussion must happen in the debate sphere – connecting the risks of climate change to issues of social justice is critical to connect to new constituencies and create social movements towards resolving climate change
Moser and Dilling 2007 (Susanne Moser is a research scientist at the National Center
