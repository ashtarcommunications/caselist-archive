//A decade of war has focused Marines’ minds on insurgency, culture, and the permutations of modern irregular warfare, but the Nation’s greatest strategic threats lurk between the lines of economic stories from the developing world and just beyond the future years defense program…Leaders seeking to sustain growth and divert domestic discontent may choose aggressive nationalistic foreign policies if their alternatives are not properly shaped through a combination of diplomacy and deterrence.//

//Quick Victory, Deterrence, and the “Fait Accompli”…Consequently, the credibility of conventional deterrence—and execution of the threat if deterrence fails—requires convincing potential aggressors that the United States can and will rapidly respond to aggression against its global interests, and that there is nothing the regime can do to prevent or hinder the response.//

//In the current international security environment, conventional deterrence can be useful against nonnuclear and nuclear-armed adversaries…Similar to the Cold War, the deployment of conventional power in the region, combined with significant nuclear capabilities and escalation dominance, can help prevent regimes from believing that nuclear possession provides opportunities for conventional aggression and coercion.//

//Considering the requirement to gain the upper hand early in a war and the prospect of fighting a technologically superior opponent, how does the PLA propose to fight and win a high-tech local war while adhering to the strategic principle of active defense?...Thus, [the United States] is unable to establish superiority of forces and firepower, and it is easy for the U.S. military to be forced into a passive position from the start; this could very possibly have an impact on the process and outcome of the conflict.//

//As any battlefield commander will tell you, getting troops to the fight can be as difficult as winning it…"Sustain is simply an ability to move Marines very rapidly from one place to another," says Marine colonel Jack Wassink, director of the Corps's Space Integration Branch in Arlington, Virginia, where the program is based. "Space lends itself to that role."//

//When this requirement was published, the reaction of the space community, including many RLV advocates was, to put it politely, extremely skeptical…Just as similar problems on the V-22 were taken care of by advances in computer technology and engine design, a small-scale but long-term effort to take advantage of future technological progress could realistically lead to a decision to go ahead with the development of a SUSTAIN-type vehicle sometime around 2020.//

===Feminist Security K=== 
====1NC—Feminist Security K==== 
**The discourse of the 1AC relies on a masculine and securitized paradigm of military dominance. The gendered assumption built into exploration and development policies ensure insecurity and patriarchy.**
**__Griffin 9__** (Penny, Senior Lecturer - Convenor, MA International Relations, ‘The Spaces Between Us: The Gendered Politics of Outer Space’, in Bormann, N. and Sheehan, M. (eds), Securing Outer Space. London and New York: Routledge, pp.59-75.)
//The US is, of course, heavily reliant on its satellite-based systems, and to this end works (to a certain extent) within a regime framework of international space ‘law’ (Brearly, 2005: 14)…US outer space discourse is driven by the belief that outer space exists to be conquered (and that it rarely fights back), that those at the cutting edge of its exploitation are the 'visionaries' and 'entrepreneurs' that will pave the way to tourists, explorers, TV crews and to, as Morabito claims, 'dubious characters' such as, perhaps, 'bounty hunters' (2004: 10).//

**This gendered security discourse causes inevitable violence and war that turns the case. Rejecting the 1AC opens up space for a feminist reconceptualization of security.**
**__Shepherd 2007__** [Laura J., Department of Political Science and International Studies, University of Birmingham, “Victims, Perpetrators and Actors’ Revisited:1 Exploring the Potential for a Feminist Reconceptualisation of (International) Security and (Gender) Violence,” BJPIR: 2007 VOL 9, 239–256]
//As Spike Peterson and Jacqui True comment, ‘our sense of self-identity and security may seem disproportionately threatened by societal challenge to gender ordering’ (Peterson and True 1998, 17)…If this is the case, I am more than happy to be unreasonable, and I am in excellent company.//

**Framing of Gender can be a powerful cultural and political influence. These methodologies become public discourse and utilized to improve future policies. The alternative is a prior question- without it the 1AC becomes another failure of the system.**
**__Beland 09__**(Daniel, Professor of Public Policy at the University of Saskatchewan, “Gender, Ideational Analysis, and Social Policy”, Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State and Society, Volume 16, Issue 4, Project Muse, HC)
//As far as the political stream is concerned (Kingdon 1995), ideas can take the form of cultural and discursive frames that actors use to challenge or justify existing policy arrangements (e.g., Béland 2009; Campbell 1998; Schön and Rein 1994)…The issue of cultural resonance (Ferree 2003) points to the above-mentioned role of culture in policy development. Through framing processes, political actors can draw on existing cultural resources to promote—or oppose—policy change.//

====2NC—Space Leadership Link==== 
**Their focus on security and space leadership entrenches an ideology of masculinity**
**__Griffin, 03__** (Penny, Senior Lecturer - Convenor, MA International Relations, ‘The Spaces Between Us: The Gendered Politics of Outer Space’, in Bormann, N. and Sheehan, M. (eds), Securing Outer Space. London and New York: Routledge, pp.59-75.)
//The separation of a ‘public’ and ‘private’ face to the US approach to outer space is thus an important one, resulting in no small part from the political liberalism of US institutional and administrative culture. China remains, however, the only one of these ‘space powers’ to pose, in US discourse, a significant and sustained threat to US hegemony.//

==Disadvantages== 
===Politics—SKFTA=== 
====1NC—SKFTA==== 
**SKFTA will pass but PC is key – that creates a network of free-trade**
**__Reuters 9/2__**/11 (“Analysis: Obama's trade legacy in a crucible this fall”, http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/02/us-usa-obama-trade-idUSTRE7814CZ20110902)
//This month business groups expect Obama at long last to submit three Bush-era free trade pacts with South Korea, Colombia and Panama to Congress for approval… But "if the administration spends the effort and actually finishes the job (the trade deals) with Congress, that will send a very positive signal," said Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.//

**Expanding space exploration is perceived as controversial new spending -- guarantees backlash.**
**__Handberg, 11__**<span style="color: #000000;"> - Professor and Chair of the Department of Political Science at the University of Central Florida (Rodger, “Small ball or home runs: the changing ethos of US human spaceflight policy,” The Space Review, 1/17, </span>http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1759/1<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">)</span>
//The US space program remained focused, not on duplicating Apollo, but on achieving another difficult goal such as going to Mars, a logical extension truly of the Apollo effort. Twice, the presidents Bush provided the presidential rationale, if not support, for achieving great things…The home run approach has run its course at least for a time; now the small ball approach becomes your mantra.//

**Free trade provides a framework for peace – however, protectionism leads to escalating nuclear war**
**__Bernstein 10__** – an American financial theorist. He is known for his research in the field of modern portfolio theory (William J., “Debating Free Trade vs. Protectionism”, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ian-fletcher/free-trade-vs-protectioni_b_504403.html, March 18th 2010)
//"When goods are not allowed to cross borders, soldiers will." --Frederic Bastiat….So too has history repeatedly shown that even small tariff increases often lead to trade wars, and that trade wars can end in Armageddon.//

===Cooperation DA=== 
====1NC--Cooperation DA==== 
**Obama is pursuing space cooperation – US multilateral leadership is creating a framework against weaponization**
**__Huntley, 11__** – senior lecturer in the National Security Affairs department at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California [Wade, “The 2011 U.S. National Space Security Policy: Engagement as a Work in Progress”, Disarmament Times, Spring, http://disarm.igc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=429:the-2011-us-national-space-security-policy-engagement-as-a-work-in-progress&catid=154:disarmament-times-spring-2011&Itemid=2]
//As is well understood, the space policies of the Bush administration were decidedly oriented toward military security concerns and independent action. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details.//

**The perception of pursuing space dominance will destroy the commitment to the new space policy**
**__Dant, 11__** – chief of staff of the Air Force fellow and the director of space policy for the under secretary of defense for policy (Daniel, High Frontier, February, " The National Space Policy: Sustainability and Cooperation in a Congested, Competitive, and Contested Domain,” http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-110224-052.pdf)
//Cooperation for contested and competitive domain…It is now up to the Department of Defense (DoD), led by and in close coordination with the State Department via a whole of government approach, to translate our advantages in space to active leadership of the coalition of responsible space-faring nations.//

**Unilateral action alienates allies and shatters other areas of cooperation**
**__Sabathier et. al, 6__** — senior associate with the CSIS Technology and Public Policy Program and former senior fellow and director of CSIS space initiative (September 18, 2oo6 ,Vincent G. Sabathier, D.A. Broniatowski, G. Ryan Faith, Center for Strategic and International Studies, “The Case for Managed International Cooperation in Space Exploration”, http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/060918_managed_international_cooperation.pdf)
//International cooperation is valuable to a given nation in that it tends to increase political sustainability….Such a mutual decision would be significantly more tenable, in a diplomatic sense, because each party might outline a set of grievances and conditions for the termination of cooperation. Furthermore, since the agreement would be termi-nated in a spirit of mutual understanding, the possibility of future beneficial cooperation would be more likely.//

**The impact is accidental nuclear war – risks extinction.**
**__Mitchell, et al 1__** – Associate Professor of Communication and Director of Debate at the University of Pittsburgh [Dr. Gordon, ISIS Briefing on Ballistic Missile Defence, “Missile Defence: Trans-Atlantic Diplomacy at a Crossroads,” No. 6 July, http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6.html]
//A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of 'peace through strength' deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that '… the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use'….An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.//

**Space weaponization would kill heg and destroy US space leadership**
**__Hitchens, 2__** – CDI Vice President [Theresa, April 18 “Weapons in Space: Silver Bullet or Russian Roulette? The Policy Implications of U.S. Pursuit of Space-Based Weapons,” http://www.cdi.org/missile-defense/spaceweapons.cfm]
//China and Russia long have been worried about possible U.S. breakout on space-based weaponry….Spurring other nations to acquire space-based weapons of their own, especially weapons aimed at terrestrial targets, would certainly undercut the ability of U.S. forces to operate freely on the ground on a worldwide basis — negating what today is a unique advantage of being a military superpower.//

//Even though the science now confirms that human activity is contributing to global warming and that this warming is likely to continue if we do not dramatically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, we are still highly uncertain as to what the end results of this warming will be (Parry et al, 2007)….When posed with these more common scenarios we should revert back to the basic arguments for choosing the proper discount rate.//

**China’s space program is horrible**

//America is laying the groundwork for its greatest space endeavor since sending astronauts to the Moon….Furthermore, given that the rocket would carry a 130-ton payload, which is exactly the same payload weight as the super rocket demanded by certain U.S. Senators, the Chinese study is probably just a knee-jerk response to the Senators' efforts.//

====They Say: “Alternate Causes—Commercial Tourism”==== 
**Nobody will invest in commercial tourism – the technology isn’t proven**

//By far the hardest obstacle to any new rocket venture is its being properly financed….Generally, venture capitalists are concerned about the lack of management experience in new space ventures [18].//

**The EU solves the aff – they have the tech and experience**

//Europe’s space industry, to a great extent encouraged by the programmes of the European space agencies, has developed its skills across a broad swath of space technologies and systems capabilities….With the above developments, and Europe's growing expertise in autonomous atmospheric re-entry systems, Europe has all the basic building blocks to commit to even more ambitious endeavours.//
