==Harvard Round 2== 

===Contention 1: The Disaster===


====Scenario 1: Biopolitics====
Critical infrastructure is just as vulnerable as it was during Hurricane Katrina—the lack of resilience disproportionately impacts the socially vulnerable and victims of structural violence. Without the plan, Katrina will repeat itself again and again
Renne et al., 08<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> (Renne is a PhD from the University of New Orleans, Sanchez is a PhD from the University of Utah, and Litman is a director at the Victoria Transport Policy Institute (John Renne, Thomas Sanchez, and Todd Litman, "National Study on Carless and Special Needs Evacuation Planning: A Literature Review", October 2008)</span>
The objective of this study is to research how state departments of transportation (state
AND
can be understood and adopted widely (Jenkins, Laska and Williamson 2007).

Who lives and dies in a disaster is a social calculus, not just a random exception. Decades of immiseration and the undermining of disaster preparedness paved the way for mass death and institutionalized racism.
Smith 06 (Distinguished Professor of Anthropology and Geography at the CUNY Graduate Center where he also directs the Center for Place, Culture and Politics (Neil, "There~’s No Such Thing as a Natural Disaster" March 2006, http://www.ladeltacorps.org/uploads/4/3/8/1/4381788/cg-ar-packet.pdf )
It is generally accepted among environmental geographers that there is no such thing as a

are more than anything dependent on one~’s race, ethnicity and social class.

The uneven distribution of vulnerability to disaster is a new modality of racialized state terror. It is the ultimate expression of a biopolitics of disposability—certain populations are marked for death. Complicity ensures creeping fascism. 
Giroux 06<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> (Professor of English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University, previous professors at BU, Miami U, and Penn State, "Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability", JSTOR)</span>
Hurricane Katrina may have reversed the self-imposed silence of the media and public
AND
where democracy has lost its claims" (2005, 122,124).

Jesse L. **Jackson**, Jr, Congressman from the 2^^nd^^ congressional district of Illinois, Congressional Press Release September 6, **~’5**, "KATRINA AND BUSH EXPOSE FAILURE OF STATES~’ RIGHTS" p Lexis

"I couldn~’t agree more, but the problem is President Bush already has an
AND
how to build a more perfect Union into the future," Jackson concluded.



====Scenario 2: Disaster Porn====

====And the media prioritizes "newsworthiness" over truth—forming part of a hegemonic discourse that favors elite interests, likening post-Katrina New Orleans to an Iraqish war zone in which African American victims were lawless, violent, and less than human.====

Disaster reporting is also linked to what is judged to be newsworthy about particular events
AND
by emergency responders as not unlike those facing troops battling insurgents in Iraq.

====

This forces our focus to imaginary apocalyptic scenarios rather than systemic violence.====
Kathleen **Stewart**, Anthropology – UT Austin, %26 Susan Harding, Anthropology – UCSC, **~’99** (Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 28: 285-310, "BAD ENDINGS: American Apocalypsis")
Modernity is both a condition of possibility for the contemporary apocalyptic field and an example
AND
the form of dreams of love and freedom achieved and miraculous new beginnings.


====Not only does this discourse directly hinder relief efforts, but it reinforces America~’s racial divide and provides justification for the possibility of extreme future security measures taken by white America against the "enemy" of colored America====
Kathleen **Tierney**, Christine **Bevc, and** Erica **Kuligowski**, professor in the Department of Sociology and the Institute of Behavioral Science at the University of Colorado, doctoral student in sociology at the University of Colorado, and doctoral student in sociology at the University of Colorado respectively, March **~’6**, "Metaphors Matter: Disaster Myths, Media Frames, and Their Consequences in Hurricane Katrina", in The Annals of The American Academy of Political and Social Science p Lexis

Outcomes and consequences of media myths. Despite these and other efforts to criticize the
AND
likely to advocate to ensure the maintenance of public security during future emergencies?

====This makes all forms of neoliberal economic models more violent and dehumanizing.====
Henry A. **Giroux ~’6** (Chair in English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University. "Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class and the Biopolitics of Disposability")

Within a few days after Katrina struck, New Orleans was under martial law occupied
AND
economies and have instead embraced an emergent security state founded on cultural homogeneity.

====This causes ever escalating violence culminating in extinction.====
Boaventura de Sousa **Santos**, Professor of Sociology - University of Coimbra, **03**(Bad Subjects, Issue ~~%2363, April, bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html)

====Who lives and dies in a disaster is a social calculus, not just a random exception. Decades of immiseration and the undermining of disaster preparedness paved the way for mass death and institutionalized racism.====

====The uneven distribution of vulnerability to disaster is a new modality of racialized state terror. It is the ultimate expression of a biopolitics of disposability—certain populations are marked for death. Complicity ensures creeping fascism.====

====The federal government is key to disaster preparedness—arguments against infrastructural expansion boil down to sacrificing parts of the population to benefit an elite few. Vote affirmative for politically responsible federal action.====
