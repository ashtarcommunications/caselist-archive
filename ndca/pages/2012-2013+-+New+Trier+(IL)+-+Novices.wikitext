===Plan=== 
**The United States federal government should substantially increase its investment for an express train infrastructure system.**
===1AC Economy=== 
**__Contention 1 is the Economy__**
**Economic collapse now – 3 reasons**

**First, Traffic Congestion ---- HSR is key to solve highway and airport congestion which hamstrings US business and encourages offshoring – the __perception__ of the plan increases business confidence**

**Second, Competitiveness ---- US is lagging in infrastructure development**

Airport-to-airport high-speed rail also is an example of how
AND
kind of innovative thinking that must be applied to our entire transportation system.

**Third, Stimulus --- High speed rail has a multiplier effect on the economy – only the plan solves short and long term growth**

The U.S. national high-speed rail program, the largest infrastructure
AND
high-speed rail is one of the keys to realizing that goal.

===1AC Oil Dependence=== 
**__Contention 2 is Oil Dependence__**

Any debate about the future of high-speed rail must consider where this mobility
