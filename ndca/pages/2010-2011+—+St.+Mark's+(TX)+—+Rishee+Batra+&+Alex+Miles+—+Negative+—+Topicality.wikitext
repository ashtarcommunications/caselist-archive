Given its multifaceted nature, neither practitioners nor scholars have yet settled on a single definition of </span><span class="underline">presence</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Technically, the term </span><span class="underline">refers to </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">both a military posture and a military objective.

C7.10.3.12. The DoD Components shall not terminate or substantially reduce participation in joint ACAT ID programs without Requirements Authority review and USD(AT&L) approval; or in joint ACAT IA programs without Requirements Authority review and ASD(C3I) approval. The USD(AT&L) or ASD(C3I) may require a DoD Component to continue some or all funding, as necessary, to sustain the joint program in an efficient manner, despite approving their request to terminate or reduce participation. Substantial reduction is defined as a funding or quantity decrease of 50 percent or more in the total funding or quantities 
in the latest President's Budget for that portion of the joint program funded by the DoD Component seeking the termination or reduced participation.
