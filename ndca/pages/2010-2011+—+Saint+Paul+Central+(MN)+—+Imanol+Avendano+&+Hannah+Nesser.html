<strong>American Military Strategy, Throughout Afghanistan Iraq and Elsewhere is Emphasizing the Function of Electronic and Technological Surveillance—Achieving Information Dominance is a Primary Objective of Extending American Militarist Hegemony</strong><br />
ADMIRAL GARY ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS (CNO), AT THE NAVY LEAGUE OF DENVER, Defense Department Briefing, Federal News Service, August 24th, 2010 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&amp;orgId=574&amp;topicId=25098&amp;docId=l:1256043356&amp;start=22" rel="nofollow">http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&amp;orgId=574&amp;topicId=25098&amp;docId=l:1256043356&amp;start=22</a>)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And when you think about all those things going on there is no question that our Sailors today are very busy. They're busy in Iraq and Afghanistan, where we have more sailors on the ground - 14,500 Sailors serving on the ground in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Djibouti - than we have serving at sea. We have another 10,000 Sailors who are on our ships off shore and at sea we serve in a more traditional role projecting power from our aircraft carriers which continue to provide over 30% of fixed wing flying in support of U.S. and coalition troops on the ground, in Afghanistan. In July alone, that aircraft carrier that's on station in the North Arabian Sea and the strike group provided almost 1,700 sorties in one month and almost 700 hours of combat operations in support of those troops on the ground.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">But our nation's interests extend far beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, almost 40,000 Sailors are deployed and about 39% of our ships and submarines are on deployment. That is an extraordinarily high percentage. And we're delivering on our maritime strategy around the globe. Just this past month, in the vicinity of Hawaii, 14 nations, 32 ships, 5 submarines and more than 170 aircraft took part in the Rim of the Pacific exercise. And in the Mediterranean, our 6th Fleet commander on board USS Mount Whitney participated in exercises alongside the naval forces of France, Russia, and Great Britain.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> The USS George Washington, a carrier airwing, six destroyers, a fast attack submarine and maritime patrol aircraft conducted Exercise Invincible Spirit with the Republic of Korea navy. That exercise was an important one that showed our solidarity with the Republic of Korea after they had one of their ships unexpectedly torpedoed by North Korea. And in maritime security, we conducted maritime civil affairs &amp; security training in six countries across Africa, Asia, Latin America. And in humanitarian assistance and disaster response, the USS Iwo Jima supplemented by naval mobile construction forces concluded our humanitarian assistance mission in Haiti, while at the same time, USS Peleliu Amphibious Ready Group and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit are bringing flood relief to the people of Pakistan from the sea. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> And I mentioned the power projection and forward presence being provided by the Harry S. Truman tonight, as we sit here having dinner together. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> We continue to prove ourselves to be an adaptable, flexible, and fast responders, and globally we're seeing the demand for our forces continue to rise and be in greater demand than ever before. In watching developments, I remain convinced of our maritime strategy's continued relevance, and I am re-committed to the imperatives of that strategy: to prevent or to win in conflict, with the resources that it requires. Successive budgets from the fiscal year 2010 through the Navy's program submission that we've just concluded for 2012 have been consistent with that commitment to the Maritime Strategy. As was the Department of Defense's Quadrennial Defense Review or 'QDR', as was the recent Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel report that was commissioned by Congress and released late last month. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> That report reaffirmed the conclusions that we reached in our Maritime Strategy in 2007, expressing concern over a developing mismatch between force structure and our valid operational requirements. As you might be aware, that report that was just issued calls for a bigger fleet, and the floor of 313 ships that I've articulated since becoming the CNO has been encompassed in the number in that report. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> And we're also balancing our investments in ships and aircraft with systems to defeat the most challenging threats that we will face. We're building information dominance, we're building increased capacity in electronic warfare and ballistic missile defense, and intelligence, surveillance reconnaissance.</span><br />

<strong>This is Embodied in the Combat Zones that See Project, Which Attempts to Fully Comprehend and Monitor the Urban Spaces Identified as Crucial to the Future of the War on Terror—Rendering the Terrorist and Insurgent as Visible Even Within the Complicated and Diffuse Space of the City</strong><br />

<br />
A particularly interesting project embracing the ideas of the DSB report is the tellingly titled ‘Combat Zones That See’ (CTS) project set up by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Launched at the start of the Iraq insurgency in 2003, CTS ‘explores concepts, develops algorithms, and delivers systems for utilising large numbers (1000s) of algorithmic video cameras to provide the close-in sensing demanded for military operations in urban terrain’ (DARPA 2003, p. 4). Through installing computerized CCTV across whole occupied cities, the project organisers envisage that, when deployed, CTS will sustain ‘motion-pattern analysis across whole city scales’, linked to the tracking of massive populations of individualized cars and people through intelligent computer algorithms linked to the recognition of number plates and scanned in human facial photos to provide ‘close-in, continuous, alwayson support for military operations in urban terrain’ (DARPA 2003, p. 6). The work of the DSB is just one example of a vast complex of research and development driven by the apparent inability of Western militaries and police security agencies to actually identify, track and locate their ‘targets’ within a globalizing and urbanizing ‘battlespace’ where any simple separation of the home city from the hostile one breaks down. Crucial to these emerging surveillance systems is a radically new politics of anticipatory seeing. For the overarching feature of the new, militarized, surveillance push, whether its ‘targets’ are located in Manhattan and Baghdad, London and Fallujah, is an attempt to build systems of technological vision in which computer code itself is, along with databases of real or imaged ‘targets’, delegated with the agency of tracking and identifying ‘abnormal’ ‘targets’ from the background ‘normality’ of a homeland or war-zone city. Crucial here is the adaptation of the commercial practices of ‘data mining’ or ‘predictive analytics’ where algorithms are developed to look for patterns in the swathes of captured data, identify or profile behaviours or characteristics deemed to be ‘unusual’ or ‘abnormal’, and search for ‘target’ people, transactions or flows deemed to have such characteristics (see McCue 2005; Pruett 2005). Jordan Crandall suggests that ‘tracking is integral’ to emerging modes of governance and military power based on ‘anticipatory seeing’ (1999). The key question now, he suggests, is ‘how targets are identified and distinguished from non-targets’ within ‘decision making and killing’ (1999). Identifying such targets becomes the role of statistical algorithms which sift the mass and flux of registered and sensed data searching for (what Mark Seltzer has termed) ‘statistical persons’. Most important here is that all potential ‘targets’ must be incorporated into databases in the first place. Indeed, the existence of a signature in a database increasingly defines citizenship in this new age: ‘frequently . . . there is no person who exists outside of the database’ (Crandall 1999). To Crandall, this widespread integration of computerized tracking with databases of ‘targets’ represents little but ‘a gradual colonization of the now, a now always slightly ahead of itself’ (Crandall 1999). This shift represents a process of profound militarization because the social identification of people within civilian law enforcement is complemented or even replaced by the ‘machinic’ seeing of ‘targets’. ‘While civilian images are embedded in processes of identification based on reflection’, writes Crandall, ‘militarised perspectives collapse identification processes into “Id-ing” – one-way channel of identification in which a conduit, a database, and a body are aligned and calibrated’ (Crandall 1999). Again, this is central to the relationship between the application of identical surveillance systems in both homeland and war zone securitization. Crandall suggest that the new capacity of anticipatory seeing involves a kind of ‘armed vision’ where the capabilities of vision are ‘upgraded and made safe against an unprocessed exteriority, a dangerous and unreliable outside’ (Crandall 1999).<br />

<strong>The Already Widespread Deployment of These Systems Enables Hegemonic Violence to Be Unleashed in Even the Most Opaque of Arenas and Make the Terrorist a Destroyable Object</strong><br />

<br />
A second key theme in discussions about the reconfiguration of urban spaces through ubiquitous computing centres on imperatives of securitization. In particular, the imagination, development and deployment of myriads of new sensing and surveillance systems in city spaces are at the heart of efforts within the so-called ‘war on terror’ to both securitize Western or ‘homeland’ cities and to counter insurgencies within war-zone cities in the colonized frontiers of the global South. In both domains, the key dynamic centres on attempts at rendering complex urban flows and structures permanently transparent to tracking and surveillance systems. In military jargon, cities and the complex infrastructure grids within and between them are now deemed to be the central ‘battlespaces’ in which terrorists and insurgents are largely indistinguishable from the wider urban background and thus cannot be easily identified, tracked, or targeted. ‘Identity dominance’ in ‘asymmetric warfare’ The key to this new type of conflict, which profoundly embeds the new ‘battlespaces’ in urban civilian life, is to mobilize ambient intelligence. Embedded in cities and urban infrastructures, to provide the ‘battlespace awareness’ necessary to identify, track and target lurking insurgents, terrorists and other ‘targets’, and so provide Western forces with what John Woodward, of RAND’s Intelligence Policy Centre, calls ‘Identity dominance’ (McCue 2005). Thus, military, defence and surveillance industries are offering ambient technologies such as RFID tags, algorithmic video cameras, data mining and biometrics as means to unveil the logistical, transactional and geographical movements of the human and non-human ‘targets’ of the war on terror. Prototype pervasive processors called ‘Smart dust’ were released in 2001, they were powered by solar energy and able to communicate about the environment they found themselves in, from San Francisco to Berkeley even if, at 7 mm in length, they were not (yet) wind blown as intended (McCullough 2004, p. 73). This is being done in a context where the complexity, density, dynamism and scale of urban centres are widely deemed by US defence analysts to undermine the high-technology advantages of Western state militaries. The new military focus is on informal, non-state terrorists and insurgents who blend into the background of the cities, city networks, and urban infrastructure systems they both choose as the bases for their actions, and exploit in their targeting operations. An excellent example of the ways in which ambient intelligence technologies are being portrayed as central mechanisms through which to wage the ‘war on terror’ comes from a major report published by the Pentagon’s Defense Science Board (DSB) in December 2004. One of many attempting to draw early military lessons from the urban insurgency in Iraq, this report was startling for one reason. It deliberately called for what it termed a ‘New Manhattan Project’, invoking the code-name famously used in the 1940s to describe the massive programme which developed the first atom bombs used to devastate Hiroshima and Nagasaki in May 1945 It urged a similar concentration of military resources on what the Board saw as the key strategic priority for the twenty-first century: the technological unveiling of cities and urban life. Specifically, it saw possibilities to exploit ubiquitous computing technologies in developing a massive, integrated system of surveillance, spanning the world, and tailored specifically to penetrating the increasing complexity of urban life. Such a system, it argued, would once again render the US military’s targets trackable, locatable – and destroyable. The purpose of the New ‘Manhattan project’, then, was seen to be to ‘locate, identify, and track, people, things and activities – in an environment of one in a million – to give the United States the same advantages in asymmetric warfare [as] it has today in conventional warfare’ (DSB 2004, p. 163). Strategically, the ideas of the report have been cemented as one of eight principle development areas into the New Pentagon strategy for a ‘Long War issued in 2005’. The United States’ hegemonic capabilities for surveillance over the earth from the distant, vertical domains of air and space were deemed by the DSB to have ‘poor capability for finding, identifying and tracking’ what it calls ‘unconventional war targets’ (DSB 2004, p. 153) such as ‘individuals and insurgent or terrorists groups that operate by blending in with the larger Crucially, intimate and persistent military surveillance systems were needed which penetrated the details of everyday urban life. As the report put it, little less than a comprehensive rescaling of military imaginations of surveillance was needed and ‘more intimate, terrestrial, 21st century ISR [Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] were required’ (DSB 2004, p. 2). The gaze of hegemonic military power, the report argued, thus needed to colonize not just the planetary scales of surveillance; it also needed to penetrate the fine-grained and local geographies of urban and infrastructural ‘battlespaces’. Such a transformation was imagined to be profoundly temporal as well as geographical. ‘The surveillance of people, things and activities required to populate the databases needed for identification, location and tracking’, the authors write, ‘will require a persistence beyond that typical of many of today’s’ military and security surveillance systems. These new surveillance systems, profoundly local and global at the same time, will, in other words, need to be ‘always on’. This will allow them, through ‘evidence-correlating and backtracking algorithms’ (DSB 2004, p. 159) to call upon memories, via databases recording the history of movements and associations of things, activities and people, and anticipate, so that threatening and ‘abnormal’ behaviours and emergences can be detected and dealt with before the point of terrorist or insurgent attack. The new ‘Close-in, terrestrial means’ of surveillance, intelligence and targeting centre on the ‘data mining’ and tracking techniques familiar from the commercial aspirations. To achieve this, biometric sensors will need to verify and code people’s identities, as they flow through national or other borders, through finger/palm prints; iris scans; DNA; face recognition; voice recognition; even odour and gait recognition (Figure 3). (The DSB report favours combinations of iris and fingerprint scans, combined with face recognition, as ‘offering a reasonably effective compromise among speed, accuracy, ease of implementation and cost’ (DSB 2004, p. 159)). A wide range of technologies deploying algorithmic calculation, tracking and data mining are being deployed to reconfigure passport systems, borders, even public transport transactions, based on the biometric tracking of identities. All of these centre on combinations of data mining, riskprofiling, attempts at pre-empting risk, and identifying purported ‘targets through what Louise Amoore has called ‘war-like architectures of self/other’ (Amoore 2007, p. 1). They will also connect objects and itineraries into blogjects, storing data on who comes into contact with what and when. On the ground, biometric means of bordering, population control and incarceration have been widely employed in Iraq, notably in the city of Fallujah (where all remaining residents have been given ID cards embedding both fingerprints and retina scans which must be used to pass through fences and checkpoints encircling the town). Meanwhile, new projects titled ‘Transparent Urban Structures’ and the ‘Visibuilding’ programme have been funded which seek to build sensors that automatically penetrate the built fabric of cities.<br />

<strong>The Strategy of Ensuring Visibility is in Itself the Primary form of Control and Submission to Disciplinary Power—By Forcing the Subject into the Visible Everyone is Made Accountable and Ultimately Imprisoned Within Themselves—This Visibility is the Basis of All Manifestations of Power and the Implementation of Violence</strong><br />
Neve Gordon, Department of Politics and Government, Ben-Gurion University, “On Visibility and Power: An Arendtian Corrective of Foucault,” Human Studies, Spring 2002 (Jstor)<br />
<br />
Foucault's emphasis on surveillance as one of the most efficacious controlling techniques within disciplinary society has highlighted the central role of visibility in his understanding of power and control. We read that due &quot;to the techniques of surveillance, the 'physics' of power, the hold over the body, operate according to the laws of optics and mechanics, according to a whole play of spaces, lines, screens, beams, degrees, and without recourse, in principle, at least, to excess, force or violence. It is a power that seems all the less 'corporeal' in that it is subtly 'physical'&quot; (Foucault 1979, p. 177). Elsewhere he states, &quot;There is no need for arms, physical violence, material constraints. Just a gaze. An inspecting gaze, a gaze which each individual under its weight will end by interiorising to the point that he is his own overseer, each individual thus exercising this surveillance over, and against himself (1980, p. 155). It is as if the &quot;gaze&quot; penetrates the individual, helping to shape the &quot;soul&quot; so that it conform to the existing rules, codes, and mores. The soul, Foucault concludes, becomes the prison of the body. The importance of visibility is frequently mentioned vis-a-vis Foucault's discussion of Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon. The invariable visibility of the<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">prisoner enforces isolation, which is, according to the prison authorities, a boon. From the point of view of the guard, the inmate population is &quot;replaced by a multiplicity that can be numbered and supervised; from the point of view of the inmates, by a sequestered and observed solitude&quot; (1979, p. 201). One notices that Foucault draws a line between visibility and isolation, arguing that above all other techniques, the isolation created by permanent visibility enables the exercise of a maximum intensity of power over prisoners. Indeed, &quot;solitude is the primary condition of total submission. . .&quot; (1979, p. 237).7 No other influence can overthrow this power because no viable alternative can be organized in isolation, and when no alternative can be organized then submission becomes the only tenable course of action.8 The flaw of the panoptic model, as C. Colwell points out, is that the gaze is centralized, while power, according to Foucault, is not located in one identifiable site (Colwell, 1994). I would argue that the cubicle, a more recent disciplinary artifact, might serve as a more &quot;exact&quot; model of Foucauldian power. &quot;Budgetary constraints&quot; have led corporations to shunt employees, who previously worked in individual offices, into a central space divided by cubicles.9 The cheaper materials from which the cubicle is made and the diminished space it occupies are not the only reasons cubicles have become permanent fixtures in the corporate landscape. In many respects, the latent power of the their ingenious design is a perfect example of a structure created to ensure invariable control over its occupier - the white-collar corporate worker. Cubicles have no doors, and the desk is often situated across from the opening so that the worker's back is facing the public maze. The thin &quot;walls&quot; never reach the ceiling, even though they are at times too high for someone to look over. The worker is never sure who might pass by the open entrance or whether someone is listening-in on a phone conversation. Similar to the panopticon, the perpetual visibility of the employee is sufficient to render most workers docile. With cubicles, there is no identifiable site of control: no boss stands at the door to secure compliance; no executive continually inspects one's work. No monitor is needed. The mere possibility that a person from a higher echelon or even a co-worker will overhear a discussion or notice an employee resting is sufficient to ensure that the corporation's standards, customs, restrictions, and prohibitions are observed. This novel arrangement of the workplace is designed to guarantee the compliant diligence of employees. Furthermore, there is often no common space in which a group of workers can meet spontaneously or private space where co-workers can have confidential discussions. The cubicle phenomenon signifies that the white collar worker too has been colonized by Taylorism, confirming Foucault's claim that a &quot;cleverly&quot; designed edifice has the capacity to increase the productivity of a worker in terms of economic utility, while diminishing the political astuteness and individuality of that worker (Foucault, 1979, p. 138).10</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> In Discipline and Punish, Foucault stresses that visibility is not only attained through architectural devices. He also mentions the process of examination, another form of control that has proliferated in the past century. The use of examination is pervasive, and one encounters it in a variety of forms throughout life.11 Its capacity to facilitate social control is twofold, in both cases, though, it makes the subject visible in order to control him or her. On the one hand, it constantly sifts the members of society through a strainer, making them visible in order to evaluate and categorize them according to established criteria. Those who deviate can be sent to prisons or psychiatric institutions, while the rest are further categorized and compartmentalized according to their particular &quot;abilities.&quot; In this way, the examination distinguishes, divides, and ultimately isolates the different members of society. On the other hand, in order to succeed in passing the examination, individuals are required to appropriate an already determined field of knowledge and behavior. If one wishes, for example, to be a teller in a bank, there are a whole range of conditions one needs to satisfy. One has to demonstrate-that is, make visible-one's ability to calculate and be mindful of money; one has to show that one can comply with a dress code, adopt certain mannerisms, and appropriate the accepted business proprieties. Foucault mentions the use of exams in educational institutions. Students are constantly requested to take tests or hand in papers, which the teacher uses in order to evaluate their progress and accomplishments. The examination, Foucault explains, enables the teacher to establish a &quot;visibility through which one differentiates [the students] and judges them&quot; ( 1979, p. 184); each individual &quot;receives as his status his own individuality,&quot; thus marking the pupil as a case (1979, p. 192). Insofar as the examination is a reflection of the student, the student is also conceived of as an object. While the examination, like other forms of surveillance, is a mechanism that differentiates and insulates, it also homogenizes since it allows the teacher to transmit specific information and &quot;to transform his pupils into a whole field of knowledge&quot; (1979, p. 186). Foucault argues that the employment of visibility has changed over time. Indeed, the individuation and isolation of the subject occurred only with the introduction of disciplinary techniques, because these techniques reversed the visibility of power. Traditionally, power which was embodied in the sovereign-was visible whereas the subject remained hidden. It was only the occasional reflection of sovereign power on the subject?e.g., when a subject was accused of some kind of offence and tortured in the town square that positioned the individual under the limelight. Disciplinary power inverted this strategy. As opposed to sovereign power and judiciary power, which operate by virtue of their visibility, disciplinary power is exercised through its invisibility. The disciplinary techniques impose &quot;on those whom it subjects a principle of compulsory visibility&quot; (Foucault, 1979, p. 187). Thus, in contrast to sovereign power, the introduction of discipline forced the subjects to come into view, since their visibility assures the hold of the power exercised over them. More generally, Foucault shows how the mode of visibility changes over time according to the operation of power. As stressed through the examples of the panoptic tower and the cubicle, it is the potential of being constantly seen that &quot;maintains the disciplined individual in his subjection&quot; (Foucault, 1979, p. 187). While visibility has usually been discussed in relation to surveillance and, more broadly, disciplinary techniques, it is important to point out that visibility in the sense of being seen and heardis also a crucial component of all other forms of power discussed by Foucault. Visibility is essential to power not only because it is put to use by power in order to control people, but perhaps more importantly because it is power's condition of possibility. Discursive practices, for instance, are meaningless and powerless if they are not visible. Judith Butler makes this point clear in her discussion of gender performativity. She shows how the process of signification occurs through the constant performative reiteration of norms, and this reiteration actually materializes a set of effects on the matter of bodies (Butler, 1990, 1993). Visibility, accordingly, precedes the process of internalization. Put differently, discursive practices are actually created, reproduced, and upheld through visible citation and repetition of their normative fiats. Conversely, if a discursive practice ceases to be articulated by constant repetition, it loses its power and may eventually disappear. Thus, the practice maintains its power only insofar as it is visible. One notices that visibility functions as a form of control in two distinct ways. On the one hand, the actual visibility of normative fiats is necessary for them to maintain their power over the subject. While on the other hand, the invariable potential visibility of the subject is sufficient to render him/her docile. These modes of visibility are only methodologically distinct, since the subject's potential visibility is intricately tied to the actual visibility of normative fiats. In other words, the subject's potential visibility facilitates control only because a set of normative fiats is already visibly circulating in society and the subject must, in some way, relate to these fiats. Along the same lines, the visibility of normative fiats necessarily affects the subject only because she/he is always potentially visible.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A universal feature of both urban RMA discourses, and popular cultural renditions of Arab cities in video games and the like, is the reduction of global south cities to physical, uninhabited spaces whose very geographies are essentialised as a geopolitical risk to the verticalised power of the US military. Such discourses directly lead to the dehumanisation of the citizens of these cities within the hyper-militarised rhetoric which dominates the US military, a process which, in turn, renders their lives, deaths, and citizenship of no account. For, in trying to render Orientalised cityscapes transparent to the both algorithmic gaze of Western military technoscience, and the immersed, voyeuristic gaze of the video game player, the inhabitants and social worlds of Arab and global south cities simultaneously become invisible. ‘Cities’ are reduced to pure ‘battlespace’. Urban inhabitants become ‘targets’ to be tracked, surveilled and, if necessary, targeted with weapons. And notions of the civilian are increasingly rendered meaningless within wider discussions about how 'assymetric’, ‘network-centric’ or ‘unrestricted’ warfare means that all bodies, everywhere, must be treated, a priori, as adversaries (Gregory, 2006).</span><br />
Second, I would argue that the ‘urban’ turn in the RMA involves an important rescaling process in the geographical and geopolitical imaginaries of Western military and visual culture. Instead of rendering the globe as a single, integrated ‘battlespace’ to be controlled through the real-time systems of ‘network centric’ warfare -- as was typical in the first generation of RMA discussions -- military planners address instead the microgeographical landscapes of streets, buildings, tunnels, and cities. The world of the city once again becomes a dominant site within Western geopolitical and military imaginaries. Heralding the possibility of a new relationship between warfare, technoscience and the organisation of space, these encounters bring with them a highly charged politics of seeing – a geopolitics of exposure and (in)visibility. But such a politics moves far beyond traditional questions of the human gaze and the representation and imagination of geographies within various media that have long dominated Orientalist constructions of Arab cities within Western colonial history. As well as these, it forces the consideration of what Jordan Crandall (2005, 5) calls the “tracking-gaze” and how the social matrix of anticipatory seeing, with computer algorithms as key agents, brings with it a new geopolitics of visuality. To Crandall, this complex of militaristic tracking technologies “moves away from a focus on perspective and position to one of movement-flow”(2005, 5). It “is a convenience- and security-driven network ontology that requires its own threatening other” (2005, 5). And it brings with it a post-optical politics of (attempted) control and subordination which is now being closely inscribed into both the imaginary and real geographies of Western military incursions in the rapidly urbanising global south.<br />

<strong>The Creation and Sustenance of American Hegemony Based on These Orientlalist Perceptions Ensures Exclusion, Genocide and Annihilation</strong><br />
Pinar Batur, Professor of Scociology at Vassar, The Heart of Violence: Global Racism, War, and Genocide,” in Handbook of the The Soiology of Racial and Ethnic Relations, eds. Vera and Feagin 2007 [“, p. 446-7]<br />
<br />
At the turn of the 20th century, the “Terrible Turk” was the image that summarized the enemy of Europe and the antagonism toward the hegemon<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">y of the Ottoman Empire, stretching from Europe to the Middle East, and across North Africa. Perpetuation of this imagery in American foreign policy exhibited how capitalism met with orientalist constructs in the white racial frame of the western mind (VanderLippe 1999). Orientalism is based on the conceptualization of the “Oriental” other—Eastern, Islamic societies as static, irrational, savage, fanatical, and inferior to the peaceful, rational, scientific “Occidental” Europe and the West (Said 1978). This is as an elastic construct, proving useful to describe whatever is considered as the latest threat to Western economic expansion, political and cultural hegemony, and global domination for exploitation and absorption.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Post-Enlightenment Europe and later America used this iconography to define basic racist assumptions regarding their uncontestable right to impose political and economic dominance globally. When the Soviet Union existed as an opposing power, the orientalist vision of the 20th century shifted from the image of the “Terrible Turk” to that of the “Barbaric Russian Bear.” In this context, orientalist thought then, as now, set the terms of exclusion. It racialized exclusion to define the terms of racial privilege and superiority. By focusing on ideology, orientalism recreated the superior race, even though there was no “race.” It equated the hegemony of Western civilization with the “right ideological and cultural framework.” It segued into war and annihilation and genocide and continued to foster and aid the recreation of racial hatred of others with the collapse of the Soviet “other.” Orientalism’s global racist ideology reformed in the 1990s with Muslims and Islamic culture as to the “inferior other.” Seeing Muslims as opponents of Christian civilization is not new, going back to the Crusades, but the elasticity and reframing of this exclusion is evident in recent debates regarding Islam in the West, one raised by the Pope and the other by the President of the United States.</span><br />
Against the background of the latest Iraq war, attacks in the name of Islam, racist attacks on Muslims in Europe and in the United States, and detention of Muslims without trial in secret prisons, Pope Benedict XVI gave a speech in September 2006 at Regensburg University in Germany. He quoted a 14th-century Byzantine emperor who said, “show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.” In addition, the Pope discussed the concept of Jihad, which he defined as Islamic “holy war,” and said, “violence in the name of religion was contrary to God’s nature and to reason.” He also called for dialogue between cultures and religions (Fisher 2006b). While some Muslims found the Pope’s speech “regrettable,” it also caused a spark of angry protests against the Pope’s “ill informed and bigoted” comments, and voices raised to demand an apology (Fisher 2006a). Some argue that the Pope was ordering a new crusade, for Christian civilization to conquer terrible and savage Islam. When Benedict apologized, organizations and parliaments demanded a retraction and apology from the Pope and the Vatican (Lee 2006). Yet, when the Pope apologized, it came as a second insult, because in his apology he said, “I’m deeply sorry for the reaction in some countries to a few passages of my address at the University of Regensburg, which were considered offensive to the sensibilities of Muslims” (Reuters 2006). In other words, he is sorry that Muslims are intolerant to the point of fanaticism. In the racialized world, the Pope’s apology came as an effort to show justification for his speech—he was not apologizing for being insulting, but rather saying that he was sorry that “Muslim” violence had proved his point.<br />
Through orientalist and the white racial frame, those who are subject to racial hatred and exclusion themselves become agents of racist legitimization. Like Huntington, Bernard Lewis was looking for Armageddon in his Wall Street Journal article warning that August 22, 2006, was the 27th day of the month of Rajab in the Islamic calendar and is considered a holy day, when Muhammad was taken to heaven and returned. For Muslims this day is a day of rejoicing and celebration. But for Lewis, Professor Emeritus at Princeton, “this might well be deemed an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of Israel and, if necessary, of the world” (Lewis 2006). He cautions that “it is far from certain that [the President of Iran] Mr. Ahmadinejad plans any such cataclysmic events for August 22, but it would be wise to bear the possibility in mind.” Lewis argues that Muslims, unlike others, seek self-destruction in order to reach heaven faster. For Lewis, Muslims in this mindset don’t see the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction as a constraint but rather as “an inducement” (Lewis 2006). In 1993, Huntington pleaded that “in a world of different civilizations, each . . .will have to learn to coexist with the others” (Huntington 1993:49). Lewis, like Pope Benedict, views Islam as the apocalyptic destroyer of civilization and claims that reactions against orientalist, racist visions such as his actually prove the validity of his position.<br />
Lewis’s assertions run parallel with George Bush’s claims. In response to the alleged plot to blow up British airliners, Bush claimed, “This nation is at war with Islamic fascists who will use any means to destroy those of us who love freedom, to hurt our nation” (TurkishPress.com. 2006; Beck 2006). Bush argued that “the fight against terrorism is the ideological struggle of the 21st century” and he compared it to the 20th century’s fight against fascism, Nazism, and communism. Even though “Islamo-fascist” has for some time been a buzzword for Bill O’Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, and Sean Hannity on the talk-show circuit, for the president of the United States it drew reactions worldwide. Muslim Americans found this phrase “contributing to the rising level of hostility to Islam and the American Muslim community” (Raum 2006). Considering that since 2001, Bush has had a tendency to equate “war on terrorism” with “crusade,” this new rhetoric equates ideology with religion and reinforces the worldview of a war of civilizations. As Bush said, “ we still aren’t completely safe, because there are people that still plot and people who want to harm us for what we believe in” (CNN 2006).<br />
Exclusion in physical space is only matched by exclusion in the imagination, and racialized exclusion has an internal logic leading to the annihilation of the excluded. Annihilation, in this sense, is not only designed to maintain the terms of racial inequality, both ideologically and physically, but is institutionalized with the vocabulary of self-protection. Even though the terms of exclusion are never complete, genocide is the definitive point in the exclusionary racial ideology, and such is the logic of the outcome of the exclusionary process, that it can conclude only in ultimate domination. War and genocide take place with compliant efficiency to serve the global racist ideology with dizzying frequency. The 21st century opened up with genocide, in Darfur.<br />

<strong>The Drive to Unite Technology in an Overwhelming Sweep of Information is the Ultimate Strategy of the Permanent State of Exception, the Creation of a Biopolitical Regime of Safety and Security</strong><br />
Jeremy Packer, Associate Professor in the Department of Communication and the Director of the Communication, Rhetoric, and Digital Media PhD Program, “BECOMING BOMBS: MOBILIZING MOBILITY IN THE WAR OF TERROR,” July, 2006 (Ebscohost)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">These new formulations draw from those derived of previous problematizations of mobility. The technologies of governance present in the not so distant past have surely been ramped up, but they are not wholly new. As the head of Technology and Public Policy Program for the Center for Strategic and International Studies states (Lewis cited in Shachtman 2003) in reference to the most far-reaching of these new technologies, Combat Zones that See (CTS), ‘it’s just connecting things that already exist’. In fact, the very technologies used under the guidance of what I call the automobility safety regime (Packer 2003); have been applied extensively in this new security regime. Yet, it is partially the availability of such technologies that makes for their easy application. David Lyon (2003) makes evident that such new applications have been widespread in the U.S’s war on terror. Homeland Security in this regard is a new use of old tools; a governmental and corporate game of shifting resources and expenditures from one profitable arena to an even more profitable one. But, it is also much more than that. The logic of automotive safety has worked part and parcel with a biopolitical formation of disciplinarity and control. Safety as a set of practices and a legitimizing discourse has been both a goal of biopolitics and a means for ensuring discipline and implementing a control society. More specifically it is one means for ‘governing at a distance’; that is, organizing, regulating, and making productive the mobility of individuals and the population alike without direct governmental control.3 In other words, the goals of ensuring the safety of an auto-mobile population and the efficiency of the automobile system demands that driving subjects become highly normalized and self-disciplined.</span><br />
The goals of national security are now imagined as depending upon the same disciplinary and control technologies that have proven effective in both increasing automotive safety and in legitimating and extending the very possibilities for a control society. To make clear, Homeland Security is not simply a means for creating the conditions for the safe existence of citizens or for guaranteeing the security of the nation. It is also a means for further implementing what Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri (2001, p. 38) have termed Empire which is ‘based on a state of permanent exception and police action’. Such a state of exception turns all terrain, including the Homeland, into a battlefield and all traversing it become actionable forces for police/ military use or intervention. Previously the logic of safety was used as the moral cause by which the activation of a control society had come about in the realm of personalized transport. And under such conditions the stated role of the police was to help save lives by enforcing rules of vehicular conduct. Under current conditions attempts for achieving the control society _ as described by<br />
Gilles Deleuze (1995) and later articulated as the primary mechanism of power for Empire (Hardt and Negri 2001) _ are animated in regards to mobility via security concerns. What follows is (1) an examination of how the logics of safety and security differ, specifically as they relate to mobility and (2) an investigation of how these logics are activated through a particular mode of mobility, the automobile. This essay then examines these fundamental changes through a historical and theoretical analysis of how the control society has been operating in relation to automobility; changes that it is argued are experiments ultimately for controlling all forms of human mobility.<br />

<strong>The Biopolitics of Exception and Visibility Makes Violence Inevitable—The Rise of the Camp is Intimately Connected With the Attempt to Render Populations Expendable and Disposable</strong><br />
Henry Giroux, Prof at McMaster, “Reading Hurricane Katrina:Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability,” College Literature, 2006<br />
<br />
In the current historical moment, as Catherine Mills points out, &quot;all subjects are at least potentially if not actually abandoned by the law and exposed to violence as a constitutive condition of political existence&quot; (2004, 47). Nicholas Mirzoeff has observed that all over the world there is a growing resentment of immigrants and refugees, matched by the emergence of detain-and-deport strategies and coupled with the rise of the camp as the key institution and social model of the new millennium. The &quot;empire of camps,&quot; according to Mirzoeff, has become the &quot;exemplary institution of a system of global capitalism that supports the West in its high consumption, low-price consumer lifestyle&quot; (2005, 145). Zygmunt Bauman calls such camps &quot;garrisons of extraterritoriality&quot; and argues that they have become &quot;the dumping grounds for the indisposed of and as yet unrecycled waste of the global frontier-land&quot; (2003, 109). The regime of the camp has increasingly become a key index of modernity and the new world order. The connections among disposability, violence, and death have become common under modernity in those countries where the order of power has become necropolitical. For example, Rosa Linda Fregoso analyzes feminicide as a local expression of global violence against women in the region of the U.S./Mexico border where over one thousand women have been either murdered or disappeared, constituting what amounts to a &quot;politics of gender extermination&quot; (2006, 109). The politics of disposability and necropolitics not only generate widespread violence and ever expanding &quot;garrisons of extraterritoriality&quot; but also have taken on a powerful new significance as a foundation for political sovereignty. Biopolitical commitments to &quot;let die&quot; by abandoning citizens appear increasingly credible in light of the growing authoritarianism in the United States under the Bush administration (Giroux 2005). [End Page 180]<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Given the Bush administration's use of illegal wiretaps, the holding of &quot;detainees&quot; illegally and indefinitely in prisons such as Guantanamo, the disappearance, kidnapping, and torture of alleged terrorists, and the ongoing suspension of civil liberties in the United States, Agamben's theory of biopolitics rightly alerts us to the dangers of a government in which the state of emergency becomes the fundamental structure of control over populations. While Agamben's claim that the concentration camp (as opposed to Foucault's panopticon) is now the model for constitutional states captures the contrariness of biopolitical commitments that have less to do with preserving life than with reproducing violence and death, its totalitarian logic is too narrow and fails in the end to recognize that the threat of violence, bare life, and death is not the only form of biopower in contemporary life. The dialectics of life and death, visibility and invisibility, and privilege and lack in social existence that now constitute the biopolitics of modernity have to be understood in terms of their complexities, specificities, and diverse social formations. For instance, the diverse ways in which the current articulation of biopower in the United States works to render some groups disposable and to privilege others within a permanent state of emergency need to be specified. Indeed, any viable rendering of contemporary biopolitics must address more specifically how biopower attempts not just to produce and control life in general, as Hardt and Negri insist, or to reduce all inhabitants of the increasing militarized state to the dystopian space of the &quot;death camp,&quot; as Agamben argues, but also to privilege some lives over others. The ongoing tragedy of pain and suffering wrought by the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina reveals a biopolitical agenda in which the logic of disposability and the politics of death are inscribed differently in the order of contemporary power—structured largely around wretched and broad-based racial and class inequalities.</span><br />
I want to further this position by arguing that neoliberalism, privatization, and militarism have become the dominant biopolitics of the mid-twentieth-century social state and that the coupling of a market fundamentalism and contemporary forms of subjugation of life to the power of capital accumulation, violence, and disposability, especially under the Bush administration, has produced a new and dangerous version of biopolitics.4 While the murder of Emmett Till suggests that a biopolitics structured around the intersection of race and class inequalities, on the one hand, and state violence, on the other, has long existed, the new version of biopolitics adds a distinctively different and more dangerous register. The new biopolitics not only includes state-sanctioned violence but also relegates entire populations to spaces of invisibility and disposability. As William DiFazio points out, &quot;the state has been so weakened over decades of privatization that it . . . increasingly [End Page 181] fails to provide health care, housing, retirement benefits and education to a massive percentage of its population&quot; (2006, 87). While the social contract has been suspended in varying degrees since the 1970s, under the Bush Administration it has been virtually abandoned. Under such circumstances, the state no longer feels obligated to take measures that prevent hardship, suffering, and death. The state no longer protects its own disadvantaged citizens—they are already seen as dead within a transnational economic and political framework. Specific populations now occupy a globalized space of ruthless politics in which the categories of &quot;citizen&quot; and &quot;democratic representation,&quot; once integral to national politics, are no longer recognized. In the past, people who were marginalized by class and race could at least expect a modicum of support from the government, either because of the persistence of a drastically reduced social contract or because they still had some value as part of a reserve army of unemployed labour. That is no longer true. This new form of biopolitics is conditioned by a permanent state of class and racial exception in which &quot;vast populations are subject to conditions of life conferring upon them the status of living dead&quot; (Mbembe 2003, 40), largely invisible in the global media, or, when disruptively present, defined as redundant, pathological, and dangerous. Within this wasteland of death and disposability, whole populations are relegated to what Zygmunt Bauman calls &quot;social homelessness&quot; (2004, 13). While the rich and middle classes in the United States maintain lifestyles produced through vast inequalities of symbolic and material capital, the &quot;free market&quot; provides neither social protection and security nor hope to those who are poor, sick, elderly, and marginalized by race and class. Given the increasing perilous state of the those who are poor and dispossessed in America, it is crucial to reexamine how biopower functions within global neoliberalism and the simultaneous rise of security states organized around cultural (and racial) homogeneity. This task is made all the more urgent by the destruction, politics, and death that followed Hurricane Katrina.<br />

<strong>These Status Quo Fantasies of Perfect Omniscience are Impossible—Our Intelligence Inevitably Fails and Can Only Produce Failure—We Must Use This Failure as an Opportunity to Investigate Our Desire For Biopolitical Visibility</strong><br />
Mike Crang and Stephen Graham, Reader in geography at Durham University and Professor of Human Geography at Durham University, “SENTIENT CITIES:Ambient intelligence and the politics of urban space,” Information, Communication and Society, December 2007 (Ebscohost)<br />
<br />
The second axis across the examples is the structuring of time into spaces through technologies of anticipation and memory. Military technologies, we have suggested, invest in a form of anticipatory seeing, being concerned with what people might do in the future based on profiles of past behaviour. The same is in many senses true of consumer technologies whose aim to offer a customized landscape depends upon anticipating people’s desires based on surveillance of previous consumption habits. Both military and commercial systems use the tracking of visible actions to try and peer inside people’s psyches. They both work by using the capacity for logging actions and connecting memories and stories of people so as to predict future behaviour. But these logs are but the bare bones of lives – the full gamut of the social world rendered as mere transaction and movement. Other emerging ubicomp technologies, however, are being established to try and to re-enchant human links to place by recording and sustaining the personal and transient meanings of places. These artistic practices suggest that the effect of memory is not the creation of perfectly known environments. Rather, it involves a destabilization of spaces, a haunting of place with absent others. The double, indeed triple and quadruple, coding of spaces and people through narratives and information carried in digital networks may thus actually serve to disperse our notion of both person and place. This, then, points to our third recurrent theme. In a sense, following de Certeau, it is clear that the urban ubicomp experiments reviewed here very often involve an erotics of knowledge and a fantasy of perfect vision. We need to recall that these dreams of perfect spatial and urban transparency and omniscience are longstanding. Such dreams always remain unrealized, however, as the contradictions of urban technosocial change always render them rather naıve. As McCullough suggests, experience should tell us that omniscience is elusive. As anyone who has ever tried to resolve a simple billing dispute will know, even the telephone company lacks enough internal coordination to make sense of its data to you. And anyone who has ever dealt with a state-level bureaucracy knows, the odds of omnicompetence remain low. Generally, as information becomes more and more abundant, clear views through it become less and less possible. (McCullough 2004, p. 15) We want to suggest this is not just a technical issue that will be overcome through further technological refinement. What is notable is that, for capital and the military, ubicomp is being invoked as a technical fix or ‘silver bullet’ to somehow magically address complex and deep-seated social and political issues. Urban ubicomp clearly has a fetishistic power in appearing to finally offer solutions by rendering place and space utterly transparent in some simple, deterministic way. Indeed, we would argue that there is a danger that locative media are equally seen as a technical fix for oppositional voices and alternative histories in art projects. In this sense the myths matter and have effects. But they are only mythologies of a perfect, uniform informational landscape. In reality, the seamless and ubiquitous process of pure urban transparency that many accounts suggest will always be little but a fantasy. In practice, the linking of many layers of computerized technology is generally a ‘kludge’, as software designers call it. That is, a bricolage of component middleware, none of which is really designed for the task to which it is put, nor perfectly configured to work with the other middleware or devices it encounters. Computerized systems thus run ‘sub-optimally’ but normally function adequately nonetheless (Mackenzie 2005). Indeed, Matt Locke eloquently describes the complex granularity of this new digital terrain: Mobile networks have to negotiate the architecture of spaces that they attempt to inhabit. Although the interfaces have removed themselves from physical architectures, the radio waves that connect cell spaces are refracted and reflected by the same obstacles, creating not a seamless network but a series of ebbs and flows. The supposedly flat space of the network is in fact not flat, pulled into troughs and peaks by the gravity of architecture and the users themselves. (Manovich 2006, pp. 228–229) Quite the opposite of perfect transparency, a ‘global brain’, or total vision, then! In practice, we may find that temporary and ‘good-enough’ approaches to urban ubicomp may lead to ‘local aggregations of self-connecting systems [that] can become islands of coherence in the chaos raised by pervasive computing’ (McCullough 2004, p. 71). Far from the pure vision of what de Certeau calls the ‘concept city’, we may find the production of myriads of little stories – a messy infinity of ‘Little Brothers’ rather than one omniscient ‘Big’ Brother. Some of these may be commercial, some personal, maybe some militarized. There is a real issue about proliferating knowledges circulating routinely and more or less autonomously of people. But it would seem to us that the political options are not those of rejection or romanticizing notions of disconnection. Rather, it is to work through the inevitable granularity and gaps within these systems, to find the new shadows and opacities that they produce.<br />

<strong>The Label of Terrorist is a Strategy to Demonize and Render Opposition Not Credible—Anything We Cannot Understand Must Support Terror to Justify its Exclusion, Monitoring and Ultimate Destruction</strong><br />
Stephen Graham, Professor of Geography at Durham University, “Cities and the ‘War on Terror,” International Journal of Urban and Regional Research,Spring 2006 (Wiley Interscience)<br />
<br />
Discourses of ‘terrorism’ are crucially important in sustaining such differential values and binaried notions of human worth (Collins and Glover, 2002). Central here is the principle of the absolute externality of the ‘terrorist’ — the inviolable inhumanity and shadowy, monster-like status of those deemed to be actual or dormant ‘terrorists’ or those sympathetic to them (Puar and Rai, 2002). The unbound diffusion of terrorist labelling within the rhetoric of the ‘war on terror’, moreover, works to allow virtually any political opposition to the sovereign power of the US and its allies to be condemned as ‘terrorist’. ‘Without defined shape, or determinate roots’, Derek Gregory writes, the mantle of ‘terrorism’ can now be ‘be cast over any form of resistance to sovereign power’ (2003: 219, original emphasis). Those experiencing frequent ‘terrorist’ labeling by national governments or sympathetic media since 9/11 include anti-war dissenters, critical researchers, anti-globalization protestors, anti-arms-trade campaigners, ecological and freedom of speech lobbyists, and pro-independence campaigners within nations like Indonesia allied to the US. Protagonists of such a wide spectrum of opposition to transnational US dominance are thus all too easily dehumanized or demonized. Above all, they become radically delegitimized.<br />
Who, after all, will speak out in favour of ‘terrorists’ and their sympathizers?<br />
Once achieved, this loose proliferation of ‘terrorist’ labelling works to legitimize ever-widening emergency and ‘anti-terrorist’ legislation. It sustains increasingly militarized civil and law and order policing. And it supports the construction of complex legal and geographical archipelagos operating through networked connections across many geographical scales. Within these, legal ‘states of exception’ are invoked to suspend ‘normal’ legal proceedings, but these themselves increasingly sediment out to become normalized and apparently obdurate (Agamben, 2005).<br />

<strong>Security Politics are Self-Referential Nihilism—The Negative’s Attempt to Force the Political Into the Context of Geopolitical Calculation is the Prerequisite for Any Risk of Extinction</strong><br />
Michael Dillon, Professor of Politics at University of Lancaster, Politics of security: towards a political philosophy of continental thought 1996 (p. 15)<br />
<br />
What truths about the human condition, he therefore prompted me to ask, are thought to be secreted in security? What work does securing security do for and upon us? What power-effects issue out of the regimes of truth of security? If the truth of security compels us to secure security, why, how and where is that grounding compulsion grounded? How was it that seeking security became such an insistent and relentless (inter)national preoccupation for humankind? What sort of project is the pursuit of security, and how does it relate to other modern human concerns and enterprises, such as seeking freedom and knowledge through representative-calculative thought, technology and subjectification? Above all, how are we to account—amongst all the manifest contradictions of our current (inter)national systems of security: which incarcerate rather than liberate; radically endanger rather than make safe; and engender fear rather than create assurance—for that terminal paradox of our modern (inter)national politics of security which Foucault captured so well in the quotation that heads this chapter. 5 A terminal paradox which not only subverts its own predicate of security, most spectacularly by rendering the future of terrestrial existence conditional on the strategies and calculations of its hybrid regime of sovereignty and governmentality, but which also seems to furnish a new predicate of global life, a new experience in the context of which the political has to be recovered and to which it must then address itself: the globalisation of politics of security in the global extension of nihilism and technology, and the advent of the real prospect of human species extinction.<br />

<strong>American Management of Information and Technology to Serve the War Agenda Enables Preemptive Violence and the Continuation of Imperial Aggression</strong><br />
Stephen Graham, Professor of Geography at Durham University, &quot;Interrupting the Algorithmic Gaze? Urban Warfare and US Military Technology,&quot; a Chapter for MacDonald, F. at al (Ed.) Geopolitics and Visual Culture: Representation, Performance, Observant Practice, 2007 (Publication Forthcoming, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.124.2684" rel="nofollow">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.124.2684</a>)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Central to the RMA is the notion that “military operations are now aimed at defined effects rather than attrition of enemy forces or occupation of ground” (Cohen, 2004, 395). Through the interlinkage of the ‘system of systems’ of U.S. military technologies, RMA theorists argue that a truly ‘network centric warfare’ is now possible through which US forces can continually dominate societies deemed to be their adversaries through their increasingly omnipotent surveillance and ‘situational awareness’, devastating and precisely-targeted aerial firepower, and the suppression and degradation of the communications and fighting ability of any opposing forces (Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 2001, Graham, 2005). Thus, RMA theorists imagine US military operations to be a giant, integrated, ‘network enterprise’ – a ‘just-in-time’ system of posthuman, cyborganised warriors which utilises many of the principles of logistics chain management and newtechnology based tracking that are so dominant within contemporary management models (Gray, 2003).</span><br />
Crucial here is the argument that this reduced risk (to US forces) of undertaking military operations is making such interventions much more common, aggressive, and preemptive, as the central basis for US strategy (Barocas, 2002). Such perceptions were central to the Bush Administration's’ launching the ‘pre-emptive war’ as part of an ongoing and unbounded ‘war on terror’ after the 9/11 attacks. They were also central to the influential pronouncements of the Neoconservative Project for a New American Century in 2000, that U.S. forces needed to be redesigned in the post Cold War so that they could “fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars” (2000, see Harris, 2003, Robert et al, 2003). Typical of such arguments, O’ Mara argues that: “It is now possible to use America’s military might with a greatly reduced chance of suffering friendly casualties or equipment loss. The reduction of<br />
American casualties afforded by the marriage between stealthy aircraft and precision guided munitions has had a profound effect on America’s willingness to intervene militarily […] the military must also adapt to its new role as a tool of choice, rather than a tool of last resort” (2003, 4) Importantly, however, such technophiliac discourses depicting an RMA ushering in a new relatively reduced-risk, ‘clean’ and painless strategy of US military dominance assumed that the vast networks of sensors and weapons that needed to be integrated and connected to project US power would work uninterruptedly. Global scales of flow and connection have thus dominated RMA discourses; technological mastery, omnipotent surveillance, real-time ‘situational awareness’, and speed-of-light digital interactions, have been widely portrayed as processes which, intrinsically, would usher in US military<br />
‘Full Spectrum Dominance’, on a planetary scale, irrespective of the geographical terrain that was to be dominated.<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">‘‘Non-Integrating’’ areas are those which are, in the words of Barnett (2004: 8), ‘‘disconnected from the global economy and the rule sets that define its stability’’. But disconnection is not only a ‘‘problem’’ for these societies alone ‘‘In this century, it is disconnectedness that defines danger. Disconnectedness allows bad actors to flourish by keeping entire societies detached from the global community and under their control. Eradicating disconnectedness, therefore, becomes the defining security task of our age’’ (Barnett, 2004: 8).</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Disconnection from the global community e or, as Roberts et al. (2003) argue, the global economy e also brings with it disconnection from the ‘‘rule sets’’ governing ‘‘proper’’ international behaviour: ‘‘enunciating that rule set is the most immediate task in this global war on terrorism, and promoting the global spread of that security rule set through our use of military force overseas (e.g. pre-emptive war against regimes that openly transgress the rule set) is our most important long-term goal in this struggle’’ (Barnett, 2004: 25). As noted above, the American role I the enunciation of a new ‘‘global rule set’’ has been the guiding preoccupation of the Project for the New American Century since its inception: a preoccupation which has been materialized within a number of the National Security Strategies (including the most recent iteration issued in March 2006).</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> It is far from a selfish task, however; Barnett argues that it is</span> America’s ‘‘moral responsibility’’ to ‘‘share’’ the rule set: ‘‘[as] America seeks to export this new security rule set called preemptive war, we are very careful in making sure this strategic concept is correctly understood. In short, pre-emptive war is not a tool for reordering the Core’s security structure as some fear. Rather, it is an instrument by which the Core should collectively seek to extend its stable security rule set into the essentially lawless Gap’’ (Barnett, 2004: 7, 40).<br />
As for Robert Kagan, for Barnett the United States’ role is predicated upon, above all, a privileged knowledge of the rule sets (the ability to define ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘bad’’ states), a privileged understanding of ‘‘the ways the world works’’, but also the willingness to enforce those rule sets. America is the Gap’s Leviathan: ‘‘if other Core powers want a greater say in how we exercise that power, they simply need to dedicate enough defense spending to develop similar capabilities. Absent that, America earns a certain right for unilateralism in the Gap’’ (Barnett, 2004: 173, 174). Similarly echoing Robert Kagan’s dismissal of Europeans’ ‘‘Kantian illusions’’, Barnett is even more resolute in affirming that such ‘‘illusions’’ have no place in today’s chaotic and dangerous world. In justifying the United States resistance to the International Criminal Court, Barnett suggests that it is not a question of American ‘‘exceptionalism’’ but rather the fact ‘‘that America needs special consideration for the security roles it undertakes inside the Gap. In effect, we don’t want fellow Core members applying their Kantian rule sets to our behavior inside the Hobbesian Gap’’ (Barnett, 2004: 174). Barnett suggests that the stakes are high e ‘‘One of us must die.<br />
Either the Core assimilates the Gap, or the Gap divides the Core’’ e and that the only response is to exterminate the ‘‘cancer’’; shrink the gap and thus face up to the reality of the new world situation (Barnett, 2004: 249, 250). As Roberts et al. (2003: 888) suggest, this geopolitics of absolutes is at play beneath the talk of global integration and ‘‘neoliberal world vision’’.<br />
Conflict is therefore inevitable: it is a foundational truth confirmed by the severed map. Barnett’s cartography thus serves as both a description of today’s world and a prescriptionfor its proper ordering. As Roberts et al. (2003: 890) argue, ‘‘the map is both that which it to be explained and the explanation itself, descriptive of the recent past and predictive of future action’’. Insecurity comes not from a specific threatening other but from all those unwilling to integrate; all those refusing their (prescribed) place on the map. As Monmonier puts it, the map’s ‘‘lines and labels not only rationalize the current [Iraqi] occupation.but also argue for future interventions throughout the Gap’’ (Monmonier, 2005: 222). This understanding was clearly articulated in Barnett’s first book (Barnett, 2004), but is even more explicit in the follow-up volume, revealingly entitled Blueprint for Action (Barnett, 2005). US interventions are thus presented as inevitable, until the messiness of the world is made to match the geometries of the Pentagon’s New Map.<br />

<strong>Securitization is a Self Fulfilling Prophecy—The Social Construction of Enmity Means That the Attempt to Solidify The World Based on Specific Political Rivalries Creates the Condition for Violence in the First Place</strong><br />

<br />
How do such discourses begin? In his investigation of the historical origins of the concept, James Der Derian (Chapter 2: &quot;The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche and Baudrillard&quot;) points out that, in the past, security has been invoked not only to connote protection from threats, along the lines of the conventional definition, but also to describe hubristic overconfidence as well as a bond or pledge provided in a financial transaction. To secure oneself is, therefore, a sort of trap, for one can never leave a secure place without incurring risks. (Elsewhere, Barry Buzan has pointed out that &quot;There is a cruel irony in [one] meaning of secure which is `unable to escape.' &quot; 16 ) Security, moreover, is meaningless without an &quot;other&quot; to help specify the conditions of insecurity. Der Derian, citing Nietzsche, points out that this &quot;other&quot; is made manifest through differences that create terror and collective resentment of difference--the state of fear--rather than a preferable coming to terms with the positive potentials of difference. As these differences become less than convincing, however, their power to create fear and terror diminish, and so it becomes necessary to create ever more menacing threats to reestablish difference. For this purpose, Der Derian argues, reality is no longer sufficient; only the creation of a &quot;hyperreal&quot; world of computer and media-imaged and -imagined threats will do. Or, to cite Baudrillard, as Der Derian does: &quot;It is no longer a question of a false representation of reality (ideology), but of concealing the fact that the real is no longer real.&quot; It is the imagined, unnamed party, with the clandestinely assembled and crude atomic device, and not the thousands of reliable, high-yield warheads mounted on missiles poised to launch at a moment's notice, that creates fear, terror, and calls for greater surveillance and enforcement. Yet, according to Der Derian, describing how the solitary computer wargaming of the Iraqi and American militaries were literally joined together in battle on the deserts of the Persian Gulf littoral, hyperreal threats do sometimes have an odd way of becoming material. The Gulf War created a &quot;real&quot; simulation, broadcast to the watching billions, that was later found out to have been a less-than-accurate representation. This does not mean that those who died suffered simulated deaths. Simulated threats may be imagined, but their ultimate consequences are all too real. What this process suggests is that concepts of security arise, to a great degree, out of discursive practices within states and, only secondarily, among states. 17 Ole Wæver (Chapter 3: &quot;Securitization and Desecuritization&quot;) illuminates this aspect of security, framing it not as an objective or material condition, but as a &quot;speech act,&quot; enunciated by elites in order to securitize issues or &quot;fields,&quot; thereby helping to reproduce the hierarchical conditions that characterize security practices. Thus, according to Wæver, much of the agenda of &quot;redefining security&quot; is a process of bringing into the field of security those things that, perhaps, should remain outside (but this struggle to redefine a concept can also be seen as an effort by heretofore-excluded elites to enter the security discourse). He warns, therefore, that redefining security in a conventional sense, either to encompass new sources of threat or specify new referent objects, risks applying the traditional logic of military behavior to nonmilitary problems. This process can also expand the jurisdiction of already-expansive states as well. As Wæver puts it, &quot;By naming a certain development a security problem, the `state' [claims] . . . a special right [to intervene].&quot; In intervening, the tools applied by the state would look very much like those used during the wars the state might launch if it chose to do so. This contradiction was apparent in the initial landing of U.S. Marines in Somalia in December, 1992. Demonstrably, there was a question of matching force to force in this case, but the ostensible goal of humanitarian assistance took on the appearance of a military invasion (with the added hyperreality of resistance offered only by the mass(ed) media waiting on shore). This does not mean that Wæver thinks that &quot;security as a speech act&quot; should not be applied to anything at all; only that it is necessary to consider with care what is implied or involved if we are indiscriminate in doing so. Security is, to put Wæver's argument in other words, a socially constructed concept: It has a specific meaning only within a specific social context. 18 It emerges and changes as a result of discourses and discursive actions intended to reproduce historical structures and subjects within states and among them. 19 To be sure, policymakers define security on the basis of a set of assumptions regarding vital interests, plausible enemies, and possible scenarios, all of which grow, to a not-insignificant extent, out of the specific historical and social context of a particular country and some understanding of what is &quot;out there.&quot; 20 But, while these interests, enemies, and scenarios have a material existence and, presumably, a real import for state security, they cannot be regarded simply as having some sort of &quot;objective&quot; reality independent of these constructions. 21 That security is socially constructed does not mean that there are not to be found real, material conditions that help to create particular interpretations of threats, or that such conditions are irrelevant to either the creation or undermining of the assumptions underlying security policy. Enemies, in part, &quot;create&quot; each other, via the projections of their worst fears onto the other; in this respect, their relationship is intersubjective. To the extent that they act on these projections, threats to each other acquire a material character. In other words, nuclear-tipped ICBMs are not mere figments of our imagination, but their targeting is a function of what we imagine the possessors of other missiles might do to us with theirs . 22<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">(U) The Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT) program will develop and demonstrate a system for video data exploitation that enables an analyst to rapidly find video content of interest from archives and to provide alerts to the analyst of events of interest during live operations. The ability to quickly search large volumes of existing video data and monitor real-time video data for specific activities or events will provide a dramatic new capability to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies. Currently, video analysis for Predator and other aerial video surveillance platforms is very labor intensive, and limited to metadata queries, manual annotations, and “fast-forward” examination of clips. The software tools developed under VIRAT will radically improve the analysis of huge volumes of video data by: 1) alerting operators when specific events or activities occur at specific locations or over a range of locations and; 2) enabling fast, content-based searches of existing video archives. The VIRAT program is developing innovative algorithms for activity representation, matching and recognition which can support both indexing and retrieval. The primary focus of VIRAT is activity-based and dynamic information. Object/scene matching and recognition are also of interest, but only to the extent they support activity analysis. The final product of the VIRAT program is a system that can be transitioned to and integrated within an operational military system, such as the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS).</span><br />

<span class="cite">Slavoj Zizek, “The Iraqi MacGuffin,” April 11th, 2004 (<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/iraq1.htm#copy" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/iraq1.htm#copy</a></span>)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Its main points are: American military might should remain &quot;beyond challenge&quot; in the foreseeable future; since the main enemy today is an &quot;irrational&quot; fundamentalist who, in contrast to Communists, lacks even the elementary sense of survival and respect of his own people, America has the right to preemptive strikes (i.e., to attack countries which do not already pose a clear threat to the U.S., but MIGHT pose such a threat in the foreseeable future); while the U.S. should seek ad hoc international coalitions for such attacks, it should reserve the right to act independently if it does not get sufficient international support. So, while the U.S. presents its domination over other sovereign states as grounded in a benevolent paternalism which takes into account the interests of other nations and their people, it reserves for itself the ultimate right to DEFINE its allies' &quot;true&quot; interests. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The logic is thus clearly formulated: even the pretense of a neutral international law is abandoned, since, when the U.S. perceives a potential threat, they formally ask their allies to support them, but the allies' agreement is optional. The underlying message is always &quot;we will do it with or without you&quot; (i.e., you are free to agree with us, but not free to disagree). The old paradox of the forced choice is reproduced here: the freedom to make a choice on condition that one makes the right choice. The &quot;Bush doctrine&quot; relies on the violent assertion of the paranoiac logic of total control over FUTURE threats, justifying preemptive strikes against these supposed threats. The ineptness of such an approach for today's universe, in which knowledge circulates freely, is patent. The loop between the present and the future is closed: the prospect of a breathtaking terrorist act is evoked in order to justify incessant preemptive strikes now. This closed loop was perfectly formulated in a TV debate in February 2002, when the actor and ex-Congressman Fred Thompson said, in defense of President Bush's Iraq politics: &quot;When anti-war protesters say 'But what did Iraq effectively DO to the US? It did not attack us!', one should answer it with the question 'And what did the terrorists who destroyed the Twin Towers effectively DO to the U.S. before September 11? They also did nothing!'&quot;</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Relying on Consultation as the Form of Governance is an Attempt to Make Politics Apolitical and Cover Over Fundamental Antagonisms, Means We Cannot Challenge Ideological Structures</span></strong><br />
Dr. Thomas Lemke, Institute for Social Research, Frankfurt, “An indigestible meal? Foucault, governmentality and state theory,” Distinktion: Scandinavian Journal of Social Theory, 2007 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thomaslemkeweb.de/publikationen/IndigestibleMealfinal5.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.thomaslemkeweb.de/publikationen/IndigestibleMealfinal5.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This brings us to a second difference that relates to the role of politics in governance literature. The governance discourse involves dialogue, participation, representation and the inclusion of “the governed”. It seeks to give visibility to interests that are often ignored and extents the public sphere insofar as it promotes the consultation and implication of a whole range of societal and economic actors who are addressed as “partners” or “stakeholders”.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> However, there are some serious shortcomings to be noted that limit the promise of an increasing democratisation. The governance literature assumes that political decisions are based on neutral facts or rational arguments, thereby ignoring the role of strategic options and political alternatives. As a consequence, it often marginalizes central conflicts between different social groups and classes or downplays contradictions between political interests and objectives – and is rightly criticized for “failing to take note of important aspects in the analysis of political processes that pertain to a sociology of domination” (Mayntz, 2004: 74; Smouts 1998). For example, most of the literature on global governance takes it for granted that the political and social cleavages between those who profit from globalization and those</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">who do not can be bridged by “modern” or “good” governance. In this view, poverty and wealth have nothing to do with each other, and economic growth, ecological considerations, political democracy, social solidarity, healthy living etc. appear to be equally achievable –</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">without radically changing established political and social structures (Brunnengräber and Stock, 1999; Rucht, 2001; Brand, 2004). While an analytics of government endorses a strategic account stressing the constitutive role of political conflicts and confrontations, the governance discourse seeks to minimize “frictions” and is characterised by an “antipolitical politics“ (Walters, 2004: 33-7; Hirst, 2000; Mouffe, 2005).</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It follows that the governance discourse promotes a technocratic model of steering and managing – this feature marks the third point where the governance discourse departs from an analytics of government. Most of the governance literature relies heavily on a certain kind of</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">metanarrative. It claims to be a political response to the growing social complexity that calls for multilevel, networked, cooperative, heterarchic alternatives to hierarchic and state-centred forms of regulation (Jessop 1998).14 However, this account represents a rather distorted image of the past ignoring the multiple ways in which even the most interventionist welfare states governed by “indirect” mechanisms and forms of cooperation and implication: “Governance theory works with a somewhat exaggerated conception of the power of the postwar welfare state. This has the effect, in turn, of overemphasizing the novelty and significance of many of the phenomena of ‘steering’, ‘regulation’, and indirect control typically grouped under the rubric of ‘new’ governance.” (Walters, 2004: 38) The caricature of a time when states were “whole” (and not yet “fragmented” and “decentred”) serves as background for the claim of a decisive historical break: The diagnosis of a growing complexity of the social world – the globalisation of financial and other markets, the importance of informational and</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">communicate technologies, the appearance of new forms of production etc. – is linked to an idea of the “end of politics”, to a “post-ideological” world order that is no longer governed by fundamental conflicts and oppositions. In this view, governance is about steering and</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">regulating a world without radical alternatives, it is animated by the search for “rational”, “responsible” and “efficient” instruments of problem management. On this reading, strategic interests are reduced to technological concerns; politics just seems to follow the dictate of a</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> structural logic of complexity. In contrast to this technocratic and managerialist approach, an analytics of government is more reflexive concerning the function of political knowledge and the intimate link between politics and technology. It does not take the “complexity” narrative at face value but investigates the role it plays in constituting and legitimising governance as a particular syle of rule (Walters, 2004: 40-41).</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The logical use of the sinthome, says Lacan on the 18th of Nov. 1975,10 is to reach the real at the end of which it has not thirst, which is to be a heretic in the good way. This is clearer in Seminar II 11: at the terminal point of a chain of signifiers we have to account for our crimes, but, he continues, if we know how to account for them we wont be punished. At this terminal point there is a know-how. The subject has a responsibility to develop a know-how in the psychoanalytical process in which the subject accounts for its sins without punishment. It is the artifice of the analysis. The know-how of the psychoanalytical process is Crime without Punishment, or sin without the negative therapeutic reaction. But that will not work unless enjoyment is evacuated from the system. We might say that the subject has a responsibility to acquire this know-how.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Lacan says on the 13 of Jan. 1976 that one’s responsibility goes as far as one’s know-how.12 The more know-how the subject acquires, the more responsibility it has and the less sin. Knowing how in analysis to account for one’s crimes is a responsibility the analysand assumes. In this process the subject becomes a sinthome. But know-how is an artifice which in the case of Joyce is the form of his art. His art, says Lacan, corresponds to the phallus which makes up for his missing Oedipus. Artifice in this seminar seems to be an indication of a foreclosure. For Joyce the father is an artificer: ‘Old father, old artificer, stand now and ever in good state’. It is one of the names of the father that is a stabilising factor in Joyce’s structure. The artifice in the case of Joyce orients him towards the symbolic: to make himself into a book. Know-how in the case of the neurotic orients the subject on the real of his or her crimes. One’s responsibility goes as far as the real. </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Counterplan Can’t Solve the Case—Links to All Our Impact Arguments—The Focus on Governmentality is a Way to Obscure the Function and Clash of Power Within the Political</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Mitchell Dean, Professor, Sociology, Macquarie University, GOVERNMENTALITY: POWER AND RULE IN MODERN SOCIETY, London: Sage, 1999, p. 47.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The elaboration of a notion of government marks the definitive rejection of a certain type of radical declamatory rhetoric of power and the beginning of a project to think about the problem of regulation outside earlier models of power. The focus on government seeks to displace both the notion of power as repression or interdiction that Foucault had traced to the `juridical-political theory of sovereignty' and his own earlier attempts to rethink power in terms of `the discourse of war and domination'. `Power is less a con­frontation between two adversaries or the linking of one to the other than a question of government . . . [which] did not refer only to political structures or to the management of states; rather it designated the way in which the con-duct of individuals or groups might be directed' (Foucault, 1982: 221). Importantly, then, the notion of government stands as an attempt to pose the question of the epistemological and technical conditions of existence of the political, to analyse the historical a priori by which we construct politics as a domain of thought and action, and to analyse the instrumentation, vocabu­lary and forms of reason by which this is done. If, for Kant, `critique' is the study of the conditions of true knowledge, the study of governmentality is a kind of critique of political reason, in as much as it seeks to investigate some of the hitherto silent conditions under which we can think and act politically. Perhaps, as we have suggested before, given the association of critique with the universal foundations of truth and right, it is better to refer to Foucault's task as a criticism of political reason, as he does in the English title of his lec­tures at Stanford (Foucault, 1981).</span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The second phase of executive-order usage began after World War II, when presidents used them to exercise their newly expanded powers. In foreign affairs, the expanded executive pursued Cold War operations, from foreign aid to intelligence gathering to military operations. But executive orders were also deployed on the home front to initiate social change in the face of congressional and public opposition, most notably on civil rights. In 1941, after meeting extensively with civil-rights leaders, Roosevelt used the executive order to create the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC), forbidding discrimination by federal contractors. The FEPC proved ineffective, but it gave notice to Congress and the public that civil rights was on the president's agenda and that he was willing to act alone to improve them. Following the war, Truman lined up a series of executive orders to promote his civil-rights agenda, including military desegregation and a restructured FEPC. As Sherie Merson and Steven Schlossman note in their book, Foxholes and Color Lines, &quot;[Truman's] intervention emboldened advocates of racial equality, put supporters of segregation on the defensive, and opened a path leading toward the completion of formal racial integration.&quot; John F. Kennedy used the executive order to establish the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, and Lyndon Johnson initiated affirmative action with an order to federal contractors regarding hiring practices. As Mayer noted, &quot;The executive order became a powerful symbol of presidential commitment to racial equality,&quot; galvanizing a movement that went on to force change at all levels of society.</span> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In all these domains, the difJerend seems to be irreducible - that is to say, sooner or later we find ourselves in a grey zone whose mit cannot be dispelled,.by the application of some single universal rule. Here we encounter a kind of counterpoint' to the 'uncertainty principe' of quan tum physics; there is, for example, a structural difficulty in determining whether some comment was actually a case of sexual harassment or one of racist hate speech. Confronted with such a dubious statement, a 'politically correct' radical a priori tends to believe the complaining victim (if the victim experienced it as harassment, then harassment it was. . .), while a diehard orthodox liberal tends to believe the accused (if he sincerely did not mean it as harassment, then he should be acquitted. . .). The point, of course, is that this undecidability is structural and unavoid able, since it is the big Other (the symbolic network in which victim and offender are both embedded) which ultimately 'decides' on meaning, and the order of the big Other is, by definition, open; nobody can dominate and regulate its effects. That is the problem with replacing aggressive with 'politically correct' expressions: whan one replaces 'short-sighted' with 'visually challenged', tone can never be sure that this replacement itself will not generate new effects of patronizing and/or ironic offensiveness, all the more humiliating inasmuch as it is masked as benevolence. The mistake of this 'politically correct' strategy is that it underestimates the resistance of the Ianguage we actually speak to the conscious regulation of its effects, epecially effects that involve Power relations. So to resolve the deadlock, one convenes a committee to formulate, in an ultimately arbitrary way, the precise rules of conduct. It is the same with medicine and 'biogenetics (at what point does an acceptable and even desirable genetic experiment or intervention turn into unacceptable manipulation?), in the application of universal hum all rights (at what point does the protection 0f the victim's rights turn into an imposition of Western values?), in sexual mores (what is the proper, non-patriarchal procedure of seduc tion?), not to mention the obvious case of cyberspace (what is the status of sexual harassment in a virtual community? How does one distinguish between 'mere words' and 'deeds'?). The work of these committees is caught in a symptomal vicious cycle: on the one hand, they try to legitimate their decisions by reference to the most advanced scientific ,knowledge (which, in the case of abortion, tells us that a foetus does not yet possess self-awareness and experience pain; which, in the case of a mortally ill person, defines the threshold beyond which euthanasia is the only meaningful solution); on the other hand, they have to evoke some non-scientific ethical criterion in order to direct and posit a limitation to.</span><br />

<strong>Your Argument Begins From the Wrong Question—By Presuming the Perspective of the Institution, Even Proposing the Disad Destroys Our Ability to Challenge The Manifestations of Power</strong><br />
John D. Caputo and Mark Yount, Villanova University, St. Joseph’s University, “Institutions, Normalization, and Power.” Foucault and the Critique of Institutions. 1993 (no page)<br />
<br />
The connection between Foucault and institutions seems an obvious one, but not because he wanted to make the institution the basic unit of<br />
analysis. On the contrary, Foucault situated institutions within the thin but all-entangling web of power relations. He did so explicitly in Discipline and Punish, and he subsequently read his later analysis between the lines of his earlier works. In this genealogy, institutions are the more readily definable macro-objects, grosser instruments for the finer, more elemental workings of power. Power is the thin, inescapable film that covers all human interactions, whether inside institutions or out. Institutional structures are saturated with sexual relations, economic relations, social relations, etc., and are always established of these power relations:relations between men and women, old and young, senior and junior,well-born and starved, colorless and colored, Occident and Orient. Institutions are the means that power uses, and not the other way around, not sources or origins of power. The analysis of power is thus always more fine-grained than any analysis of classes, of states, or of institutions in their own terms would be. That is why for Foucault--and for all of the studies that follow here--the workings of power cannot be described from the standpoint of a master discipline, especially a perspective that would seek an origin for power, or take political power to be its initial or privileged form. It is always a question of analyzing institutions from the standpoint of power, and not of analyzing power from the standpoint of institutions.'<br />
But we ought not to speak of power in the substantive, for there is no such thing. Instead, sets of &quot;power relations&quot; bathe the structures and<br />
edifices of human life, without power ever amounting to a thing or substance. It is not the very substance- and- subject of the historical<br />
process, like the Hegelian spirit, not the driving movement of contradictory social relations, as in Marx, not the unifying- gathering power that<br />
holds sway over all in Heidegger's history of Being. (The similarities might not be entirely accidental, though: see Mohanty's paper herein,<br />
'Foucault as Philosopher, 1) Power is not one thing, but multiple and multiplied, scattered and disseminated.<br />

<strong>Securitization is a Self Fulfilling Prophecy—The Social Construction of Enmity Means That the Attempt to Solidify The World Based on Specific Political Rivalries Creates the Condition for Violence in the First Place</strong><br />
Lipschutz 98 (On Security, Assistant Professor of Politics, Director of the Adlai Stevenson Program on Global Security, University of California, Santa Cruz Ronnie D. Lipschutz, editor)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">How do such discourses begin? In his investigation of the historical origins of the concept, James Der Derian (Chapter 2: &quot;The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche and Baudrillard&quot;) points out that, in the past, security has been invoked not only to connote protection from threats, along the lines of the conventional definition, but also to describe hubristic overconfidence as well as a bond or pledge provided in a financial transaction. To secure oneself is, therefore, a sort of trap, for one can never leave a secure place without incurring risks. (Elsewhere, Barry Buzan has pointed out that &quot;There is a cruel irony in [one] meaning of secure which is `unable to escape.' &quot; 16 ) Security, moreover, is meaningless without an &quot;other&quot; to help specify the conditions of insecurity. Der Derian, citing Nietzsche, points out that this &quot;other&quot; is made manifest through differences that create terror and collective resentment of difference--the state of fear--rather than a preferable coming to terms with the positive potentials of difference. As these differences become less than convincing, however, their power to create fear and terror diminish, and so it becomes necessary to create ever more menacing threats to reestablish difference. For this purpose, Der Derian argues, reality is no longer sufficient; only the creation of a &quot;hyperreal&quot; world of computer and media-imaged and -imagined threats will do. Or, to cite Baudrillard, as Der Derian does: &quot;It is no longer a question of a false representation of reality (ideology), but of concealing the fact that the real is no longer real.&quot; It is the imagined, unnamed party, with the clandestinely assembled and crude atomic device, and not the thousands of reliable, high-yield warheads mounted on missiles poised to launch at a moment's notice, that creates fear, terror, and calls for greater surveillance and enforcement. Yet, according to Der Derian, describing how the solitary computer wargaming of the Iraqi and American militaries were literally joined together in battle on the deserts of the Persian Gulf littoral, hyperreal threats do sometimes have an odd way of becoming material. The Gulf War created a &quot;real&quot; simulation, broadcast to the watching billions, that was later found out to have been a less-than-accurate representation. This does not mean that those who died suffered simulated deaths. Simulated threats may be imagined, but their ultimate consequences are all too real. What this process suggests is that concepts of security arise, to a great degree, out of discursive practices within states and, only secondarily, among states. 17 Ole Wæver (Chapter 3: &quot;Securitization and Desecuritization&quot;) illuminates this aspect of security, framing it not as an objective or material condition, but as a &quot;speech act,&quot; enunciated by elites in order to securitize issues or &quot;fields,&quot; thereby helping to reproduce the hierarchical conditions that characterize security practices. Thus, according to Wæver, much of the agenda of &quot;redefining security&quot; is a process of bringing into the field of security those things that, perhaps, should remain outside (but this struggle to redefine a concept can also be seen as an effort by heretofore-excluded elites to enter the security discourse). He warns, therefore, that redefining security in a conventional sense, either to encompass new sources of threat or specify new referent objects, risks applying the traditional logic of military behavior to nonmilitary problems. This process can also expand the jurisdiction of already-expansive states as well. As Wæver puts it, &quot;By naming a certain development a security problem, the `state' [claims] . . . a special right [to intervene].&quot; In intervening, the tools applied by the state would look very much like those used during the wars the state might launch if it chose to do so. This contradiction was apparent in the initial landing of U.S. Marines in Somalia in December, 1992. Demonstrably, there was a question of matching force to force in this case, but the ostensible goal of humanitarian assistance took on the appearance of a military invasion (with the added hyperreality of resistance offered only by the mass(ed) media waiting on shore). This does not mean that Wæver thinks that &quot;security as a speech act&quot; should not be applied to anything at all; only that it is necessary to consider with care what is implied or involved if we are indiscriminate in doing so. Security is, to put Wæver's argument in other words, a socially constructed concept: It has a specific meaning only within a specific social context. 18 It emerges and changes as a result of discourses and discursive actions intended to reproduce historical structures and subjects within states and among them. 19 To be sure, policymakers define security on the basis of a set of assumptions regarding vital interests, plausible enemies, and possible scenarios, all of which grow, to a not-insignificant extent, out of the specific historical and social context of a particular country and some understanding of what is &quot;out there.&quot; 20 But, while these interests, enemies, and scenarios have a material existence and, presumably, a real import for state security, they cannot be regarded simply as having some sort of &quot;objective&quot; reality independent of these constructions. 21 That security is socially constructed does not mean that there are not to be found real, material conditions that help to create particular interpretations of threats, or that such conditions are irrelevant to either the creation or undermining of the assumptions underlying security policy. Enemies, in part, &quot;create&quot; each other, via the projections of their worst fears onto the other; in this respect, their relationship is intersubjective. To the extent that they act on these projections, threats to each other acquire a material character. In other words, nuclear-tipped ICBMs are not mere figments of our imagination, but their targeting is a function of what we imagine the possessors of other missiles might do to us with theirs . 22</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> But the demise of the communist bloc did not make Americans feel more secure. On the contrary, a chorus of elite voices insisted that it made us less secure, because now the enemy could be anyone, anywhere. Moreover, the war on terrorism is a direct legacy of the cold war. Al-Qaeda and similar Muslim groups were enabled, perhaps even created, by the CIA. The grievances that brought them together were virtually all fallout from the U.S. effort to keep Soviet influence out of the Middle East. The U.S. role as the sole remaining superpower virtually insured that it would become the target of global attacks. Just as the outcome of World War I sowed the seeds of World War II, and the outcome of World War II the seeds of the cold war, so the outcome of the cold war sowed the seeds of the war on terrorism. And this newest war is already, quite visibly, sowing the seeds of insecurity to come. It may be most useful to view the whole period from the early cold war years through the present war as a single historical era: the era of the national insecurity state. Throughout that era, U.S. policy decisions made in the name of national security consistently breed a greater sense of vulnerability, frustration, and insecurity. It is not hard to see why. Four decades of cold war enshrined two fundamental principles at the heart of our public life: there is a mortal threat to the very existence of our nation, and our own policies play no role in generating the threat. The belief structure of the national insecurity state flows logically from these premises. If our nation bears no responsibility, then we are powerless to eradicate the threat. If others threaten us through no fault of our own, what can we do? There is no hope for a truly better world, nor for ending the danger by mutual compromise with &quot;the other side.&quot; The threat is effectively eternal. The best to hope for is to hold the threat forever at bay. Yet the sense of powerlessness is oddly satisfying, because it preserves the conviction of innocence: if our policies are so ineffectual, the troubles of the world can hardly be our fault. And the vision of an endless status quo is equally satisfying, because it promises to prevent historical change. If peril is permanent, the world is an endless reservoir of potential enemies. Any fundamental change in the status quo portends only catastrophe. The only path to security, it seems, is to prevent change by imposing control over others. When those others fight back, the national insecurity state protests its innocence: we act only in self-defense; we want only stability. The state sees no reason to re-evaluate its policies; that would risk the change it seeks, above all, to avoid. So it can only meet violence with more violence. Of course, the inevitable frustration is blamed on the enemy, reinforcing the sense of peril and the demand for absolute control through violence. The goal of total control is self-defeating; each step toward security becomes a source of, and is taken as proof of, continuing insecurity.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Dalby 2 ( Simon- PHD, Prof @ Carleton U, Environmental Security, Intro- pg XXXII, 2, ET)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Environmental politics is very much about the politics of dis-course, the presentation of &quot;problems,&quot; and of who should deal with the concerns so specified. These discourses frequently turn complex political matters into managerial and technological issues of sustainable development where strategies of &quot;ecological modernization&quot; finnesse the questions by promising technical solutions to numerous political difficulties and, in the process, work to co-opt or marginalize fundamental challenges to the contemporary world order.51 In Tim Luke's apt summation: &quot;Underneath the enchanting green patina, sustainable development is about sustaining development as economically rationalized environment rather than the development of a sustaining ecology.&quot; Linking such themes to security, with its practices of specifying threats and its managerial modes for responding to dangers, suggests a broad congruency of discourse and practice.53 But what ought to be secured frequently remains unexamined, as does the precise nature of what it is that causes contemporary endangerments. Like other disciplinary endeavors, both environmental management and security studies have their practices for the delimitation of appropriate objects, methods, and procedures. Making these explicit and showing how they both facilitate and simultaneously limit inquiry is an unavoidable task for any study that takes Foucault's for-mulation of critique seriously. Challenging conventional wisdom is rarely easy, and disrupting geopolitical categories can be especially &quot;unsettling.&quot; Asking unsettling questions about the identities of those who think in the conventional categories is not easy either. But it seems very necessary now, given the limitations of both the security and the environmental discourses we have inherited from the past and the pressing need to think intelligently about what kind of planet we are making.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Disease is always seen as a threat from somewhere else, empirically acting to securitize people against other groups of people.</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Campbell 98 (David- PHD, Prof of cultural &amp; poli geog @ U of Durham, Writing Security, p. 98-99,ET)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; margin-left: 0in;">What has been and remains central to the logic of socio-medical discourse is thus not the biological nature of disease, but a sense that disease is always from somewhere else. As Sontag notes, 'there is a link between imagining disease and imagining foreignness.' Indeed, when syphilis reached epidemic proportions in fifteenth-century Europe, 'It was the 'French pox' to the English, morbus Germanicus to the Parisians, the Naples sickness to the Florentines, [and] the Chinese disease to the Japanese.'62 But 'foreignness' does not necessarily coincide with places distant and removed: the foreign can also reside within; something that is evident when (as in the United States) disease is more readily diagnosed in the elderly, the poor, or the working class, even when other groups exhibit many more identifiably biological pathologies.63 In the same manner, we can note how various groups within American and European domestic society have been constituted as marginal through the figurations of socio¬medical discourse. Women, blacks, and Jews have at one time or another all been understood as uniquely susceptible to certain disorders. Women were diagnosed as exhibiting a high incidence of hysteria; Jews in general were believed to be prone to psychological disorders; Jewish men were thought to menstruate like women and thus be a source of social `pollution'; blacks were overwhelmingly considered insane. And for each of these groups, sexuality was medicalized as pathology and indicted as a threat to the integrity of the body politic.&quot; In sum, two things are particularly striking about these examples of the historical operation of socio-medical discourse. Firstly, it has often been able to function either without any empirical referent from which its valuations are theoretically derived, or it has accomplished its task in direct contradistinction to available empirical sources. The moral characteristics of leprosy lived on after its demise; neither women, nor blacks, nor Jews were any more vulnerable to psychological disorders than any other groups; and Jewish men certainly did not menstruate.65 Secondly, the modes of representation through which these groups are marked as social dangers effectively blend and fuse together various stigmata of difference, such that each figuration of difference functions, not as an image derived from a correspondence relationship, but as an indicator of the various images with which it has some perceived affinity. Or, as Hayden White suggests of metaphor generally, it 'functions as a symbol, rather than as a sign: which is to say that it does not give us either a description or an icon of the thing it represents, but tells us what images to look for in our culturally encoded Foreign policy and difference experience in order to determine how we should feel about the thing represented.'66</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Today, a similar set of circumstances, brought on by economic globalization, seems to be developing and imposing costs and risks on the very people it is intended to benefit. In this context, talk of &quot;economic security&quot; becomes, once again, a speech act that seeks to legitimate a policy that promises very real insecurity for many. The market is a place full of risks, and only those who are willing to take risks in the market are likely to reap great benefits; given the logic of the market, these same individuals also risk bankruptcy and personal economic insecurity (an outcome only too evident in Orange County California's declaration of bankruptcy and Mexico's economic travails). </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Indeed, as Beverly Crawford's chapter seems to suggest, in a world of economic globalism, in which states must collaborate to foster global capitalism, and the processes of production, consumption, and accumulation become decoupled from individual states, it becomes more and more difficult to constitute an Other that might be transformed into a threatening enemy, thereby legitimating the differential degrees of personal and national security awarded by the market. We have seen some feeble efforts, based on notions of economic competitiveness and technological innovation, and given illustration in Michael Crichton's xenophobic and misogynistic Rising Sun , but these seem not to be very persuasive. A few argue that we (the United States) must become more like the Other (Japan) if we are to be made secure. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz18.html#note16" rel="nofollow">16</a> How different this is from the world(s) of Morgenthau and Waltz! </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Business and capital are only too aware of this paradox, whereas the world of states and military power seems blissfully oblivious to it. For capital, there are no enemies, only competitors; indeed, the market, while competitive, is a realm of cooperation , not conflict, as is often assumed. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz18.html#note17" rel="nofollow">17</a> Markets are rule-governed institutions and, to get along, you must go <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:140:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@221&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: 221&quot;/&gt; --><a name="221"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:140 -->along.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Not everyone is, of course, a participant in the market; indeed, there are billions of people and dozens of countries that are not. In spite of warnings about instability as the &quot;enemy,&quot; these people and &quot;states&quot; are neither enemies nor threats to us in either an objective or intersubjective sense. Rather, the places in which many of them are found are more akin to realms constituted or consumed by chaos. The inhabitants of these zone participate in neither statist politics nor global markets as we understand them, not so much out of choice or desire as out of the logic of economic globalization driven by capitalism and the industrial coalition. But these zones of chaos are not just places &quot;outside&quot; of space or time; paradoxically, perhaps, they are sites of political experimentation, from which are emerging &quot;world systems&quot; that, if successful, could ultimately undermine the relative orderliness of the peaceful zones of the industrial coalition.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;">Liberal rights thus became outmoded. Beyond an inaccurate view of where power is located in society at large, however, the social contract theory, which has historically provided the justification for rights, also fails to recognize the actual practice of disciplinary power. Contracts in general, and social contracts providing for the protection of natural rights in particular, are fundamentally reciprocal and egalitarian. There are two or more signatories, each of which is equally bound by the terms of the contract. The sovereign, for Locke, Madison, and others, is given the power to make laws and to punish transgression of that law, while having limits placed on its power, particularly in regards to fundamental rights. In contrast to this formal, contractual equality, the disciplines &quot;are essentially nonegalitarian and asymmetrical&quot; (Foucault, 1979, p. 222). One person, for instance, administers the examination, the other is examined. Or, to take another example, the guard in the tower of the Panopticon observes the prisoner, patient, or pupil in his cell, who becomes &quot;the object of information, never a subject in communication&quot; (p. 200). Thus, although social contract theory emphasizes the contractual relations in society, the actual diffusion of the disciplines has had the effect of undermining our formal equality and instead introducing innumerable relations of asymmetry and domination. Furthermore, although these rights establish areas of protected action, the disciplines extend beyond and below the level of law and rights, establishing &quot;an 'infra-penality'; they partitioned an area that the laws had left empty&quot; (Foucault, 1979, p. 178). The disciplines, both on their own and through the human sciences that they serve as the basis for, establish norms and categories that one must live up to or fall within. If one does not, one is subject to the micropenalties that the disciplines rely on, even when one is obeying the law. The areas of protected action and privacy that rights were meant to establish thereby become infiltrated by disciplinary power and its system of punishments and rewards. The result is that a range of behaviors that were left untouched under the premodern system of punishment have now become, despite the formal protection of rights, subject to penalties (p. 105)</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Liberalism can thus be characterized as a critique of state reason, as Gordon (1991: 15) puts it, a doctrine of the wise limitation and restraint on the exercise of authority by sovereign bodies and a form of pedagogy of sovereigns and statesmen. As such, as Rose (1996b: 43-4) has pointed out, it proposes two kinds of limits to the action of the state. The first concerns what it is possible to know and shape at will. For liberalism, the reality to be governed is constituted by several processes that are both necessary to the ends of good government and not directly visible to the agents of sovereignty. The exemplar of these autonomous processes is `the economy' construed as a sphere of quasi-natural processes having a law-like quality, although similar critiques of state reason can be made in the name of the realities of `the population' or `civil society'. These are spheres construed as outside the domain of political authority and having forces and relations intrinsic to them that must be respected by the exercise of that authority. A key component of liberalism as an art of government is to find a set of political norms that can balance the competing imperatives that can be derived from a knowledge of the processes that constitute these spheres. Thus a knowledge of the processes that constitute the health, happiness and well-being of the population might lead to a coordinated and centralized apparatus for the administration of life. This `bio-political' norm for liberalism needs to be set against norms of economic government. The latter are derived from a knowledge of economic processes, whereby excessive interference can endanger the security of the economic processes on which the material well-being of the population depends.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Militarization and Visualization of Space is a Strategy Which Simultaneously Supports Militarism and Capitalist Expansion—Beginning From the Question of Visibility is a Superior Strategy to the Alternative</span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">These locative technologies are also crucial in the production of bricks’n’clicks assemblages of electronic and material provision in an augmented retail landscape. Corporations rely on connecting demands through to supply chains and, as supply chains lengthen and increase in complexity, the smooth flow of goods in response to demand has become a key issue for global capital. In this climate we can see the rise of technologies such as the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip. The various types of this device can be attached to just about anything and used to record or code its identity. More expensive variants allow these data to be modified to record the handling and processing of an object, and while the majority are ‘passive’ devices and wait until a reader comes within a few metres, some others are powered and actively broadcast information. For large corporations and logistical companies ‘RFID is a dream come true; a dream of controllability, transparency and efficiency as regards the worldwide tracing of goods’ (Kluitenbrouwer 2006, p. 51). If we take the RFID chips that allow recording, these create objects with memories, or indeed become SPIMES that are wholly trackable through their lives (Beer 2007), networked ‘blogjects’ that may be connected up and called forth to compose a ‘life log’ (Dodge &amp; Kitchin 2007). Bleecker’s (2006) notion of the ‘blogject’ is an artefact that develops data through tracing its use or movement. In this he takes forward the notion of the ‘Internet of Things’ from ‘a nascent conceptual framework for understanding how physical objects, once networked and imbued with informatic capabilities, will occupy space and occupy themselves in a world in which things were once quite passive’ to one that sees things as fully agentive players (Bleecker 2006, pp. 1–2). Blogjects move from being artefacts coded with data, through those periodically connected to wider systems by users (such as invehicle maintenance logs), those that communicate themselves among a limited system without user intervention (such as in car computerized control systems) and finally to rhizomic blogjects (such as a Blackberry) that can only function in a network as they use and store data off site. Such devices mean pervasive environments may produce seamless data trails across a number of devices. We have a combination of technologies [that] constitute ‘history-enriched’ digital objects that can produce autobiographical traces some of which objects are supplemented with profiling programmes that adapt them to personal preferences (eg, automatic interface customisation, predictive texting on mobile phones, etc) and thus learn or build in anticipation as well as memory. These automated forms of datalogging and personalization are being complemented by technologies for the conscious self-creation and public sharing of these personal materials, for example, through blogging and webcams. (Dodge &amp; Kitchin 2007, p. 434) They build skeletal memories of our practices and lives. There are then clearly issues of who accesses and controls this assemblage of data. Indeed, the issue would seem to be not one of blanket privacy but control over interchange of information where people want the benefits of tailored products but to do this by selecting which information is given to and received from whom (Kluitenbrouwer 2006). Illustrations of how they work might be the trial Developed Area Information service in the Roppongi Hills complex in Tokyo, where with ‘Mite Toru Click’ billboards are enabled via RFID chips to be clicked upon by a DoCoMo mobile phone to log the product, outlets and receive information. It boasts the ‘Buratto Catch’ system where users are emailed information about areas they enter, tailored in light of their past preference. More widely ‘uh Town’ pedestals in front of stores enable shoppers to log the location for future reference – a development from the QR system in Japan where camera phones read barcodes. A project echoing this in the West is the Windows Mobile application AURA launched in December 2006. The acronym stands for Advanced User Resource Annotation and it aims to ‘connect shoppers on the go to a world of information about products’ (MS press release). It depends upon objects being ‘coded’, in this case with a bar code. With an AURA-enabled device, you use a digital camera to snap the bar code on a product, which it will relate to the database held by Microsoft and will return links and search results about the item to the handheld device. Initially this could be as simple as an on-the-go product price comparison service but Microsoft hopes everyday users will eventually augment the information AURA delivers by posting reviews and other details about things they buy or own. Microsoft’s in-house anthropologist Marc Smith suggests AURA offers ‘a little taste of what the future will be like when you can walk up to any device and interrogate it and annotate it’ (Smith 2006). Conversely, in this world objects you cannot code become mute and people invisible. Already a scheme named ThingLink (Kluitenbrouwer 2006, pp. 55–56) aims to help handicraft producers to give any object a digital reference on an online database to make them visible to Google and other e-commerce portals. In other words, things which are not coded start to become literally dumb. And among those uncoded things may well be people. ‘From the perspective of these emergent forms of ambient intelligence, unwired humans will come across as singularly unintelligent, nonconversant and incomprehensible’ (Andrejevic 2005, p. 103). Indeed, the overall logic of this ‘m-commerce’ might be said to be about delegated agency and moving agency away from people – creating not heightened frenetic communication but new forms of passivity (Andrejevic 2005, p. 101). Distributed processors will increasingly recall our lives, the traces of our movement and use that to anticipate what we might later do. However, this seems in some ways like a mythic world that has been heralded before and where previous attempts have had very low uptake – something Microsoft argues was because of inadequate technology when people were not regularly carrying portable devices with the processing power, wireless connectivity and cameras to make such a service feasible and easy. In both these senses, the desire to track people and the mythology of a complete vision, we want to suggest there are striking parallels with recent plans and developments in the militarization of urban space. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It still seems to me that Virno’s claim is wrong in at least one sense. Biopolitics/biopower did not originate with capitalism. Certainly not in Agamben’s sense (”power over life” or something like that), and not in Foucault’s sense either. Foucault does link what he’s talking about with the origin of capitalism, but for Foucault biopower/biopolitics (bracketing for now the differences between Agamben and Foucault) helps explain capitalism’s origins, rather than capitalism explaining the origin of biopolitics. Foucault identifies one phase of what he’s on about as corresponding “to the need to form a “labor force” and to ensure its reproduction. The second phase corresponds to that epoch of Spatkapitalismus [late capitalism - should be an umlaut over the first “a”] in which the exploitation of wage labor does not demand the same violent and physical constraints as in the nineteenth century.” (114.)</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Negative Position Creates a Fantasy of Non-Productive Productivity—The World of Their Alternative is Precisely a Creation of Capitalism that Thwarts Effective Resistance</span></strong><br />

<br />
What Marx overlooked is that, to put it in the standardDerridean terms, this inherent obstacle/antagonism as the &quot;condition of impossibility&quot; of the full deployment of the productive foroes is simultaneously its &quot;condition of possibility&quot;: if we abolish the obstacle, the inherent contradiction of capitalism, we do not get the fully unleashed drive to product- ivity finally delivered of its impediment, but we lose precisely this productivity that seemed to be generated and simultaneously thwarted by capitalism - if we take away the obstade, the very potential thwarted by this obstacle dissipates Therein would reside a possible Lacanian critique of Marx, focusing on the ambiguous overlapping between surplus-value and surplus-enjoyment. So the critics of Com- munism were in a way right when they claimed that Marxian Communism is an impossible fantasy - what they did not perceive is that Marxian Communism, this notion of a society of pure unleashed productivity outside the frame of capital, was a fantasy inherent to capitalism itself, the capitalist inherent transgression at its purest, a strictly ideological fantasy of maintaining the thrust to productivity generated by capital- ism, while getting rid of the &quot;obstacles&quot; and antagonisms that were - as the sad experience of the &quot;really existing capital- ism&quot; demonstrates - the only possible framework of the effective materiaI existence of a society of permanent self-enhancing productivity.<br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Capital Focus of Your Impact Arguments Obscures the Totality of Power, Make it Impossible to Resist Other Forms of Violence, Ignoring the Historical Development of Different Forms of Governmentality </span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As Foucault's early accounts of governmentality indicate, and as the extension and application of it subsequently have also shown, the genealogy of global liberal governance is thus much more varied and diverse than its public claims to a Kantian heritage especially would imply.[14] To say that it is capitalist economically as much as it is liberal politically and corporately technocratic scientifically, and that this presents a powerful brew of social, political, economic, and military forces that radically exceed the liberal account of both power and of politics, is to pose more questions than these phrases answer. Neither capitalism, liberalism, nor science are simply what they proclaim themselves to be, or what they were once said to be. Each has mutated locally and globally in dramatic fashion as studies in the history of science, the history of economics, and the genealogy of governance indicate. Neither are such dynamic enterprises effectively held to account through the application and operation of the classic liberal distinctions between public-private, civil-military, national-international, scientific-industrial, and knowledge-power. Rather, they are obscurely combined in the globally dynamic military-industrial-scientific complexes of the so-called network societies and knowledge-based economies of contemporary liberal societies that problematize the democratizing claims of global civil society as much as they do the pacifying effects of cosmopolitan law.[15] Together, these liberal complexes now comprise an extraordinary regime of power/knowledge that has been disseminated as much globally as it has been intensified locally. It constitutes a regime of global power that significantly exceeds the Kantian heritage ontologically as much as it does epistemologically. To the extent that it does so, that tradition is an increasingly unreliable guide to global liberal governance's operation politically and economically. No longer exclusively or even primarily legislative in their form, the politics of the elite, the media, and money also dominate civil institutions in ways that systematically undermine liberalism's standards of disinterestedness epistemologically, as much as they do its claim to effect representative and accountable government politically.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We Have a Unique Turn to Your Alternative—We are All Bad Players, Deleuze’s Alternative is a an Attempt to Master the Dice Roll and Exclude Negativity—You Should Vote Affirmative to Truly Affirm Chance, Rather than Rushing Towards Sameness in the Guise of Alterity</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Derrida also has reservations about such bad players. Similarly, he is suspicious of those who attempt to predict, calculate or determine a horizon for our being, ‘a limit from which I pre-comprehend the future’ (Derrida and Ferraris 2001, 20). Derrida often identifies this inclination to pre-comprehend and thus deny the future as a form of messianism, a desire to identify what is ‘to come’ with a particular doctrine or message: ‘the distinguishing feature of any messianism is that it determines the figure of the Messiah, gives the Messiah a determinate characterization and specific configuration’ (Caputo 1997, 161). In response, Derrida proposes the image of the messianic, not a person or even a doctrine, but an impossible figure whose coming must always be awaited: the messianic is nothing other than a relation to the future so despoiled and indeterminate that it leaves being ‘to come’, i.e. undetermined. As soon as a determinate outline is given to the future, to the promise, even to the Messiah, the messianic loses its purity. (Derrida and Ferraris 2001, 21) The idea of a purely undetermined future ‘to come’ which must be awaited for patiently, openly and generously (without determination or pre-conception) works its way through a lot of Derrida’s thinking on friendship (1997), democracy (Derrida et al. 1994) and reason (2005) and, at first glance, it effectively reiterates Deleuze’s thinking on the eternal return, the dice throw and the fate of eternal destruction it binds us in. Yet, there is an important difference. In Derrida, the orientation towards the future that the Messianic represents is one that is never fulfilled. The Messiah can never arrive, she is never actualised and, thus, is an impossible figure. And yet we should wait. Thus, unlike Deleuze, Derrida’s future is not something we rush towards affirmatively, but rather something we wait for – generously, openly, hospitably if we can – but its arrival would be disastrous. The future for Derrida is an anxiety ‘we wait for something we would not like to wait for’ (Caputo 1997, 162). Thus, the point of waiting, of being open and generous towards the ‘coming’ of the future, is not a love of chance but is an ethical political gesture to be open to the disruptive power of otherness that haunts and infests every event. This distinction between Derrida’s and Deleuze’s orientation towards the future can, to some extent, be explained by their differing understandings of the event. In Deleuze, the engine for an event is another event – we throw the dice, a combination happens (posing problems and questions), we throw again. While the event is infused with new possibilities emerging from the charged chaos of the game, the game itself is sequential – an event happens, and then new problems emerge and then we throw again. An event’s opening is precipitated by the previous event’s completion, each unfolding moment relying on what came before, each evolution having its own timely order. In Derrida, however, the engine for the event is the other, or the wholly other, the unexpected and the impossible that ‘ perhaps ’ might be possible. In Derrida, we throw again because we are not convinced. The throw is never completed, it is always haunted by the possibility of something else, something more, something coming, that arrives suddenly and at any time. For Deleuze (like Nietzsche), the dice throw is positive and affirmative and negativity only enters the game through the bad player and resentful machines that attempt to manage it. In Derrida, however, there is a present non-presence beyond the game, an unnerving possibility of something wholly unexpected, an unknowable future, a silent perhaps whispering in the player’s ear and it is this anxiety that characterises and possibilitates every throw: There is no future and no relation to the coming of the event without experience of the ‘perhaps’ . . . the event belongs to a perhaps that is in keeping not with the possible but with the impossible. And its force is therefore irreducible to the force or the power of a performative event if it gives to the performative itself, to what is called the force of the performative, its chance and its effectiveness. (Derrida 2002, 235) The perhaps (the impossible possibility) gives to the dice throw (the performative event) its ‘chance and effectiveness’. Each throw inherits what has been made possible by the previous throw, but it also inherits the perhaps – the possibility of what comes. And it is the latter of these that makes us throw. For Derrida, we are all bad players. We throw the dice not only to actualise possibilities but to create them. To engender possibilities that can be actualised in the face of what cannot be seen. It is not that we do not love fate or resent the future. It is rather that we are anxious. We hear the call of an irruptive other who cannot be met (positively, affirmatively) but must be awaited.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A Nietszschean Society Avoids Any Potential Check on Cruelty—You Don’t Have to Advocate it, Mere Complicity and Tolerance Should Be Evaluated as the Equivalent Decision—The Ultimate Drive for Self Preservation Culiminates in Violence</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">May, College Research Fellow in Philosophy @ Birkbeck College, 99 (Simon, “Nietzsche’s ethic versus ‘morality’: The new ideal,” Nietzsche’s Ethics and his War on ‘Morality,’ P. 132-133)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">An apologist for Nietzsche might suggest that his ethic is not alone in effectively legitimizing inhumanity. He might argue, for example, that some forms of utilitarianism could not prevent millions being sacrificed if greater numbers could thereby be saved; or that heinous maxims could be consistently universalized by Kant's Categorical Imperative—maxims against which Kant's injunction to treat all human beings as ends in themselves would afford no reliable protection, both because its conception of 'humanity' is vague and because it would be overridden by our duty, as rational agents, to respect just such universalized maxims. To this apologist one would reply that with Nietzsche there is not even an attempt to produce a systematic safety net against cruelty, especially if one judges oneself to be a 'higher' type of person with life-enhancing pursuits—and, to this extent, his philosophy licenses the atrocities of a Hitler even though, by his personal table of values, he excoriates anti-Semitism and virulent nationalism. Indeed, to that extent it is irrelevant whether or not Nietzsche himself advocates violence and bloodshed or whether he is the gentle person described by his contemporaries. The reality is that the supreme value he places on individual life-enhancement and self-legislation leaves room for, and in some cases explicitly justifies, unfettered brutality. In sum: the point here is not to rebut Nietzsche's claim that 'everything evil, terrible, tyrannical in man' serves his enhancement 'as much as its opposite does' (BGE, 44—my emphasis)—for such a rebuttal would be a major ethical undertaking in its own right. It is rather to suggest that the necessary balance between danger and safety which Nietzsche himself regards as a condition for flourishing (for example, in this quote from BGE, 44) is not vouchsafed by his extreme individualism. Indeed, such individualism seems not only self-defeating, but also quite unnecessary: for safeguards against those who have pretensions to sovereignty but lack nobility could be accepted on Nietzsche's theory of value as just another 'condition for the preservation' of 'higher' types. Since the overriding aim of his attack on morality is to liberate people from the repressiveness of the 'herd' instinct, this unrelieved potential danger to the 'higher' individual must count decisively against the success—and the possibility of success—of his project.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Your Assumption of the Naturality of War Mistakes the Psyche for Socially Conditioned Phenomena—Rather than Embrace the Racist and Imperialist Drive for War We Should Redirect the Energy Necessarily Involved in the Alternative to Reduce Violence</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Stuhr 8—Professor of Philosophy and American Studies, and Chair, Department of Philosophy at Emory University (John J, “A Terrible Love of Hope”, The Journal of Speculative Philosophy New Series, Volume 22, Number 4, Project Muse, JB)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If concrete cases of love of hope and peace point toward, and result from, both self and societal transformation, so too do concrete cases of love of war. We may discipline ourselves to become more loving or more hateful. We may engage in social action to foster harmony or conflict. Recognizing this fact, we should not only strive to eliminate love of war through inward-bound self-transformation or outward-bound societal reconstruction. Hillman argues that this is impossible, and whether it is necessarily impossible, as he says, or just contingently impossible, neither of these strategies has worked so far. Instead, we should focus on changing the conditions that call forth action on behalf of love of war—and thereby change the consequences of love of war. In other words, if a healthy dose of realism suggests that we cannot eliminate love of war, then a healthy dose of meliorism suggests that we need to work to (1) reduce—not eliminate, but reduce—its manifestations or outbreaks and (2) redirect its energy. Let me expand on these two points. In the first place, then, we need to focus on the signs in our experience that love of war is moving us toward acts of war. What are these signs? They include at least the following six features of experience: mdash a morality of fundamentalist dualisms and absolutes: experiences of sharply separate and complete goods and complete evils, of self and radical other, of us and them, of good guys in a shining city on the hill and white hats and evil empires, of our benevolence and their arrogance and humiliation of us, of the outwardly same actions by us as justified and by them as unjust mdash a unique temporality: experiences that things are different or unique or special now, that a final moment has been entered and that we are tested by it, that we must respond right now fully and finally, that their actions must not be allowed to pass, that we have come to a turning point, that there is no going back, that it is now or never and that the past has come to an end mdash an exceptional metaphysics: experiences that God and history are with us; that we are chosen or exceptional or highest; that we are more than just another group striving to respond to our problems and advance our interests; that our interests, above all others, are Real or True or Holy mdash a projected transformation: experiences of anticipation and expectation that everything that really matters will be different—depending on what we do [End Page 285] now; that we stand at a threshold of possible irreversible triumph, glory, and salvation; that a qualitatively different future is about to dawn mdash a single-mindedness: experiences of narrowed focus and realization, finally, of what alone matters; of everything else as secondary and unimportant; of this alone as one's calling and meaning of life; of what one was born for, made for, prepared for; of one's destiny mdash the impossibility of communication: experiences that we cannot talk with them, that our truths permanently cut us off from their lies, that we can understand them but that they cannot understand us, that without our direct experience and our identity outsiders can never understand us, that deliberation and understanding are impossible and pointless and even demeaning13 These and related experiences, rooted in a love of war, are not merely &quot;natural.&quot; Instead, they can be, and are, manufactured and manipulated and deployed. Today we have learned that Hermann Göring was right that it is easy for leaders to drag the people to war: &quot;All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.&quot; Accordingly, those who hope for peace must invent democratic practices and institutions that mediate, intervene, and educate for different, fundamentally opposite experiences and policies. The politics of any effective love and hope for peace must be, in the broadest sense of the term, educational. The love of war, William James notes, is a love of meaningful and strenuous service to, and pride in, a collectivity. Noting that &quot;no collectivity is like an army for nourishing such pride,&quot; James nonetheless melioristically maintains that &quot;the martial type of character can be bred without war.&quot;14 How? James says in response that &quot;a permanently successful peace-economy cannot be a simple pleasure-economy&quot; and that, instead, &quot;new energies and hardihoods must transform &quot;the manliness to which the military mind so faithfully clings.&quot; He continues: &quot;The war-function has graspt us so far; but constructive interests may some day seem no less imperative and impose on the individual a hardly lighter burden.&quot;15 What constructive interests? James focuses on lives of little or nothing else but suffering imposed by accidents of birth, position, and opportunity—a general stance that dovetails nicely with many contemporary concerns about class and economic colonialism, nation and hemisphere, race and ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation, disability and disease, human rights and environmental justice.</span><br />

Crime, and more specifically the motive-less crime, served as the fulcrum upon which psychology balanced. The penal system, which felt the greatest threat by crime and more specifically the motiveless crime because it was to the penal system that one appealed to when the social contract had been broke. But, if there is no intention to break the social contract, but rather, only an intention to live in accordance with one's own personal constructs and nature, then the penal system does not have clear recourse since this person clearly does not work within the same paradigm. So, we see the case of Louis XVI manifesting itself in so many areas of the medico-legal system. For if someone never prescribed to the social contract in the first place, they would have to be dealt with by individuals and not by a multitude or sociality. However, instead of resorting to individuals becoming vigilantes psychology was crowned with the burden and privilege of mitigating essentially all court proceedings, if the issue of the nature of the criminal, or the culpability or sanity of the criminal, is brought to light. This was the enthronement of psychology, as we know it, in the penal system.&quot;Psychiatry set itself this kind of test of recognition of its royalty, of its sovereignty, of its knowledge and power: I can identify and illness; I can discover the signs of what has never been recognized. Imagine a crime that is unforeseeable, but which could be recognized as the particular sign of madness that a doctor could diagnose and foresee. Give it to me, says psychiatry, I can recognize a motiveless crime, a crime that is therefore the absolute danger, hidden deep in the body of society. If I can analyze a motiveless crime, then I will be queen&quot; (Foucault,122).What mechanisms are at work though, in understanding this particular kind of self-fulfillment and designation of psychology as dealing with crime and criminal nature? It means that as a agent of public hygiene, and now very explicitly of general public safety as well, psychology must begin to define abnormality. What follows from this, and all the events leading up to the &quot;enthronement&quot; of psychology has yielded what we understand today to be psychopathology. </span><br />

This peculiarity ultimately destroys the understanding of the political as based on and circumscribed by the friend/enemy division. The idea of an order of the political presupposes that the enemies of the order as such—that is, the enemy configuration that can overthrow a given order, or even the very idea of an order of the political—are generated from the inside: enemies of the order are not properly external enemies. This is so because the order of the political, as a principle of division, as division itself, always already regulates, and thus subsumes, its externality: externality is produced by the order as such, and it is a function of the order. Or rather: a principle of division can have no externality. Beyond the order, there can be enemies, if attacked, but they are not necessarily enemies of the order: they are simply ignorant of it.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">At the highest level of the political, at the highest level of the friend/ enemy division, there where the very existence of a given order of the political is at stake, the order itself secretes its own enmity. Enmity does not precede the order: it is in every case produced by the order. The friend/enemy division is therefore a division that is subordinate to the primary ordering division, produced from itself. The friend/enemy division is therefore not supreme: a nomic antithesis generates it, and thus stands above it. The [End Page 79] order of the political rules over politics. The political ontology implied in the notion of an order of the political deconstructs the political ontology ciphered in the friend/enemy division, and vice versa. They are mutually incompatible. Either the friend/enemy division is supreme, for a determination of the political, or the order of the political is supreme. Both of them cannot simultaneously be supreme. The gap between them is strictly untheorizable. If the friend/enemy division obtains independently of all the other antitheses as politically primary, then there is no order of the political. If there is an order of the political, the order produces its own political divisions. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Similarly to Mouffe, Slavoj Zizek’s engagement with Schmitt is motivated by the assumption of the relevance of the latter’s critique of liberalism in the contemporary context of depoliticisation: ‘the reference to Schmitt is crucial in detecting the deadlocks of post-political liberal tolerance.’ 13 Moreover, avoiding Mouffe’s misreading of Schmitt as an essentialist, Zizek emphasizes the purely formal and radically undecidable character of the friend-enemy distinction. At the same time, in his effort of rethinking Schmitt’s concept of the political Zizek does not seek, as Mouffe does, to mitigate its violent potential but rather to radicalize it even further: ‘[S]chmitt’s well-known answer, radical as it may appear, is not radical enough, insofar as it already displaces the inherent antagonism constitutive of the political on to the external relationship between Us and Them.’ 14 In accordance with his own Hegelian-Lacanian ontological stance, which became ever more pronounced in The Parallax View, Zizek views political antagonism as strictly internal and constitutive of the social order itself, rather than as a clash between preconstituted forms of order. 15 Every positive order is ontologically split from within and different from itself, and it is to this constitutive antagonism that the name ‘the political’ must, according to Zizek, be given. With a reference to the work of Badiou and Ranciere that anticipates our argument below, Zizek finds ontic manifestations of this ontological crack within a social order in confrontations between the positively structured social body, in which all elements are assigned a determinate locus, and the excluded singular elements that find no particular representation within this body and, for this very reason, are able to stand in for the Universal, no longer conceived as a harmonious unity of particular identities but rather as a violent disruption of every structured social order. It is this vision of ‘the political proper’ 16 that Zizek advocates as an alternative to Schmitt’s own concept, which he considers to be ‘the most cunning and radical version of [the] disavowal’ of the constitutive antagonism and labels ‘ultra-politics’. 17 In contrast to other forms of disavowal, enumerated by Zizek (the arche-politics of organic traditionalism, the para-politics of reducing political antagonism to the models of ‘competition’ or ‘discussion’, the meta-politics of conceiving of this antagonism as an epiphenomenon of extra-political processes and the post-politics of technocratic administration, supplemented by the ‘returns of the repressed’ in the form of racism and religious fundamentalism), ultra-politics consists in the reinscription of the internal political antagonism into a conflict between the inside and the outside: In ultra-politics, the ‘repressed’ political returns in the guise of the attempt to resolve the deadlock of political conflict by its false radicalisation – by reformulating it as a war between Us and Them, our enemy, where there is no common ground for symbolic conflict. […] The clearest indication of this Schmittian disavowal of the political is the primacy of external politics (relations between sovereign states) over internal politics (inner social antagonism) on which he insists. </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Your Argument Begins From the Wrong Question—Focusing on the Question of the Institution Means an Inattention to Power Relations, The Interrallocation of Power and Knowledge Means that Our Aff is a Pre-Requisite to the Alternative</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">John D. Caputo and Mark Yount, Villanova University, St. Joseph’s University, “Institutions, Normalization, and Power.” Foucault and the Critique of Institutions. 1993 (no page)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The connection between Foucault and institutions seems an obvious one, but not because he wanted to make the institution the basic unit of analysis. On the contrary, Foucault situated institutions within the thin but all-entangling web of power relations. He did so explicitly in Discipline and Punish, and he subsequently read his later analysis between the lines of his earlier works. In this genealogy, institutions are the more readily definable macro-objects, grosser instruments for the finer, more elemental workings of power. Power is the thin, inescapable film that covers all human interactions, whether inside institutions or out. Institutional structures are saturated with sexual relations, economic relations, social relations, etc., and are always established of these power relations: relations between men and women, old and young, senior and junior, well-born and starved, colorless and colored, Occident and Orient. Institutions are the means that power uses, and not the other way around, not sources or origins of power. The analysis of power is thus always more fine-grained than any analysis of classes, of states, or of institutions in their own terms would be. That is why for Foucault--and for all of the studies that follow here--the workings of power cannot be described from the standpoint of a master discipline, especially a perspective that would seek an origin for power, or take political power to be its initial or privileged form. It is always a question of analyzing institutions from the standpoint of power, and not of analyzing power from the standpoint of institutions.'</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">But we ought not to speak of power in the substantive, for there is no such thing. Instead, sets of &quot;power relations&quot; bathe the structures and edifices of human life, without power ever amounting to a thing or substance. It is not the very substance- and- subject of the historical process, like the Hegelian spirit, not the driving movement of contradictory social relations, as in Marx, not the unifying- gathering power that holds sway over all in Heidegger's history of Being. (The similarities might not be entirely accidental, though: see Mohanty's paper herein, 'Foucault as Philosopher, 1) Power is not one thing, but multiple and multiplied, scattered and disseminated.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Strategy of the Negative Prioritizes the Discourse and Notion of Sexuality as the Category of Analysis—As Such It Ignores the Prior Question of Power’s Construction of Bodies, Sexualities and Instantiates Sex as the Only Mode of Intelligibiltiy</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Judith Butler, Johns Hopkins University, “Sexual Inversions,” Foucault and the Critique of Institutions. 1993</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">How does this inversion from early to late modern power affect Foucault's discussion of yet another inversion, that between sex and sexuality) Within ordinary language we sometimes speak, for instance, of being a given sex, and having a certain sexuality, and we even presume for the most part that our sexuality in some way issues from that sex, is perhaps an expression of that sex, or is even partially or fully caused by that sex. Sexuality is understood to come from sex, which is to say that the biological locus of 11 sex' in and on the body is somehow conjured as the originating source of a sexuality that, as it were, flows out from that locus, remains inhibited within that locus, or somehow takes its bearings with respect to that locus. In any case, &quot;sex&quot; is understood logically and temporally to precede sexuality and to function, if not as its primary cause, then at least as its necessary precondition.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">However, Foucault performs an inversion of this relation and claims that this inversion is correlated with the shift from early to late modern power. For Foucault, &quot;it is apparent that the deployment of sexuality, with its different strategies, was what established this notion of 'sex'.&quot;' Sexuality is here viewed as a discursively constructed and highly regulated network of pleasures and bodily exchanges, produced through prohibitions and sanctions that quite literally give form and directionality to pleasure and sensation. As such a network or regime, sexuality does not emerge from bodies as their prior cause; sexuality takes bodies as its instrument and its object, the site at which it consolidates, networks, and extends its power. As a regulatory regime, sexuality operates primarily by investing bodies with the category of sex, that is, making bodies into the bearers of a principle of identity. To claim that bodies are one sex or the other appears at first to be a purely descriptive claim. For Foucault, however, this claim is itself a legislation and a production of bodies, a discursive demand, as it were, that bodies become produced according to principles of heterosexualizing coherence and integrity, unproblematically as either female or male. Where sex is taken as a principle of identity, it is always positioned within 11 held of two mutually exclusive and fully exhaustive identities; one is either male or female, never both at once, and never neither one of them.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Foucault writes the notion of sex brought about a fundamental reversal; it made it possible to invert the representation of the relationships of power to sexuality, causing the latter to appear, not in its essential and positive relation to power, but as being rooted in a specific and irreducible urgency which power tries as best it can to dominate; thus the idea of &quot;sex&quot; makes it possible to evade what gives &quot;power&quot; its power; it enables one to conceive power solely as law and taboo.'</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">For Foucault, sex, whether male or female, operates as a principle of identity that imposes a fiction of coherence and unity on an otherwise or unrelated set of biological functions, sensations, pleasures. Under the regime of sex, every pleasure becomes symptomatic of &quot;sex,&quot;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">&quot;sex&quot; itself functions not merely as the biological ground or cause of</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">but as that which determines its directionality, a principle of</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">teleology or destiny, and as that repressed, psychical core that furnishes c clues to the interpretation of its ultimate meaning. As a fictional imposition of uniformity, sex is &quot;an imaginary point&quot; and an &quot;artificial unity, but as fictional and as artificial, the category wields enormous power ' Although Foucault does not quite claim it, the science of reproduction produces intelligible &quot;sex&quot; by imposing a compulsory heterosexuality on the description of bodies. One might claim that sex is here according to a heterosexual morphology.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The category of &quot;sex&quot; thus establishes a principle of intelligibility for human beings, which is to say that no human being can be taken to be is human, unless that being is fully and coherently marked by sex And yet it would not capture Foucault's meaning merely to claim that there are humans who are marked by sex and thereby become intelligible. The point is stronger: to qualify as legitimately human, one must be coherently sexed. The incoherence of sex is precisely what marks off the abject and the dehumanized from the recognizably human.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">‘‘Non-Integrating’’ areas are those which are, in the words of Barnett (2004: 8), ‘‘disconnected from the global economy and the rule sets that define its stability’’. But disconnection is not only a ‘‘problem’’ for these societies alone ‘‘In this century, it is disconnectedness that defines danger. Disconnectedness allows bad actors to flourish by keeping entire societies detached from the global community and under their control. Eradicating disconnectedness, therefore, becomes the defining security task of our age’’ (Barnett, 2004: 8). </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Disconnection from the global community e or, as Roberts et al. (2003) argue, the global economy e also brings with it disconnection from the ‘‘rule sets’’ governing ‘‘proper’’ international behaviour: ‘‘enunciating that rule set is the most immediate task in this global war on terrorism, and promoting the global spread of that security rule set through our use of military force overseas (e.g. pre-emptive war against regimes that openly transgress the rule set) is our most important long-term goal in this struggle’’ (Barnett, 2004: 25). As noted above, the American role I the enunciation of a new ‘‘global rule set’’ has been the guiding preoccupation of the Project for the New American Century since its inception: a preoccupation which has been materialized within a number of the National Security Strategies (including the most recent iteration issued in March 2006).</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It is far from a selfish task, however; Barnett argues that it is America’s ‘‘moral responsibility’’ to ‘‘share’’ the rule set: ‘‘[as] America seeks to export this new security rule set called preemptive war, we are very careful in making sure this strategic concept is correctly understood. In short, pre-emptive war is not a tool for reordering the Core’s security structure as some fear. Rather, it is an instrument by which the Core should collectively seek to extend its stable security rule set into the essentially lawless Gap’’ (Barnett, 2004: 7, 40).</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As for Robert Kagan, for Barnett the United States’ role is predicated upon, above all, a privileged knowledge of the rule sets (the ability to define ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘bad’’ states), a privileged understanding of ‘‘the ways the world works’’, but also the willingness to enforce those rule sets. America is the Gap’s Leviathan: ‘‘if other Core powers want a greater say in how we exercise that power, they simply need to dedicate enough defense spending to develop similar capabilities. Absent that, America earns a certain right for unilateralism in the Gap’’ (Barnett, 2004: 173, 174). Similarly echoing Robert Kagan’s dismissal of Europeans’ ‘‘Kantian illusions’’, Barnett is even more resolute in affirming that such ‘‘illusions’’ have no place in today’s chaotic and dangerous world. In justifying the United States resistance to the International Criminal Court, Barnett suggests that it is not a question of American ‘‘exceptionalism’’ but rather the fact ‘‘that America needs special consideration for the security roles it undertakes inside the Gap. In effect, we don’t want fellow Core members applying their Kantian rule sets to our behavior inside the Hobbesian Gap’’ (Barnett, 2004: 174). Barnett suggests that the stakes are high e ‘‘One of us must die. Either the Core assimilates the Gap, or the Gap divides the Core’’ e and that the only response is to exterminate the ‘‘cancer’’; shrink the gap and thus face up to the reality of the new world situation (Barnett, 2004: 249, 250). As Roberts et al. (2003: 888) suggest, this geopolitics of absolutes is at play beneath the talk of global integration and ‘‘neoliberal world vision’’.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Conflict is therefore inevitable: it is a foundational truth confirmed by the severed map. Barnett’s cartography thus serves as both a description of today’s world and a prescriptionfor its proper ordering. As Roberts et al. (2003: 890) argue, ‘‘the map is both that which it to be explained and the explanation itself, descriptive of the recent past and predictive of future action’’. Insecurity comes not from a specific threatening other but from all those unwilling to integrate; all those refusing their (prescribed) place on the map. As Monmonier puts it, the map’s ‘‘lines and labels not only rationalize the current [Iraqi] occupation.but also argue for future interventions throughout the Gap’’ (Monmonier, 2005: 222). This understanding was clearly articulated in Barnett’s first book (Barnett, 2004), but is even more explicit in the follow-up volume, revealingly entitled Blueprint for Action (Barnett, 2005). US interventions are thus presented as inevitable, until the messiness of the world is made to match the geometries of the Pentagon's new map.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This Methodology is a Pre-Requisite to Any of Your Arguments—We Must Begin With Analysis of Epistemological Truth, Rather than Simply Accept Them—Accepting the Negative’s Method or Lack of Method Makes Any Implementation Possible </span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Chris Calvert-Minor, “Archeology and Humanism: An Incongruent Foucault,” KRITIKE, JUNE 2010 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_7/calvert-minor_june2010.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_7/calvert-minor_june2010.pdf</a>)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Where Foucault uncovered the origination of specific concepts in his previous archaeological works (e.g., the concepts of madness and disease), in The Order of Things he shifts his attention to larger archaeological structures that underlie considerable expanses of time and distinguish themselves through comparative discursive discontinuities with adjoining periods. These larger structures are the epistemes of the time period, the total set of transversal unifying relations that constructs the knowledge infrastructure of a given time period in all of its aspects (subjects, disciplines, and systems) and constitutes its discursive regularities.11 The episteme is not the composition of extant knowledge; it is the set of conditions for the constitution of knowledge. Epistemes are temporally localized, not universal, so that ahistorical truths and concepts are jettisoned in favor of the “historical a priori,” where what counts as ‘true’ and ‘meaningful’ are given without dispute and determined by the epistemological possibilities generated. These rules of formation create the conditions for true discourse and meaningful language without necessitating the expression of any particular set of statements over another within the realm of epistemic possibility. Truth is not a transcendent reality; it is contemporaneous with discourse – immanent, yet logically prior, to discursive practices. Truth becomes historicized and changes with change in the episteme. This is, then, a defining difference between Foucault’s notion of the episteme and the tenets of structuralism. Epistemes are not immutable or universally static; they determine the possibilities of discourse at the micro level of specific practices and languages, but there remains a macroscopic indeterminate element across periods, which structuralists deny. The archaeological method for discovering epistemes is through the analysis of discourses and discourses alone. Documents become monuments for archaeological analysis, bifurcated from subjectivity and consciousness.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Foucault is only interested in the rules of formation, the games of truth and meaning, that immanently constitute the discourses and reveal the inner law of the episteme.12 Foucault does not wish to invoke the authority of a sovereign behind an oeuvre or relate archaeology to psychology or anthropology, disciplines that make human subjectivity the engine of human production.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Archaeology is a rewriting of what has already been written in a way that avoids the humanismm of most other historiographical recountings. Archaeological analysis means to be thoroughly anti-humanistm.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">These discursive practices are identified and subjected to comparative analyses with other discourses so that their differences are made manifest. In this sense, archaeology is always a study of plurality since the contours of difference are required, already implying disparate regularities between discourses. The archaeologist notes how the discourses distinguish themselves from other modes of discursive thought that make visible epistemological breaks. For Foucault, these analyses are genuine discoveries, rather than inventions, since the archaeologist must operate within a blank space that is defined by the “exteriority of its vicinity” in order to conduct an archaeological analysis.13 One cannot be influenced by the epistemic conditions one seeks to analyze; the archaeologist must remain externally neutral to the discursive concepts one studies in order to conduct a project of pure description. The archaeologist discovers the actual rules of formation immanent to the surface of discourse, rather than shaping the field of inquiry according to one’s own set of normative criteria, concepts, and projects.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">NATO’s members also differ on the means to respond to threats confronting the alliance. This was most apparent in the bitter dispute over the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. The dispute illustrated three points of disagreement. First, it rejected different understandings of the nature of the terrorist threat and how to combat it. Second, it exposed deep differences about the appropriate use of force, and in particular about the U.S. policy of preventive war. Whereas the United States insisted that the urgency of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein’s supposed possession of WMD mandated immediate action, several European allies argued that Hussein was contained and could be deterred. Third, the dispute illustrated increasing European concern about U.S. unilateralism and the fear that NATO’s European members might be “entrapped” by their alliance commitments to support a reckless military operation. 92 As a result, both France and Germany balked at supporting the United States.93 Although the Bush administration sought to repair relations with key European allies and institutions after the 2004 presidential elections, the acrimony caused by this dispute has left a residue of ill will. The shifting alignments and attitudes toward threats confronting NATO have reduced the United States’ willingness to accept alliance constraints.94 Moreover, the United States’ strategic focus has changed, with greater attention being given to the Middle East, Central Asia, and East Asia. This is evident both in the changing base deployments in Europe and the State Department’s decision to shift at least 100 diplomatic positions from Europe to other regions, including Africa, South Asia, East Asia, and the Middle East.95 This move is a logical step and if anything overdue, given the end of the Cold War, but it is telling of shifts in U.S. policy priorities. </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">ONLY PRIOR, BINDING CONSULTATION ENSURES GOOD RELATIONS WITH OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES – KEY TO MAINTAINING A STRONG ALLIANCE</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">GOLDGEIER AND SHERWOOD-RANDALL 2005 [James – adjunct senior fellow @ Institute for European Studies and Elizabeth – adjunct senior fellow for alliance relations @ Stanford University, FEDERAL NEWS SERVICE, February 18]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">MR. GOLDGEIER: Well, you know, I mean, part of the with us or against us that's been so important has been this notion of consultation means we tell you what our policy is and then, you know, you either agree, in which case we've consulted effectively, or you disagree, in which case we don't work with you on that particular issue. The Europeans have a different view of what that should look like, which is serious give and take in which the United States presents its ideas and the Europeans present their ideas and there is some effort to work through the different perspectives in trying to reach a common ground and forge ahead with policies to deal with common problems. And so the Europeans are -- the Europeans are eager to have this be a successful trip. so that's an important point. They want the president's visit to go well because the president had made the effort to say I'm reaching out to you. But they are also looking for a sign that the president is coming to really hear what they have to say and is interested in serious interaction and serious taking account of their views. As Liz said, on some of these other issues that have been so important to the Europeans, like the environment generally, climate change in particular, nobody's expecting Bush to say yes, we're joining Kyoto, but there is an expectation that he will -- he will reach out by showing that he takes the European position seriously and that he has an interest in working on this set of issues. And if the trip ends up being a repeat of what we saw in the first term, which is, &quot;here are our views, and we look forward to your accepting them,&quot; then it's not going to -- there won't be anything to build on. There really has to be an effort by the United States. And then in return, if Bush does really reach out in a more substantive way, the Europeans should not miss the opportunity to reach back. If they miss the opportunity, then they've really missed something significant. MS. SHERWOOD-RANDALL: I'd like to add to that. Can you just -- (comes on mike) -- yeah. I'll add to what Jim has said. First of all, I agree on the description of the content of consultations. The distinction for me is whether you go to inform or actually consult -- (chuckles) -- and I think the pattern of the last four years has been we inform you of our views, you're with us or against us. We're looking for real -- and I think the Europeans are looking for real -- listening and engagement. I mean, the tradition in the alliance, the alliance that worked for 50 years, was that we actually used the fora that we had built, both formal and informal mechanisms of dialogue, to reach agreement on the most contentious issues out of the limelight. And the whole purpose was that we would discuss and disagree, but not have a pissing match in public. And so the question is whether we can find some way to get back to a process in which we actually talk, listen and work out agreed positions on highly contentious issues. It continues… MS. SHERWOOD-RANDALL: This is the wrong group. But I would say, I mean, if you're looking at transatlantic relations, the important thing is with respect to an overall plan for reaching some -- for achieving progress on the Middle East peace front, I believe we should be doing what we have traditionally done with the Europeans, which is to go to Europe first, talk to our key allies about what we're thinking about doing, work out an agreed process that they are a part of it, and use our collective leverage to bring about results. So it's not about us going out first and then hoping people will come along, it's about going through Europe first. I mean, that's the big difference in psychology, is whether you choose to strengthen transatlantic ties as you pursue broader goals, or whether you go around Europe and expect people to either be with you or against you and bear the consequences of being against you, which was the first- term approach. My view is we are much more effective, much stronger, both in terms of our policies in the world and also the import of our relations with Europe, if we choose to go to Europe first. That needs to be a part of any action plan, is to consult first with our European allies bilaterally and multilaterally, in capitals and at NATO.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And yet, it is fair to ask: Is NATO living up to its extraordinary potential? NATO today is without a doubt the most powerful military and political alliance in the world. Its 28 members come from the globe's two most productive, technologically advanced, socially modern, economically prosperous, and politically democratic regions. Its member states' 900 million people account for only 13 percent of the world's population but 45 percent of global GDP. NATO's potential is not primarily military. Although NATO is a collective-security alliance, its actual military power comes predominantly from the United States, and that reality is not likely to change anytime soon. NATO's real power derives from the fact that it combines the United States' military capabilities and economic power with Europe's collective political and economic weight (and occasionally some limited European military forces). Together, that combination makes NATO globally significant. It must therefore remain sensitive to the importance of safeguarding the geopolitical bond between the United States and Europe as it addresses new tasks. The basic challenge that NATO now confronts is that there are historically unprecedented risks to global security. Today's world is threatened neither by the militant fanaticism of a territorially rapacious nationalist state nor by the coercive aspiration of a globally pretentious ideology embraced by an expansive imperial power. The paradox of our time is that the world, increasingly connected and economically interdependent for the first time in its entire history, is experiencing intensifying popular unrest made all the more menacing by the growing accessibility of weapons of mass destruction -- not just to states but also, potentially, to extremist religious and political movements. Yet there is no effective global security mechanism for coping with the growing threat of violent political chaos stemming from humanity's recent political awakening. The three great political contests of the twentieth century (the two world wars and the Cold War) accelerated the political awakening of mankind, which was initially unleashed in Europe by the French Revolution. Within a century of that revolution, spontaneous populist political activism had spread from Europe to East Asia. On their return home after World Wars I and II, the South Asians and the North Africans who had been conscripted by the British and French imperial armies propagated a new awareness of anticolonial nationalist and religious political identity among hitherto passive and pliant populations. The spread of literacy during the twentieth century and the wide-ranging impact of radio, television, and the Internet accelerated and intensified this mass global political awakening. In its early stages, such new political awareness tends to be expressed as a fanatical embrace of the most extreme ethnic or fundamentalist religious passions, with beliefs and resentments universalized in Manichaean categories. Unfortunately, in significant parts of the developing world, bitter memories of European colonialism and of more recent U.S. intrusion have given such newly aroused passions a distinctively anti-Western cast. Today, the most acute example of this phenomenon is found in an area that stretches from Egypt to India. This area, inhabited by more than 500 million politically and religiously aroused peoples, is where NATO is becoming more deeply embroiled. Additionally complicating is the fact that the dramatic rise of China and India and the quick recovery of Japan within the last 50 years have signaled that the global center of political and economic gravity is shifting away from the North Atlantic toward Asia and the Pacific. And of the currently leading global powers -- the United States, the EU, China, Japan, Russia, and India -- at least two, or perhaps even three, are revisionist in their orientation. Whether they are &quot;rising peacefully&quot; (a self-confident China), truculently (an imperially nostalgic Russia) or boastfully (an assertive India, despite its internal multiethnic and religious vulnerabilities), they all desire a change in the global pecking order. The future conduct of and relationship among these three still relatively cautious revisionist powers will further intensify the strategic uncertainty. Visible on the horizon but not as powerful are the emerging regional rebels, with some of them defiantly reaching for nuclear weapons. North Korea has openly flouted the international community by producing (apparently successfully) its own nuclear weapons -- and also by profiting from their dissemination. At some point, its unpredictability could precipitate the first use of nuclear weapons in anger since 1945. Iran, in contrast, has proclaimed that its nuclear program is entirely for peaceful purposes but so far has been unwilling to consider consensual arrangements with the international community that would provide credible assurances regarding these intentions. In nuclear-armed Pakistan, an extremist anti-Western religious movement is threatening the country's political stability. These changes together reflect the waning of the post-World War II global hierarchy and the simultaneous dispersal of global power. Unfortunately, U.S. leadership in recent years unintentionally, but most unwisely, contributed to the currently threatening state of affairs. The combination of Washington's arrogant unilateralism in Iraq and its demagogic Islamophobic sloganeering weakened the unity of NATO and focused aroused Muslim resentments on the United States and the West more generally.</span><br />

<strong>Status quo proletariat movements are gaining momentum and have the power to bring down capitalism and result in the removal of troops–these movements will only succeed if they remain based in labor and free from the state</strong><br />
Prof. Jose Maria Sison “WAR, IMPERIALISM AND RESISTANCE FROM BELOW” Speech to the Third Annual Conference Of the Global Studies Association, Chairman, Center for Social Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands Brandeis University, Boston, MA, USA<br />
24 April 2004<br />
<br />
We may count as forces of resistance from below those nonimperialist states that stand up to defend their national independence against imperialism. In fact the US has launched the most violent wars of aggression against such states, which have included Iraq, former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan in recent times. It has also emboldened and supported the Israeli Zionists to occupy Palestine and suppress the Palestinian resistance. As a consequence, we see the steady growth of armed and other forms of resistance in countries directly or indirectly attacked by the US.<br />
During the first quarter of 2003, we saw the rising of millions of people in hundreds of cities all over the world. The biggest was on February 15, when 30 million people rose up. The protest marches and rallies were reminiscent of those held at the peak of the people’s resistance to the Vietnam war in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<br />
The resurgence of mass protest actions against war and against imperialism in the imperialist countries reflects not only a high sense of solidarity of the people in such countries for other peoples but also the growing discontent over the crisis of the world capitalist system. The people are restive over high rates of unemployment, the reduction of social benefits, the deterioration of social services and the highest priority given to corporate benefits and to military spending.<br />
The Iraqi people are now waging a broad-based armed resistance against the US occupation and the puppets. The united front includes the bourgeois nationalists, communists, the Baathists, the Sunnis, Shiittes and other religious believers and the Arab, Kurdish, Turkomen and other ethnic communities. The tempo and scope of the revolutionary war for national liberation are increasing. The successful offensives of the Iraqi people are bound to inspire bigger protest actions in the US and in the world.<br />
The American and other peoples of the world are now demanding the withdrawal of US troops and bases from Iraq. The peaceful mass actions alone cannot compel the US to withdraw from Iraq. But as in the US war of aggression in Vietnam, the mounting US casualities in the Iraqi battlefield and the gigantic mass actions of the American and other peoples of the world can persuade the US to withdraw from Iraq.<br />
Throughout the world, the broad masses of the people have been roused by the exploitative character of “free market” globalization and by the oppressive character of “the new world order.” They detest and resist the ugly character and consequences of neoliberalism and neoconservatism. They are carrying out various forms of resistance, which are spreading and intensifying.<br />
The most effective and most promising kind of resistance are the revolutionary armed struggles being carried out in such countries as the Philippines, Turkey, Palestine, Iraq, Nepal, India and Colombia. There are also reemerging revolutionary forces of the oppressed nations and peoples that wish to wage armed revolution. The US is becoming more and more vulnerable as it is stricken by crisis and further strains itself through imperial overstretch. Thus, the number of people determined to wage armed revolution is rapidly increasing.<br />
It is self-defeating for the US to have used cruise missiles and other weapons of mass destruction to take out regimes that are opposed to it and also for it to have provocatively shown off its military presence in so many countries. The US has nearly exhausted its deployable military forces by being absorbed even only in the two countries of Iraq and Afghanistan. It has also become clear that hightech weapons are ineffective against people’s revolutionary forces that wage an armed resistance of fluid movement and offer no fixed targets to their enemy.<br />
The resistance from below from the toiling masses of workers and peasants is the strongest, most inexhaustible and most important kind of resistance. The toiling masses are ever willing and eager to resist the most intolerable forms of oppression and exploitation, now surfacing under the current crisis conditions. It can become sustained and well-directed and can advance from one stage to another only if there is a truly revolutionary party of the proletariat. The working class is still the principal agent for revolutionary change in the epochal struggle against imperialism in both the imperialist and dominated countries.<br />
So long as imperialism persists in oppressing and exploiting the people, the people’s struggle for national liberation, democracy and socialism will continue. US imperialism and the local exploiting classes themselves create the crisis conditions which generate the people’s resistance and pave the way for the revolutionary class and party leadership to arise. There is no stopping the wheels of history from moving, despite ny curve, bumps or zigzags along the way.<br />

<strong>A state policy cannot solve war or the environmental catastrophe–the aff’s policies are just excuses to continue our out of control consumerism. Continued growth is death, allowing the capitalist system to collapse is the only chance we have at survival.</strong><br />

PhD in land resources from Wisconson-Madison, Masters in &quot;Conservation Biology and Sustainable Development&quot;, and a BA in &quot;Political Science&quot; from Marquette University, President and Founder of Ecological Internet (EI).<br />
<br />
Besides being entirely inadequate in scale and ambition, what is most disconcerting about these green spending initiatives is the lack of ambitious ecologically based policies to provide context and support for the funding. There is a complete disregard for ecological science and what is known about the immediacy of threats to global ecological sustainability. The simplistic assumption is that simply throwing token money at global ecological crises while fundamentally changing very little else can return us to growth, provide jobs and is simultaneously the best way to save the Earth.<br />
We are not going to grow our way to ecological sustainability. Simply, a Green New Deal that focuses upon economic stimulus to promote more growth without providing the necessary additional supportive policies necessary to rein in consumption, natural resource use and ecosystem destruction will make things worse.<br />
In just over three hundreds years, the world has experienced explosive growth in population, consumption, resource extraction and loss of ecosystems. While heralded as progress by the elite and the temporarily burgeoning middle class, it has meant impoverishment and death for most others -- particularly of different colors and religions than the ecological imperialists. For every family able to fleetingly enjoy modern technological comforts, there have been many more that have had their persons violated and seen their land stolen, stripped of its life, and left barren. Billions live in extreme poverty on a dollar or two a day while an equal number panic as their excessive, conspicuous and destructive consumption falters.<br />
Industrial capitalism is based not only upon institutionalizing massive economic inequities; it is also dependent upon the three lies of endless: 1) growth, 2) extraction of resources from, and pollution into, natural ecosystems, and 3) technological innovations. It is supposed that technological solutions exist for any human ecological or social problem, and that we will be able to engineer a biosphere and its attendant ecological services including seasonality, rainfall, pollination and many others. In order to maximize profits for the few, the simple exchange of goods in markets has instead become a massive Ponzi scheme based upon liquidating ecosystems, exploiting others, and development of ever more arcane financial instruments detached from actual sustainable production of social goods.<br />
The house of cards is coming tumbling down. Perhaps by spending trillions to subsidize consumers to spend ever more to buy crap on credit they do not need, and that comes from destroying the Earth, a few more years of growth can be coaxed from further diminishing an exhausted Earth. But now, or in the near future, this ecologically terrible economic system is going to collapse. I have said it before and I repeat, if humanity and the Earth are to survive, it would be much better if the current system collapses sooner rather than later.<br />
Continued industrial and speculative capitalism is assured death. Given continued failure to have prices reflect environmental externalities, including assigning a price to carbon emissions, there is no reason to believe that capitalism's excesses can be reformed in time to maintain an operable biosphere.<br />
Obama's tepid climate policies including a cap and trade proposal, and renewable energy investments (while inexplicably continuing coal and tar sands), are being portrayed as allowing us to solve critical ecological issues while continuing to boost economic growth. We can have our cake and eat it too (now that is hope I can believe in)! Obama is doing nothing to change American history of unbridled, aggressive and speculative economic growth at the expense of natural ecosystems, which is precisely what brought us to this world of over-population, inequitable consumption, economic failure and ecosystem collapse in the first place. And he is definitely not acting with a sense of urgency to pursue sufficient policies such as a carbon tax.<br />
Again, please note the patently obvious observation that nothing grows forever, and trying always destroys the growing system and its surroundings. I cannot say it enough: the shared root of humanity's current ecological and economic crises is our addiction to growth -- namely economic, population and consumption on the basis of liquidation of natural capital. There is no indication that calls for a &quot;Green New Deal&quot; are concerned with fundamental, sufficient transformation required to bring human society into a steady state economy required to achieve and maintain global ecological sustainability.<br />
Paltry expenditures of less than 1% of GDP upon relatively ecologically sustainable economic activities, while allowing the other 99% of industrial activity to continue unreformed, will keep the emphasis for economic well-being on unsustainable growth. It will not even make a piddling contribution to stopping the habitat loss, ocean impoverishment, fouling of water, and collapsing atmosphere upon which all life depends.<br />
Indeed, by allowing the technocrats to steal our green rhetoric, the truly ecologically sufficient policies necessary -- returning to the land to protect and restore ecosystems, to save being while making an honest living from our hands and minds and surplus natural capital -- are put off until after it is almost certainly too late. Doing not enough, diverting from what must be done, is worse than doing nothing.<br />
Plans for green jobs and green stimulus, to simultaneously lift us from economic recession while pursuing climate change and other ecological policies, are doomed to failure if they are not accompanied by some additional fundamental transformations of the social and economic order. We know we must reduce human population and inequitable consumption. There is no future for logging old forests, burning coal or industrial agriculture including biofuels and biochar. And energy efficiency, conservation and renewables -- while we immediately end the use of fossil fuels and industrial biofuels -- are the only road to keeping the lights on, within a habitable Earth. We can pursue these sufficient ecological policies with a revolutionary spirit of action, or we can roll over and die. We still have the power and time to stop the ecological bubble, but just barely.<br />

<strong>The Temptation to Act is Basis of Capitalist Economics—Only By Embracing Criticism and Resisting the Call to Praxis Can We Put Up a Truly Radical Politix Which Stands a Chance Against Capital</strong><br />
ZIZEK 2004<br />
[Slavoj, Serbian Nationalist and Historical Revisionist, Revolution at the Gates, p. 169-171 <em>wyo-tjc]</em><br />
<br />
Indeed, since the “normal” functioning of capitalism involves some kind of disavowal of the basic principle of its functioning (today’s model capitalist is someone who, after ruthlessly generating profit, then generously shares parts of it, giving large donations to churches, victims of ethnic or sexual abuse, etc., posing as a humanitarian), the ultimate act of transgression is to assert this principle directly, depriving it of its humanitarian mask. I am therefore tempted to reverse Marx’s Thesis 11: the first task today is precisely not to succumb to the temptation to act, to intervene directly and change things {which then inevitably ends in a cul-de-sac of debilitating impossibility: “What can we do against global capital?”), but to question the hegemonic ideological co-ordinates. In short, our historical moment is still that of Adorno: to the Question “What should we do?” I can most often truly answer with “I don’t know.” I can only try to analyse rigorously what there is. Here people reproach me: When you practice criticism, you are also obliged to say how one should make it better. To my mind, this is incontrovertibly a bourgeois prejudice. Many times in history it so happened that the very works which pursued purely theoretical goals transformed consciousness and thereby also social reality. If, today, we follow a direct call to act, this act will not be performed in an empty space—it will be an act within the hegemonic ideological cooridinates: those who “really want to do something to help people” get involved in {undoubtedly honourable} exploits like Medecins sans frontiers, Greenpeace, feminist and anti-racist campaigns, which are all not only tolerated but even supported by the media, even if they seemingly encroach on economic territory (for example, denouncing and boycotting companies which do not respect ecological conditions, or use child labour) – they are tolerated and supported as long as they do not get too close to a certain limit. This kind of activity provides the perfect example of interpassivity? Of doing things not in order to achieve something, but to prevent something from really happening, really changing. All this frenetic humanitarian, politically correct, etc. activity fits the formula of “Let’s go on changing something all the time so that, globally, things will remain the same!” If standard cultural studies criticize capitalism, they do so in the coded way that exemplifies Hollywood liberal paranoia: the enemy is “the system”, the hidden “organization”, the anti-democratic “conspiracy” not simply capitalism and state apparatuses. The problem with this critical stance is not only that it replaces concrete social analysis with a struggle against abstract paranoic fantasies, but that – in a typical paranoic gesture – it unnecessarily redoubles social reality, as if there were a secret Organization behind the “visible” capitalist and state organs. What we should accept is that there is no need for a secret “organization-within-an-organization”: the “conspiracy” is already in the “visible” organization as such, in the capitalist system, in the way the political space and state apparatuses work.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, The Inertial Organization of Capital Means that the Permutation is Doomed—Any Residual Capitalist Organization Will Regenerate Itself Like the Hydra</strong><br />
<em>KOVEL (Alger Hiss Prof. At Bard) 2002</em> <em>[Joel, The Enemy of Nature, Zed Books, p. 142-3</em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
The value-term that subsumes everything into the spell of capital sets going a kind of wheel of accumulation, from production to consumption and back, spinning ever more rapidly as the inertial mass of capital grows, and generating its force field as a spinning magnet generates an electrical field. This phenomenon has important implications for the reformability of the system. Because capital is so spectral, and succeeds so well in ideologically mystifying its real nature, attention is constantly deflected from the actual source of eco-destabilization to the instruments by which that source acts. The real problem, however, is the whole mass of globally accumulated capital, along with the speed of its circulation and the class structures sustaining this. That is what generates the force field, in proportion to its own scale; and it is this force field, acting across the numberless points of insertion that constitute the ecosphere, that creates ever larger agglomerations of capital, sets the ecological crisis going, and keeps it from being resolved. For one fact may be taken as certain — that to resolve the ecological crisis as a whole, as against tidying up one corner or another, is radically incompatible with the existence of gigantic pools of capital, the force field these induce, the criminal underworld with which they connect, and, by extension, the elites who comprise the transnational bourgeoisie. And by not resolving the crisis as a whole, we open ourselves to the spectre of another mythical creature, the many-headed hydra, that regenerated itself the more its individual tentacles were chopped away.<br />
To realize this is to recognize that there is no compromising with capital, no schema of reformism that will clean up its act by making it act more greenly or efficiently We shall explore the practical implications of this thesis in Part III, and here need simply to restate the conclusion in blunt terms: green capital, or non-polluting capital, is preferable to the immediately ecodestructive breed on its immediate terms. But this is the lesser point, and diminishes with its very success. For green capital (or ‘socially/ecologically responsible investing’) exists, by its very capital-nature, essentially to create more value, and this leaches away from the concretely green location to join the great pool, and follows its force field into zones of greater concentration, expanded profitability — and greater ecodestruction.<br />

<strong>First—We Must Recognize that the Existence of the State and the Reproduction of the 1AC Harms are Based on the Operations of Capital, As Such Any Attempt to Take Radicalized Action in Either Domain is Ultimately Powerless</strong><br />
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 1995<br />
[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, <em>wyo]</em><br />
<br />
The modern state as the comprehensive political command structure of capital — is both the necessary prerequisite for the transformation of capital’s at first fragmented units into a viable system, and the overall framework for the full articulation and maintenance of the latter as a global system. In this fundamental sense the state on account of its constitutive and permanently sustaining role must be understood as an integral part of capital’s material ground itself. Or it contributes in a substantive way not only to the formation and consolidation of all of the major reproductive structures of society but also to their continued functioning. However, the close interrelationship holds also when viewed from the other side. For the modern state itself is quite inconceivable without capital as its social metabolic foundation. This makes the material reproductive structures of the capital system the necessary condition not only for the original constitution but also for the continued survival (and appropriate historical transformations) of the modern state in all its dimensions. These reproductive structures extend their Impact over everything, from the strictly material/repressive instruments cid juridical institutions of the state all the way to the most mediated ideological and political theorizations of its raison d’être and claimed legitimacy.<br />
It is on account of this reciprocal determination that we must speak of a close match between the social metabolic ground of the capital system on the one hand, and the modern state as the totalizing political command structure of the established productive and reproductive order on the other. For socialists this is a most uncomfortable and challenging reciprocity. It puts into relief the sobering fact that any intervention in the political domain — even when it envisages the radical overthrow of the capitalist state — can have only a very limited impact in the realization of the socialist project. And the other way round, the corollary of the same sobering fact is that, precisely because socialists have to confront the power of capital’s self-sustaining reciprocity under its fundamental dimensions, it should be never forgotten or ignored - although the tragedy of seventy years (if Soviet experience is that it had been willfully ignored — that there can be no chance of overcoming the power of capital without remaining faithful to the Marxian concern with the ‘withering away’ of the state.<br />

<strong>The Contemporary Attempt to Constitute Identity Without Regard to Structural Historicism is Precisely the Problem—Focus on Disciplinarily and the Biopolitical State Renaturalizes Capitalism and Ensures the Impossibility of Any Successful Challenge to Your Harms</strong><br />
<em>BROWN (Professor &amp; Genius) 1993</em> <em>[Wendy, “Wounded Attachments”, Political Theory, Aug. p. 392-394</em>wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
As liberal discourse converts political identity into essentialized private interest, disciplinary power converts interest into normativized social identity manageable by regulatory regimes. Thus disciplinary power politi- cally neutralizes entitlement claims generated by liberal individuation, whereas liberalism politically neutralizes rights claims generated by disciplinary identities. In addition to the formations of identity that may be the complex effects of disciplinary and liberal modalities of power, I want to suggest one other historical strand relevant to the production of politicized identity, this one hewn more specifically to recent developments in political culture. Although sanguine to varying degrees about the phenomenon they are describing, many on the European and North American Left have argued that identity politics emerges from the demise of class politics consequent to post-Fordism or pursuant to May 1968. Without adjudicating the precise relationship between the breakup of class politics and the proliferation of other sites of political identification, I want to refigure this claim by suggesting that what we have come to call identity politics is partly dependent on the demise of a critique of capitalism and of bourgeois cultural and economic values. In a reading that links the new identity claims to a certain relegitimation of capitalism, identity politics concerned with race, sexuality, and gender will appear not as a supplement to class politics, not as an expansion of Left categories of oppression and emancipation, not as an enriching complexification of pro- gressive formulations of power and persons-all of which they also are-but as tethered to a formulation of justice which, ironically, reinscribes a bour- geois ideal as its measure. If it is this ideal that signifies educational and vocational opportunity, upward mobility, relative protection against arbitrary violence, and reward in proportion to effort, and if it is this ideal against which many of the exclusions and privations of people of color, gays and lesbians, and women are articulated, then the political purchase of contemporary American identity politics would seem to be achieved in part through a certain discursive renaturalization of capitalism that can be said to have marked progressive discourse since the 1970s. What this suggests is that identity politics may be partly configured by a peculiarly shaped and peculiarly disguised form of resentment-class resent- ment without class consciousness or class analysis. This resentment is displaced onto discourses of injustice other than class but, like all resent- ments, retains the real or imagined holdings of its reviled subject-in this case, bourgeois male privileges-as objects of desire. From this perspective, it would appear that the articulation of politicized identities through race, gender, and sexuality require, rather than incidentally produce, a relatively limited identification through class. They necessarily rather than incidentally abjure a critique of class power and class norms precisely because the injuries suffered by these identities are measured by bourgeois norms of social acceptance, legal protection, relative material comfort, and social indepen- dence. The problem is that when not only economic stratification but other injuries to body and psyche enacted by capitalism (alienation, cornmodifica- tion, exploitation, displacement, disintegration of sustaining, albeit contra- dictory, social forms such as families and neighborhoods) are discursively normalized and thus depoliticized, other markers of social difference may come to bear an inordinate weight. Absent an articulation of capitalism in the political discourse of identity, the marked identity bears all the weight of the sufferings produced by capitalism in addition to that bound to the explicitly politicized marking.<br />

<strong>Without Attention this Unchecked Capital Will Not Only Cause All Your Impacts, But Eventually the Extinction of All Life on the Planet Through Constant Disaster and Destruction</strong><br />
DYER-WITHERFORD (professor of Library and Info. Sciences at the U of Western Ontario) 1999 [Nick. Cyber Marx: Cycles and Circuits of Struggle in High Technology Capitalism.]<br />
<br />
For capitalism, the use of machines as organs of “will over nature” is an imperative. The great insight of the Frankfurt School—an insight subsequently improved and amplified by feminists and ecologists—was that capital’s dual project of dominating both humanity and nature was intimately tied to the cultivation of “instrumental reason” that systematically objectifies, reduces, quantifies and fragments the world for the purposes of technological control. Business’s systemic need to cheapen labor, cut the costs of raw materials, and expand consumer markets gives it an inherent bias toward the piling-up of technological power. This priority—enshrined in phrases such as “progress,” “efficiency,” “productivity,” “modernization,” and “growth”—assumes an automatism that is used to override any objection or alternative, regardless of the environmental and social consequences. Today, we witness global vistas of toxification, deforestation, desertification, dying oceans, disappearing ozone layers, and disintegrating immune systems, all interacting in ways that perhaps threaten the very existence of humanity and are undeniably inflicting social collapse, disease, and immiseration across the planet. The degree to which this project of mastery has backfired is all too obvious.<br />

<strong>Politics and Morality are Inseperable—the Attempt to Foreground an Ethical or Moral Reason to Take Action Within the Domain of Capitlaism is the Ultimate Violation of Ethics Which Guaruntees The Failure of Radical Politics</strong><br />
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 1995<br />
[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, <em>wyo]</em><br />
<br />
<em>P</em>olitics and morality are so closely intertwined in the real world that it is hardly imaginable to confront and resolve the conflicts of any age without bringing into play the crucial dimensions of both. Thus, whenever it is difficult to face the problems and contradictions of politics in the prevailing social order, theories of morality are also bound to suffer the consequences. Naturally, this relationship tends to prevail also in the positive direction. As the entire history of philosophy testifies, the authors of all major ethical works are also the originators of the seminal theoretical works on politics; and vice versa, all serious conceptualizations of politics have their necessary corollaries on the plane of moral discourse. This goes for Aristotle as much as for Hobbes and Spinoza, and for Rousseau and Kant as much as for Hegel. Indeed, in the case of Hegel we find his ethics fully integrated into his Philosophy of Right, i.e. his theory of the state. This is why it is so astonishing to read in Lukácss ‘Tactics and Ethics’ that ‘Hegel’s system is devoid of ethics’: a view which he later mellows to saying that the Hegelian treatment of ethics suffers the consequences of his system and the conservative bias of his theory of the state. It would be much more correct to say that — despite the conservative bias of his political conception — Hegel is the author of the last great systematic treatment of ethics. Compared to that, the twentieth century in the field of ethics (as well as in that of political philosophy) is very problematical.<br />
No doubt this has a great deal to do ‘eith the ever narrowing margin of alternatives allowed by the necessary mode of functioning of the global capital system which produces the wisdom of ‘there is no alternative’. For, evidently, there can be no meaningful moral discourse on the premiss that ‘there is no alternative’. Ethics is concerned with the evaluation and implementation of alternative goals which individuals and social groups can actually set themselves in their confrontations with the problems of their age. And this is where the inescapability of politics makes its impact. For even the most intensely committed investigation of ethics cannot be a substitute for a radical critique of politics in its frustrating and alienating contemporary reality. The slogan of ‘there is no alternative did not originate in ethics; nor is it enough to reassert in ethical/ontolog!cal terms the need for alternatives, no matter how passionately this is felt and predicated. The pursuit of viable alternatives to the destructive reality of capital’s social order in all its forms without which the socialist project is utterly pointless —is a practical matter. The role of morality and ethics is crucial to the success of this enterprise. But there can be no hope of success without the joint re-articulation of socialist moral discourse and political strategy, taking fully on board the painful lessons of the recent past.<br />

<strong>Focusing on Method as the Basis for Criticism is the Only Way to Formulate Politics—Social Theory, Piecemeal Reform and Identity are Helpless in the Face of Capital</strong><br />
<em>TUMINO (Prof. English @ Pitt) 2001</em><br />
<em>[Stephen, “What is Orthodox Marxism and Why it Matters Now More than Ever”, Red Critique, p. online</em> wyo-tjc]<br />
<br />
Any effective political theory will have to do at least two things: it will have to offer an integrated understanding of social practices and, based on such an interrelated knowledge, offer a guideline for praxis. My main argument here is that among all contesting social theories now, only Orthodox Marxism has been able to produce an integrated knowledge of the existing social totality and provide lines of praxis that will lead to building a society free from necessity.<br />
But first I must clarify what I mean by Orthodox Marxism. Like all other modes and forms of political theory, the very theoretical identity of Orthodox Marxism is itself contested—not just from non-and anti-Marxists who question the very &quot;real&quot; (by which they mean the &quot;practical&quot; as under free-market criteria) existence of any kind of Marxism now but, perhaps more tellingly, from within the Marxist tradition itself. I will, therefore, first say what I regard to be the distinguishing marks of Orthodox Marxism and then outline a short polemical map of contestation over Orthodox Marxism within the Marxist theories now. I will end by arguing for its effectivity in bringing about a new society based not on human rights but on freedom from necessity.<br />
I will argue that to know contemporary society—and to be able to act on such knowledge—one has to first of all know what makes the existing social totality. I will argue that the dominant social totality is based on inequality—not just inequality of power but inequality of economic access (which then determines access to health care, education, housing, diet, transportation, . . . ). This systematic inequality cannot be explained by gender, race, sexuality, disability, ethnicity, or nationality. These are all secondary contradictions and are all determined by the fundamental contradiction of capitalism which is inscribed in the relation of capital and labor. All modes of Marxism now explain social inequalities primarily on the basis of these secondary contradictions and in doing so—and this is my main argument—legitimate capitalism. Why? Because such arguments authorize capitalism without gender, race, discrimination and thus accept economic inequality as an integral part of human societies. They accept a sunny capitalism—a capitalism beyond capitalism. Such a society, based on cultural equality but economic inequality, has always been the not-so-hidden agenda of the bourgeois left—whether it has been called &quot;new left,&quot; &quot;postmarxism,&quot; or &quot;radical democracy.&quot; This is, by the way, the main reason for its popularity in the culture industry—from the academy (Jameson, Harvey, Haraway, Butler,. . . ) to daily politics (Michael Harrington, Ralph Nader, Jesse Jackson,. . . ) to. . . . For all, capitalism is here to stay and the best that can be done is to make its cruelties more tolerable, more humane. This humanization (not eradication) of capitalism is the sole goal of ALL contemporary lefts (marxism, feminism, anti-racism, queeries, . . . ).<br />
Such an understanding of social inequality is based on the fundamental understanding that the source of wealth is human knowledge and not human labor. That is, wealth is produced by the human mind and is thus free from the actual objective conditions that shape the historical relations of labor and capital. Only Orthodox Marxism recognizes the historicity of labor and its primacy as the source of all human wealth. In this paper I argue that any emancipatory theory has to be founded on recognition of the priority of Marx's labor theory of value and not repeat the technological determinism of corporate theory (&quot;knowledge work&quot;) that masquerades as social theory.<br />

<strong>The Inertial Organization of Capital Means that the Permutation is Doomed—Any Residual Capitalist Organization Will Regenerate Itself Like the Hydra</strong><br />
KOVEL (Alger Hiss Prof. At Bard) 2002<br />
[Joel, The Enemy of Nature, Zed Books, p. 142-3<em>wyo-tjc]</em><br />
<br />
The value-term that subsumes everything into the spell of capital sets going a kind of wheel of accumulation, from production to consumption and back, spinning ever more rapidly as the inertial mass of capital grows, and generating its force field as a spinning magnet generates an electrical field. This phenomenon has important implications for the reformability of the system. Because capital is so spectral, and succeeds so well in ideologically mystifying its real nature, attention is constantly deflected from the actual source of eco-destabilization to the instruments by which that source acts. The real problem, however, is the whole mass of globally accumulated capital, along with the speed of its circulation and the class structures sustaining this. That is what generates the force field, in proportion to its own scale; and it is this force field, acting across the numberless points of insertion that constitute the ecosphere, that creates ever larger agglomerations of capital, sets the ecological crisis going, and keeps it from being resolved. For one fact may be taken as certain — that to resolve the ecological crisis as a whole, as against tidying up one corner or another, is radically incompatible with the existence of gigantic pools of capital, the force field these induce, the criminal underworld with which they connect, and, by extension, the elites who comprise the transnational bourgeoisie. And by not resolving the crisis as a whole, we open ourselves to the spectre of another mythical creature, the many-headed hydra, that regenerated itself the more its individual tentacles were chopped away.<br />
To realize this is to recognize that there is no compromising with capital, no schema of reformism that will clean up its act by making it act more greenly or efficiently We shall explore the practical implications of this thesis in Part III, and here need simply to restate the conclusion in blunt terms: green capital, or non-polluting capital, is preferable to the immediately ecodestructive breed on its immediate terms. But this is the lesser point, and diminishes with its very success. For green capital (or ‘socially/ecologically responsible investing’) exists, by its very capital-nature, essentially to create more value, and this leaches away from the concretely green location to join the great pool, and follows its force field into zones of greater concentration, expanded profitability — and greater ecodestruction.<br />

<strong>Finally—Evaluate Epistemology and Method Before You Move to Any Other Consideration—The Way We Know Shapes the Way We Act and Has Consequences Far More Profound Than the Plan</strong><br />
Smith ‘96 [Steve, Professor of International Politics at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, “Positivism and Beyond,” International theory: Positivism and beyond, New York: Cambridge University Press, 12-1 3uwyo-ajl]<br />
<br />
But the stakes are also high because of the links between theory and practice. International theory underpins and informs international practice, even if there is a lengthy lag between the high- point of theories and their gradual absorption into political debate. Once established as common sense, theories become incredibly powerful since they delineate not simply what can be known but also what it is sensible to talk about or suggest. Those who swim outside these safe waters risk more than simply the judgement that their theories are wrong; their entire ethical or moral stance may be ridiculed or seen as dangerous iust because their theoretical assumptions are deemed as unrealistic. Defining common sense is therefore the ultimate act of political power. In this sense what is at stake in debates about epistemology is very significant for political practice. Theories do not simply explain or predict, they tell us what possibilities exist for human action and intervention they define not merely our explanatory possibilities but also our ethical and practical horizons. In this Kantian light epistemology matters, and the stakes are far more considerable than at first sight seem to be the case.<br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Affirmative’s Discussion of International Relations, War and Violence is Imbued With the Metaphysical Concept of Security—Speaking this Discourse Brings With it the Assumptions of Violence Inherent in Contemporary Politics</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Dillon 96 (michael, senior lecturer in politics and international relations at the university of lancaster, the politics of security, p.13-4)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There is a preoccupation, which links both the beginning and the end of metaphysics, and so also the beginning and the end of metaphysical politics. It is something, which, because it furnishes the fundamental link between politics and metaphysics, affords me my entry into the relationship, which obtains between them. That something is security. If the question of the political is to be recovered from metaphysical thinking, therefore, then security has to be brought into question first.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Security, of course, saturates the language of modern politics. Our political vocabularies reek of it and our political imagination is confined by it. The hypocrisy of our rulers (whosoever 'we' are) consistently hides behind it. It would, therefore, be an easy task to establish that security is the first and foundational requirement of the State, of modern understandings of politics, and of International Relations, not only by reference to specific political theorists but also by reference to the discourses of States. But I want to explore the thought that modern politics is a security project for reasons which are antecedent to, and account for, the axioms and propositions of (inter)national political theorists, the platitudes of political discourse, and the practices of States, their political classes and leaders. Consequently, to conceive of our politics, as a politics of security is not to advance a view held by particular thinkers or even by particular disciplines. It is to draw attention to a necessity (which Heidegger's history of metaphysics will later allow us to note and explore) to which all thinkers of politics in the metaphysical tradition are subject. In pursuing this thought it follows that security turns-out to have a much wider register - has always and necessarily had a much wider register, something which modern international security studies have begun to register - than that merely of preserving our so-called basic values, or even our mortal bodies. That it has, in fact, always been concerned with securing the very grounds of what the political itself is; specifying what the essence of politics is thought to be. The reason is that the thought within which political thought occurs - metaphysics-and specifically its conception of truth, is itself a security project, For metaphysics is a tradition of thought defined in terms of the pursuit of security: with the securing, in fact of a secure arche, determining principle, beginning or ground, for which its under-standing of truth and its quest for certainty calls. Security, then, finds its expression as the principle, ground or arche - for which metaphysical thought is a search - upon which something stands, pervading and guiding it in its whole structure and essence. Hence, as Leibniz wrote: If one builds a house in a sandy place, one must continue digging until one meets solid rock or firm foundations; if one wants to unravel a tangled thread one must look for the beginning of the thread; if the greatest weights are to be moved, Archimedes demanded only a stable place. In the same way, if one is to establish the elements of human knowledge some fixed point is required, on which we can safely rest and from which we can set out without fear. (emphasis added) It is for this reason, therefore, that metaphysics first allows security to impress itself upon political thought as a self-evident condition for the very existence of life - both individual and social. One of those impulses which it is said appears like an inner command to be instinctive (in the form, for, of the instinct for survival), or axiomatic (in the form of the principle of self-preservation, the right to life, or the right to self defense), security thereby became the value which modern understandings of the political and modern practices of politics have come to put beyond question, precisely because they derived its very requirement from the requirements of metaphysical truth itself. In consequence, security became the predicate upon which the architectonic political discourses of modernity were constructed; upon which the vernacular architecture of modern political power, exemplified in the State, was based; and from which the institutions and practices of modern (inter)national politics, including modern democratic politics, ultimately seek to derive their grounding and foundational legitimacy. Thus, for example, and in a time other than our own, the security of an ecumene of belief in the ground of a divinely ordained universe promising salvation for human beings - something that, constituting the Christian Church, provided an ideal of community which continues to pervade the Western tradition -¬insisted: extra ecclesjam nulla salus' (no salvation outside the Church). Salvation was the ultimate form of spiritual security. And that security was to be acquired through being gathered back into where we belong; a belonging, in other words, to God. What is crucial here is not what happens to us after death, but salvation as the expression of the longing for the return to a pure and unadulterated form of belonging; a final closing-up of the wound of existence by returning to a lost oneness that never was. The reverse of Cyprian's dictum was, of course, equally true. No Church without salvation. The outcome of this project was a rejection of the world through the constitution of an ideal world which - not least because of the model it offered, the resentment which it fostered and the economy of salvation and cruelty which it instantiated - acted in the world to constitute a form of redeeming politics. In a way that indicates the continuity of the metaphysical tradition, however, this slogan can be, and was, easily adjusted to furnish the defining maxim of modern politics: no security outside the State; no State without security. And this, in its turn, has given rise to powerful forms of what I would call the disciplinary politics of Hobbesian thought and the actuarial politics of technologies thought. Each of these is also concerned to specify the principle, ground or rule that would satisfy the metaphysically sequestered compulsion for security: thus relieving human beings of the dilemmas and challenges it faces to discover, in its changing circumstances, what it is to be - to act and live - as humans. The basic thought to be pursued is one which, in simultaneously drawing both our current politics and our tradition of political thought into question by challenging their mutual foundation in security, serves, in addition, to illustrate and explore some important aspects of the political implications of Heidegger's thought. My thought, then, is that modern politics is a security project in the widest possible - ontological - sense of the term because it was destined to become so by virtue of the very character or nature of the thinking of truth within which, through which, and by continuous and intimate reference to which, politics itself has always been thought. What is at issue first of all, for me, therefore, is not whether one says yes or no to our modern (inter)national regimes of security, but what Foucault would have called the overall discursive fact that security is spoken about at all, the way in which it is put into political discourse and how it circulates throughout politics and other discourses. I think Heidegger's account of meta physics provides a means of addressing that fundamental question. &lt;P 13-14&gt;</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Security discourses create a will to power and a desire for protection from unknown threats. This need for certainty makes preventing violence impossible. There will always be external threats to world order.</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Der Derian 95 (James, Professor of Political Science at Brown University, “The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard,” Chapter Two in On Security by Ronnie D. Lipschutz)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The will to power, then, should not be confused with a Hobbesian perpetual desire for power. It can, in its negative form, produce a reactive and resentful longing for only power, leading, in Nietzsche's view, to a triumph of nihilism. But Nietzsche refers to a positive will to power, an active and affective force of becoming, from which values and meanings--including self-preservation--are produced which affirm life. Conventions of security act to suppress rather than confront the fears endemic to life, for &quot;. . . life itself is essentially appropriation, injury, overpowering of what is alien and weaker; suppression, hardness, imposition of one's own forms, incorporation and at least, at its mildest, exploitation--but why should one always use those words in which slanderous intent has been imprinted for ages.&quot; 35 Elsewhere Nietzsche establishes the pervasiveness of agonism in life: &quot;life is a consequence of war, society itself a means to war.&quot; 36 But the denial of this permanent condition, the effort to disguise it with a consensual rationality or to hide from it with a fictional sovereignty, are all effects of this suppression of fear. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The desire for security is manifested as a collective resentment of difference--that which is not us, not certain, not predictable. Complicit with a negative will to power is the fear-driven desire for protection from the unknown. Unlike the positive will to power, which produces an aesthetic affirmation of difference, the search for truth produces a truncated life which conforms to the rationally knowable, to the causally sustainable. In The Gay Science , Nietzsche asks of the reader: &quot;Look, isn't our need for knowledge precisely this need for the familiar, the will to uncover everything strange, unusual, and questionable, something that no longer disturbs us? Is it not the instinct of fear that bids us to know? And is the jubilation of those who obtain knowledge not the jubilation over the restoration of a sense of security?&quot; 37 </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The fear of the unknown and the desire for certainty combine to produce a domesticated life, in which causality and rationality become the highest sign of a sovereign self, the surest protection against contingent forces. The fear of fate assures a belief that everything reasonable is true, and everything true, reasonable. In short, the security imperative produces, and is sustained by, the strategies of knowledge which seek to explain it. Nietzsche elucidates the nature of this generative relationship in The Twilight of the Idols : </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The causal instinct is thus conditional upon, and excited by, the feeling of fear. The &quot;why?&quot; shall, if at all possible, not give the cause for its own sake so much as for a particular kind of cause --a cause that is comforting, liberating and relieving. . . . That which is new and strange and has not been experienced before, is excluded as a cause. Thus one not only searches for some kind of explanation, to serve as a cause, but for a particularly selected and preferred kind of explanation--that which most quickly and frequently abolished the feeling of the strange, new and hitherto unexperienced: the most habitual explanations. 38 </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A safe life requires safe truths. The strange and the alien remain unexamined, the unknown becomes identified as evil, and evil provokes hostility--recycling the desire for security. The &quot;influence of timidity,&quot; as Nietzsche puts it, creates a people who are willing to subordinate affirmative values to the &quot;necessities&quot; of security: &quot;they fear change, transitoriness: this expresses a straitened soul, full of mistrust and evil experiences.&quot; 39</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We Must Not Ignore These Questions About Security—Continuation of the Status Quo Politics Risks the Totality of Violence and Human Extinction</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Dillon 96 (MICHAEL, SENIOR LECTURER IN POLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LANCASTER, THE POLITICS OF SECURITY) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">To put it crudely, and ignoring for the moment Heidegger's so-called `anti humanist' (he thought 'humanism' was not uncannily human enough) hostility to the anthropocentrism of Western thought. As the real prospect of human species extinction is a function of how human beinq has come to dwell in the world, then human beinq has a pressinq reason to reconsider, in the most originary way possible, notwithstanding other arguments that may be advanced for doing so, the derivation of its understandinq of what it is to dwell in the world, and how it should comport itself if it is to continue to do so. Such a predicament ineluctably poses two fundamental and inescapable questions about both Philosophy and politics back to philosophy and politics and of the relation between them: first, if such is their end, what must their oriqins have been? Second, in the midst of all that is, in Precisely what does the creativity of new beqinninqs inhere and how can it be preserved, celebrated and extended? No matter how much we may want to elide these questions, or, alternatively, provide a whole series of edifying answers to them, human beinqs cannot iqnore them, ironically, even if they remain anthropocentric in their concerns, if they wish to survive. Our present does not allow it. This ioint reqress of the philosophical and the political to the very limits of their thinking and of their possibility therefore brinqs the question of Beinq (which has been the question of philosophy, even though it has always been directed towards beings in the answers it has offered) into explicit coniunction with the question of the political once more throuqh the attention it draws to the ontoloqical difference between Beinq and beinqs, and emphasises the abidinq reciprocity that exists between them.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We now know that neither metaphysics nor our politics of security can secure the security of truth and of life which was their reciprocatinq raison d'66tre (and, raison d'etat). More importantly, we now know that the very will to security - the will to power of sovereiqn presence in both metaphysics and modern politics - is not only a prime incitement to violence in the Western tradition of thouqht, and to the qlobalisation of its (inter)national palitics, but also self-defeatinq; in that it does not in its turn merely endanqer, but actually enqenders danqer in response to its own discursive dynamic. One does not have to be persuaded of the destinal sendinq of Beinq, therefore, to be persuaded of the profundity - and of the profound danqer- of this the modern human condition.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Only By Reimagining Politics Through the Rejection of Security Discourse Can We Challenge these Problematic Constructions</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Dillon 96 (MICHAEL, SENIOR LECTURER IN POLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LANCASTER, THE POLITICS OF SECURITY)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Reimagining politics is, of course, easier said than done. Resistance to it - especially in International Relations - nonetheless gives us a clue to one of the places where we may begin. For although I think of this project as a kind of political project, resistance to it does not arise from a political conservatism. Modern exponents of political modernity pride themselves on their realistic radicalism. Opposition always arises, instead, from an extraordinarily deep and profound conservatism of thought. Indeed, conservatism of thought in respect of the modern political imagination is required of the modern political subject. Remaining politics therefore means thinking differently. Moreover, the project of that thinking differently leads to thinking 'difference' itself.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Thought is therefore required if politics is to contribute to out-living the modern; specifically, political thought. The challenge to out-live the modern issues from the faltering of modern thought, however, and the suspicion now of its very own project of thought, as much as it does from the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the industrialization and ecological despoliation of the planet, or the genocidal dynamics of new nationalisms. The challenqe to out-live the modern issues, therefore, from the modern condition of both politics and thouqht. This so- called suspicion of thouqht - I would rather call it a transformation of the project of thought which has disclosed the faltering of the modern project of thought - is what has come to distinguish continental thouqht in the last century. I draw on that thouqht in order to think the freedom of human beinq aqainst the defininq political thouqht of modernity: that ontoloqical preoccupation with the subject of security which commits its politics to securinq the subiect. Motivated therefore, by a certain sense of crisis in both philosophy and politics, and by the conviction that there is an intimate relation between the two which is most violently and materially exhibited globally in (inter)national politics, the aim of this book is to make a contribution towards rethinking some of the fundamentals of International Relations through what I would call the political philosophy of contemporary continental thought. Its ultimate intention is, therefore, to make a contribution toward the reconstruction of International Relations as a site of political thouqht, bv departinq from the very commitment to the politics of sublectivity upon which International Relations is premised. This is a tall order, and not least because the political philosophy of continental thought cannot be brought to bear upon International Relations if the political thought of that thought remains largely unthought. &lt;P 2&gt;</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Discourses of security necessarily invoke their opposite—the logic of violence proposes a perpetual counter-violence and insecurity which makes their impacts a self-fulfilling prophecy. </span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Chernus, PROFESSOR OF RELIGIOUS STUDIES UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER, 2K1 Ira, Israel and the United States: Fighting Terror in the National Insecurity State, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1206:http://spot.colorado.edu/~chernus/SinceSeptember11.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://spot.colorado.edu/~chernus/SinceSeptember11.htm" rel="nofollow">http://spot.colorado.edu/~chernus/SinceSeptember11.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1206 --> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In this sense, too, the U.S. is in Israel’s shoes. Both are entrenched in the logic of the insecurity state. That logic flows from two fundamental principles: there is a mortal threat to the very existence of our nation, and our own policies play no role in generating the threat. If our nation bears no responsibility, then we are powerless to eradicate the threat. There is no hope for a truly better world, nor for ending the danger by mutual compromise with &quot;the other side.&quot; The threat is effectively eternal. The best to hope for is to hold the threat forever at bay. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Yet the sense of powerlessness is oddly satisfying, because it preserves the conviction of innocence: if our policies are so ineffectual, the troubles of the world can hardly be our fault. And the vision of an endless status quo is equally satisfying, because it promises to prevent historical change. If peril is permanent, the world is an endless reservoir of potential enemies. Any fundamental change in the status quo portends only catastrophe. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The only path to security, it seems, is to prevent change by imposing control over others. When those others fight back, the national insecurity state sees no reason to re-evaluate its policies; that would risk the change it seeks, above all, to avoid. So it can only meet violence with more violence, while protesting its innocence. Of course, the inevitable frustration is blamed on the enemy, reinforcing the sense of peril and the demand for absolute control through violence.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The goal of total control is self-defeating; each step toward security becomes a source of, and is taken as proof of, continuing insecurity. This makes the logic of the insecurity state viciously circular. Why are we always fighting? Because we always have enemies. How do we know we always have enemies? Because we are always fighting. And knowing that we have enemies, how can we afford to stop fighting? In the insecurity state, there is no way to talk about security without voicing fears of insecurity, no way to express optimism without expressing despair. On every front, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy; a self-confirming and self-perpetuating spiral of violence; a trap that seems to offer no way out.</span><br />

<br />
First, as we have seen above, the evil in question here is nothing simply present, but is found on both sides of a line describing withholding. Evil is never itself fully or completely present and made public; rather it is always also withheld. This withholding is why the younger man objects to the original definition of evil. Evil does not let itself be grasped and categorized in complete detail; its withholding prevents all that. The best that can be said for it is that evil is malevolent. There are different sorts of evil and different kinds of evil actions, but to evil as such we can have no access. It is simply not present. Second, the withholding character of evil (malevolence) makes clear that the essence of evil lies in the threat of a wrathful outbreak, not in that outbreak itself. Because the wrath never completely breaks out, there is always the threat of more wrath to come. Evil lies in the fact that there is always more wrath to unleash. Which is to say that evil is not real or effective, in the usual sense of these terms, or rather, that reality itself is not real. Reality is the disguise of evil, and it is this same staging of presence that Heidegger had previously discussed in regards to the beings of machination, which objectively present themselves “as if beyng did not essence” (GA 65: 115/81; tm). It is this very inability to completely unleash itself—for presence to ever be fully present— that frustrates evil and angers it further. Evil wants out, and by being held in, this want of evil is driven forth all the stronger. As we are dealing here with an evil of technology and machination, it is no surprise that the operative logic, as read by Heidegger, is Nietzschean, a logic of power and self-empowerment, i.e., a logic of the will. The limit of the will is set in order that it might be transgressed and that the domain of the will may be expanded in the process. A new boundary is then set, only in order that it too might soon be crossed in this expansionist metaphysics of the will. The older man recognizes this willful component in evil: “If, however, evil rests in malevolence, which is in itself furious [in sich ergrimmt ist] about its own wrath, and therefore increasingly more wrathful, then I would almost say that the malevolent would be something willful [Willensmäßiges]” (GA 77: 208; em).19 This evil, which knows no end and is only enraged by its frustration, infuriated to the point of crossing the bounds of its own fury, this willful evil devastates the world. Devastation (Verwüstung) is the process by which the world becomes a desert (Wüste), a sandy expanse that seemingly extends without end, without landmarks or direction, and is devoid of all life.20 If we follow the dialogue in thinking an ancient Greek notion of “life” as another name for “being,” then the lifeless desert is the being-less desert. The world that becomes a lifeless desert is consequently an unworld from which being has withdrawn. The older prisoner makes this connection explicit, “The being of an age of devastation would then consist in the abandonment of being” (GA 77: 213). As we have seen, this is a process that befalls the world, slowly dissolving it of worldliness and rendering it an “unworld” (cf. GA 7: 88, 92f./EP, 104, 107f., etc.). Yet this unworld is not simply the opposite of world; it remains a world, but a world made desert. The desert is not the complete absence of world. Such an absence would not be reached by devastation (Verwüstung), but rather by annihilation (Vernichtung); and for Heidegger, annihilation is far less of a concern than devastation: “Devastation is more uncanny than mere annihilation [bloße Vernichtung]. Mere annihilation sweeps aside all things including even nothingness, while devastation on the contrary orders [bestellt] and spreads everything that blocks and prevents” (WHD, 11/29–30; tm). Annihilation as a thought of total absence is a thought from metaphysics. It is one with a thinking of pure presence: pure presence, pure absence, and purely no contact between them. During another lecture course on Hölderlin, this time in 1942 on the hymn “The Ister,” Heidegger claims that annihilation is precisely the agenda of America in regards to the “homeland,” which is here equated with Europe: “We know today that the Anglo-Saxon world of Americanism has resolved to annihilate [zu vernichten] Europe, that is, the homeland, and that means: the inception of the Western world. The inceptual is indestructible [unzerstörbar]” (GA 53: 68/54; tm). America is the agent of technological devastation, and it operates under the assumptions of presence and absence that it itself is so expert at dissembling. America resolves to annihilate and condemns itself to failure in so doing, for the origin is “indestructible.” We could take this a step further and claim that only because the origin cannot be annihilated is it possible to destroy it. This possibility of destruction is its indestructible character. It can always be further destroyed, but you will never annihilate it. Americanism names the endeavor or resolution to drive the destruction of the world ever further into the unworld. America is the agent of a malevolent being.<br />

<strong>The question of this debate is one of competing ontologies. The affirmative staked out an ontology of calculative thinking. A competing ontology is meditative thinking. As long we leave calculative thinking unquestioned we are doomed to the ethos of mastery. Meditative thinking offers us a way of nondominating thinking.</strong><br />

<br />
When Heidegger thematizes the Being question in relation to modern subjectivism, he seeks to<br />
effect a shift from representational thinking, which conceives truth and the locus of objectivity exclusively in the human subject, to what he calls a more meditative thinking (besinnlichesDenken). Heidegger's discovery, the &quot;alternative&quot; to instrumental thinking and modern subjectivism, (1) displaces the rootedness in subjective states and (2) reconceives the strict subject/object distinction, and the objectification and domination of the object-domain that results from this. This can also be described as the effort to shift from a transcendentalist focus. This focus views truth in terms of the certainty of representation, rooted in subjectivity and, more generally, conceives the parameters of inquiry - awareness of a world of objects - from within the vantage point of the subject's own human &quot;horizon.&quot; Heidegger seeks to reconceive the traditional conceptions of truth and Being, and shift our focus to an awareness of the ground, or field, of the human horizon.<br />
This antisubjectivist critique, made in the name of a [*865] thematization and recognition of Being as the sustaining ground &quot;in reference to which the diverse meanings of Being arise,&quot; hassignificant critical force. Heidegger's critique here can be placed along with other powerful critiques of modern instrumentalist calculative reason, like the efforts of the early Frankfurt School, Adorno, and Horkheimer n28 and, more recently, Habermas. n29 Heidegger powerfully examines the workings of this objectifying, calculative reason in examining the effects of its domination of things in the world and nature. That is to say, Heidegger's own explicit concern in these writings is with domination, the ethos of mastery, as it is deployed against things and nature. n30 To find an alternative, non-dominating and non-objectifying conception of our relation to the world, he does two things: First, he calls our attention to the way that human being is &quot;in&quot; the world in a more relational, rather than divisive, situation of belonging to the world,rather than standing over and against it, as subject over object, lord or master. Second, he calls for a recognition of Being as the ground of the human, transcendental horizon. This is his antisubjectivist thematization of the ground or field of human awareness. In my view, the antisubjectivist critique at the center of Heidegger's project has a powerful critical force,<br />
especially in analyzing the genesis and effects of environmental degradation. n31<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Policy itself can be analysed conceptually at a number of different levels. In its broadest sense, the term policy can be used to include projects, programmes, strategies, plans and their implementation, in fact every element of public or collective decision-making. Although it is a rather artificial simplification, policy can be divided into content and the process of policy formulation, in other words the way in which that content is arrived at. The way in which policy is implemented can change the effective content of policy, either because policy interactions have not been fully understood, or because the policy is subverted by those responsible for implementing it.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">At the foundation of this approach is power projection. Power projection is a means to influence actors or affect situations or events in America’s national interest. It has two components: warfighting and presence. Warfighting is the direct application of military force to compel an adversary. Presence is the posturing of military capability, including nonbelligerent applications, and/or the leveraging of information to deter or compel an actor or affect a situation. A sound national military strategy depends on coherent warfighting and presence strategies. Changes in the international security environment, advances in technology, and reductions in America’s military force structure require a fresh consideration of America’s presence strategy.</span><br />

From this database, current and historical records may be searched for U.S. exports to Asia Pacific countries with the end use category ‘‘defense.’’ This ensured that dual use products were excluded from the search. Seven sectors may be identified for defense trade including military aircrafts, aircraft launching gear/parachutes, etc., engines/turbines for military aircraft, military trucks/armored vehicles, etc., military ships/boats, tanks/artillery/ missiles/rockets/guns/ammunition, and parts/special goods, etc. Not all of the sectors will be analyzed because many countries contain only very sparse data. Approximately thirty Asia Pacific countries are identified to be engaged in defense trade with the US although this number varies from sector to sector. The countries include all members of APEC and the ARF but also extend to other countries that have been excluded from these arrangements such as Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Oceania. Defense exports are supplemented by two other sources of data, that is, US military presence and countries’ military expenditure. US military presence is measured by the number and shares of active military personnel in the region. This information is compiled by the US Department of Defense (<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1214:http://www.dior.whs.mil/mmid/military/miltop.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dior.whs.mil/mmid/military/miltop.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dior.whs.mil/mmid/military/miltop.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1214 -->). Statistics on military expenditures may be obtained from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (www.sipri. org). In addition, contextual information is also collected from research monographs on US military strategies. These reports are compiled by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) in Washington, D.C., and CRS constitutes the public policy research arm of the US Congress. Many of these reports include testimonials to the Congress regarding defense and strategic events in the Asia Pacific, and provide important documentation as well as evidence of US geopolitical interests, policies and developments in the region.</span><br />
