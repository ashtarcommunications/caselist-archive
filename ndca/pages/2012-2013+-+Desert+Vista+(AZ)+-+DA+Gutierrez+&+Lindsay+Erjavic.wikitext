==Inherency: The Annemone== 

====Lack of charging outlets is the major barrier for EV market penetration - only 3,300 exist and they are unevenly distributed==== 
**Kemp, 5/25/12**<span style="font-size: 16px;"> – Senior Market Analyst and writer for Reuters specializing in commodities and energy (John, "Column- Will US Federal Fleet Help Alternative Fuel Switch?," Reuters, http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/25/column-kemp-cars-idUSL5E8GP8YG20120525) // AMG</span>
Federal law defines alternative fuel vehicles broadly to include both those running on alternative fuels
AND
Indiana and Minnesota, but not many in the rest of the country.

==Advantage 1: Finding Nemo==

**Hall 2012** (Carin Hall, July 9, 2012, "Ocean Acidification: Climate Change~’s ~’Evil Twin~’," Energy Digital, http://www.energydigital.com/green_technology/ocean-acidification-climate-changes-evil-twin)
The alarmingly high acid levels in the ocean, threatening the world~’s coral reefs,

of change simply because it~’s a big atmosphere and it~’s a big ocean."

====Warming is real and anthropogenic - overwhelming consensus concludes aff and all alt causes are insignificant.==== 
**Rahmstorf 2008** (Richard Rahmstorf, physics professor at Potsdam University, "Anthropogenic Climate Change?" Page 42-49)
It is time to turn to statement B: human activities are altering the climate
AND
that anthropogenic global warming is a reality with which we need to deal.


====Destroying Coral Reefs leads to Extinction==== 
**US Department of State 2000** ( "Coral Reefs: Fertile Gardens of the Sea," online)
According to the Worldwatch Institute publication, "State of the World 2000," reefs

survival and will continue to be an urgent issue in the 21st century.

====EV~’s substantially curb CO2 emissions.==== 
**Sierra Club 11** (Electric Vehicles: Myths vs. Reality

According to a range of studies, an electric car leads to 35 to 60

opportunity to take advantage of wind power — another way to reduce emissions.

==Advantage 2: Just Keep Swimming past Nuclear War== 


War won~’t happen- history proves

If you want to understand the intensifying showdown between the United States and Iran,
AND
just over the horizon, and that~’s where it is likely to stay.


Great power war is obsolete and small conflicts will not escalate—many reasons

MANDELBAUM **1999 (Michael, Professor of American Foreign Policy, Johns Hopkins University; Director, Project on East-West Relations, Council on Foreign Relations, "Transcript: is Major War Obsolete?" Transcript of debate with John Mearsheimer, CFR, Feb 25, http://www.ciaonet.org/conf/cfr10/)====**

<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">My argument says, tacitly, </span>

pawn, not a sentry standing guard against an attack on a king."

====Nuclear wars would be limited and is checked by rationale behavior – climate change outweighs.==== 
**New York End Times, 2006**(Non-Partisan News Filter Monitoring World Pertaining to Extinction, "The Extinction Scale," October 16, [[http://newyorkendtimes.com/extinctionscale.asp-http://newyorkendtimes.com/extinctionscale.asp]])

We rate Global Climate Change as a greater threat for human extinction in this
AND
monitor war separately. However we also need to incorporate the dangers here.

Nuclear war will not happen.
**Tepperman, 2009**(Jonathan, Deputy Editor of Newsweek International, "Why Obama Should Learn to Love the Bomb," http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/08/28/why-obama-should-learn-to-love-the-bomb.html)

The argument that nuclear weapons can be agents of peace as well as destruction
AND
leaders in each country did what they had to do to avoid it.

====China war will not occur.==== 
**Qingguo and Rosecrance, 2010**(Jia, Associate Dean of the School of International Studies at Peking Unviesrity, and Richard, Adjunct Professor in Public Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, "Delicately Poised: Are China and the US Heading for Conflict?", January 2010, http://www.globalasia.org/V4N4_Winter_2010/Jia_Qingguo_Richard_Rosecrance.html? PHPSESSID=b3942709bc456ae3c2789a06c6f75ca9)

Will China and the US Go to War? If one accepts the previous
AND
to territorial expansion and war with the US? The answer is no.

No extinction—fallout, ozone, fires, and nuclear winter are all wrong

Even the worst possible nuclear war would leave 90% of the world~’s population unhurt—huge areas would not be effected

To summarise the above points, a major global nuclear war in which population centres

the capacity to kill everyone on earth, is highly misleading.~~[14~~]

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Brian Levin with ChargePoint added, "as a provider of charging systems, I see the EV market from a unique perspective so let me say this: </span>electric vehicles are not only here to stay, but businesses, building owners, and corporations are beginning to see the economic potential of installing charging stations and responding positively."

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Overall, this is a good thing. </span>With a combo socket standardized on U.S.-spec electric cars going forward, there~’s an incentive to make fast charging more widely available. There~’s always been a business case to make for restaurants, movie theaters, supermarkets (Whole Foods has already taken the plunge) and other go-to destinations to provide EV charging<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. With 480 volts, a near-dead car can be recharged in the time it takes to shop for organic peanut butter.</span>
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Here~’s one way of looking at it:</span>
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">AND</span>
major boost to the green image, too.

Federal investment in EV chargers increases commercial feasibility and decreases consumer cost
