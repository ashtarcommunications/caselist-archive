**The central goal of U.S. foreign and defense policy is to ensure the safety and prosperity of the American people… The United States must therefore avoid an open-ended commitment in Afghanistan, especially when the costs of military engagement exceed the likely benefits.**

**Okay, it hasn’t happened yet -- and the odds are it never will… With everything else Americans have to deal with, who needs a future Petraeus Syndrome?**

===1AC - Plan=== 

**Thus the plan:**
The United States federal government should substantially draw down its military presence in Afghanistan by shifting from a counter-insurgency strategy to a counter-terrorism strategy that reduces its military footprint to the minimum level needed to help train Afghan security forces, prevent massive human rights atrocities, resist an expansion of Taliban control beyond the Pashtun south, and engage in robust counter-terrorism operations as needed including a decrease to 68,000 troops or less by October 2011 and 30,000 or less by July 2012.
We’ll clarify.


===1AC - Solvency=== 

==Barkley Forum 1AC== 
Plan: The United States federal government should draw down the population-centric counterinsurgency presence of its military in Afghanistan to 68,000 or less troops conducting counterterrorism operations by October 2011 and 30,000 or less troops conducting counterterrorism operations by July 2012.

Contention 1: Military Power

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">First, dogmatic commitment to COIN creates an expectations gap and ensures serial policy failure. </span>**
**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Gentile, 10</span>** [Gian P.

Carl von Clausewitz said that… find the time to do it now.  

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Second, COIN operations in Afghanistan have crippled overall readiness by eliminating training exercises, crowding out preparation for major conflicts, impoverishing equipment inventories, and depleting U.S. strategic reserves. </span>**
David **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Wood</span>**, Chief Military Correspondent for Politics Daily, has worked as a war reporter for 30 years, was named a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his reporting on conflict, national security, and foreign affairs, has won the Gerald Ford Prize for Distinguished Reporting on National Defense and the Headliners Club award for his reporting on Iraq, has lectured at the Marine Staff College, the Joint Forces Staff College, and the Army's Eisenhower Fellows conference, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">12-27</span>**-2010 (“Busy With Afghanistan, the U.S. Military Has No Time to Train for Big Wars,” Politics Daily, December 27th, Available Online at http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/12/27/busy-with-afghanistan-the-u-s-military-has-no-time-to-train-fo/print/, Accessed 01-03-2011) 
The painful story of Task Force Smith... have the stuff to do it with. 


**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Third, COIN narrows the gap between the U.S. and its peer competitors—this negates the benefits of strong military power. </span>**
Bernard I. **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Finel</span>**, Professor of Military Strategy and Operations at the U.S. National War College, former Executive Director of the Security Studies Program and the Center for Peace and Security Studies at Georgetown University, 20**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">10</span>** (“An alternative to COIN,” //<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Armed Forces Journal</span>//, February, Available Online at http://www.afji.com/2010/02/4387134, Accessed 10-12-2010) 
The U.S. military is a dominant fighting force...where American forces excel. 

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Fourth, the status quo is the worst of all possible worlds: attempting to maintain a full-spectrum military while simultaneously engaging in COIN will decimate U.S. military power and provoke the rise of hostile global rivals. </span>**

We've heard much about terrorism...conflicts between nuclear parties.  

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">A strong military is crucial to spur the international cooperation needed to address emerging threats—failure to do so makes global conflict inevitable. </span>**

These five trends frame a range...higher than anyone would like. 

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The plan is the best way to maintain American hegemony—it maximizes deterrence while abandoning foolish and ineffective adventurism. </span>**
Christopher **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Layne</span>**, Associate Professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University and Research Fellow with the Center on Peace and Liberty at The Independent Institute, **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">2006</span>** (“America cannot rely on power alone,” //<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Financial Times</span>//, August 24th, Available Online at http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f7bb5fb2-330c-11db-87ac-0000779e2340.html, Accessed 04-12-2007) 
Hegemony, however, is not omnipotence...struggle between good and evil. 

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">First, ending COIN in Afghanistan prevents the US from continuing COIN or engaging in quagmires anywhere else. </span>**
**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The Afghanistan Study Group 1-13</span>**-2011 (“The Military-Industrial Complex and the Future of COIN”, January 13th, [[http://progressiverealist.org/blogpost/military-industrial-complex-and-future-coin]]) 
January 17th marks the fiftieth anniversary...Let’s hope Professor Adams is right. 

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Second, The decisions we make on Afghanistan will determine how we conduct foreign policy for the next generation </span>**
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Lorelei</span> **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Kelly</span>**, <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">national security expert and Director of the New Strategic Security Initiative and the Afghanistan Congressional Communications Hub, former Senior Associate at the Henry L.

I think the greatest question...for the next generation. 

Contention 2: Solvency

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">First, we’re not buying what the Obama Administration is selling: the war in Afghanistan is a colossal failure and evidence to the contrary is military fiction. </span>**

====**Politics DA**==== 

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Peace process now– Political and security pressure inside Israel and Palestine have forged a unique opportunity for a deal to be made – Obama investments of political capital have brought the parties back to the table </span>**

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Why has the presence of U.S. ground...their headquarters in the United States.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">There are other complications...even more sensitive and provocative</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">The conclusions from these...biological or chemical terrorism.</span>

====**Six Party Talks Frontline**==== 

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">1. The talks will go on—war games don’t affect prospects for six party talks because the North wants peace more than war</span>**

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Another difference between presence...considered part of presence.</span>
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">B. The Aff withdraws TNW’s not troops</span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">C. Vote neg</span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">1. Limits – allowing TNWs allows affs to withdraw any form of weaponry – that explodes limits – they open up a separate lit base</span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">2. Ground – presence is forward deployed troops – including weapons avoids core Neg generics</span>**
