===Observation 1NC=== 
**The plan establishes a regime of biopolitical control- The military and surveillance applications rooted in the affirmative turn the population in to passive conformists**
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Dickens and Omrod ’07</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> (Peter Dickens, Fellow of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, University of Cambridge, UK and Visiting Professor of Sociology, University of Essex, UK, and James S. Omrod, Teaching Fellow in the Department of Sociology, University of Essex, UK, 8/2007, Sage Journals Online, [[http://soc.sagepub.com/content/41/4/609]])</span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">There are two mechanisms through which the majority ....explosion, play on this kind of sentiment.</span>

**This extension of state control over individual life legitimizes racism and the annihilation of entire populations with mass genocides and nuclear weapons**
Mitchell <span style="font-size: 16px;">Dean</span>, 200<span style="font-size: 16px;">1</span> (Professor of Sociology at Macquarie University, “Demonic Societies: Liberalism, Biopolitics, and Sovereignty”, Ethnographic Explorations of the Postcolonial State, p. 55-58)
Consider again the contrastive terms in which it <span class="UnderlineChar">....the functioning of the modern state</span> (232).

**Our alternative is to assume the role of specific intellectuals within the round by rejecting the notion of disciplinary power. Only by constant problematization of the way the affirmative harnesses governmentality can we open up a new space of contestation.**
David <span style="font-size: 16px;">Owen</span>, 19<span style="font-size: 16px;">94</span> (Professor of Social and Political Philosophy at University of Southampton, Morality and Modernity, p. 208-210)
The ‘universal’ intellectual, on Foucault’s account....the contestation of determinations of who we are.

**<span style="color: #000000;">Not engaging the underlying problematizations behind their assumptions makes serial policy failure inevitable</span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Michael </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Dillon</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, Professor of Political Science at Lancaster and internationally renowed author </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">and</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> Julian </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Reid</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, lecturer on international relations and progessor of political Science at King’s College in Longon, </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">2k</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> (Alternatives, Volume 25, Issue 1: Global Governance, Liberal Peace, and Complex Emergency) </span>
<span style="font-size: 16px;">As a precursor to global governance, governmentality</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">....then serially reproblematizes in terms of policy failure**.**</span>

===Weaponization 1NC=== 
**First, the plan establishes a regime of biopolitical control – the entire population of earth becomes subject to absolute levels of disciplinary regulation.**

In light of Foucault's incisive analysis, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">focusing....comply with the will of the imperial center</span>.

==Capitalism K== 
===Generic 1NC=== 
**The exploration and development of space is the newest manifestation of the ‘outside’; a short-term solution to economic and societal crisis on Earth. Resources may expand- but war is inevitable in order to maintain and secure new found markets.**
Peter Dickens, teaches at the Universities of Brighton and Cambridge, UK, in ’<span style="font-size: 12pt;">10</span> [“The Humanization of the Cosmos—To What End?”, Monthly Review, Vol. 62 No. 6, http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end]
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Instead of indulging in over-optimistic and fantastic visions...... </span>and companies attempting to make their own cosmic “fixes.”

**Our alternative is fidelity to the communist hypothesis as a necessary response to the affirmative’s naturalization of the ideology of capital.**
**This ethico-political challenge to capitalism opens true revolutionary potential. The only other option to revolution is a life not worth lived- the exclusionary practices of capitalism make ecological catastrophe and extinction inevitable**
Slavoj Zizek, crack addict, 2009 [First as Tragedy, Then as Farce page 87-94
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">In Kierkegaardian terms, a revolutionary process involves not a gradual progress....</span>the world that has been sustaining us.5



===Marxism 1NC=== 
**Transition is inevitable- focus on _ legitimizes capitalism by humanizing it.**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tumino</span>, Professor of English at the University of Pittsburgh, 200<span style="font-size: 12pt;">5</span> (Stephen, “What is Orthodox Marxism and Why it Matters Now More than Ever,” February 14, http://www.redcritique.org/spring2001/whatisorthodoxmarxism.htm)
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Any effective political theory</span> will have to do....<span style="font-size: 12pt;">needs"</span> (Marx) is the rule.

**The primary ethical directive of politics is to fight against global capitalism. The large scale social exclusion and exploitation of entire groups of people is rendered incalculable and hidden within the framework of capital.**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zizek and Daly 04</span> (Slavoj, professor of philosophy at the Institute for Sociology, Ljubljana, and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek, pg 14-16) JXu
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">For Zizek it is imperative that we</span> cut....of a 'glitch' in an otherwise sound matrix.

**Our alternative is to reject both reform and postmodern intellectualism and instead demand a radical destruction of the capitalist system.**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Poitevin</span>, Assistant Professor at the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, 200<span style="font-size: 12pt;">1</span> (Rene Francisco, “The end of ant-capitalism as we knew it,” Socialist Review, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3952/is_200101/ai_n8932891)
Let me finish by addressing the "vision....<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> some reformist agenda is not going to do it either</span>.
