==PLAN== 

**The United States federal government should increase its infrastructure investments by increasing the number of public buses in operation by 50 percent and replacing the entire fleet over the next five years focusing on improving the energy efficiency and quality of the operating bus fleet**
==ADVANTAGE 1 – IS THE ECONOMY==
