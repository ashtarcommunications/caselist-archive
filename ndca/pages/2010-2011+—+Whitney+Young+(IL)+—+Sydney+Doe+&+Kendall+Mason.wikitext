**Plan: The United States federal government should remove its military presence from the Okinawa Prefecture in Japan.**

The U.S. is ignoring local opposition to the Okinawa bases in the prefecture. To add injury to insult they are now moving on with plans to restructure the runways in Futenma and build a new base at Nago.

//If the possibility existed of a mistaken preemption during and immediately after the Cold War, between the experienced nuclear forces and command systems of America and Russia, then it may be a matter of even more concern with regard to states with newer and more opaque forces and command systems. In addition, the Americans and Soviets (and then Russians) had a great deal of experience getting to know one another’s military operational proclivities and doctrinal idiosyncrasies, including those that might influence the decision for or against war. Another consideration, relative to nuclear stability in the present century, is that the Americans and their NATO allies shared with the Soviets and Russians a commonality of culture and historical experience. __Future <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">threats to American or Russian ...</span>____<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext;">these expectations for the obsolescence or marginalization of major interstate warfare</span>__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span>//
