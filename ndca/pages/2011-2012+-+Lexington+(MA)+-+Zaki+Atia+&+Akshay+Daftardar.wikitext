If you're hitting us make sure to flow Zaki's 2NC well because he won't tell you anything. Also, he reads fiat not real so make sure to have answers to his bullshit Schlag cards. My 1NRs on politics are a work of art, the diversionary tactics that I employ in order to make sure you undercover the K so the tururist has something to go for, are utterly astounding.
