**Thus the judge should affirm the 1AC as a way to actively criticize transportation policy through the endorsement of our pedagogical stance against the biopolitics of disposability and the creation of a radical party.**

==**Biopolitics of Disposability 1AC**== 
**The train has left the station, and with it, it has taken its white power while leaving behind the largely ignored black population to live a life of horror and subjugation. This train left when Katrina hit, as the federal government showed its true concern for the people of New Orleans when they left them there to die**

The train has left the station...one must travel backward in time

**There is no such thing as accident, everything happens for a reason and even Katrina had a reason. It was because of the large neglect of the black body that the federal government had suppressed, showing that transportation policies are LARGELY shaped by the color of ones skin.**
**Zeleza 2k5**
(Paul Tiyambe Zeleza, Professor of Economics and a Novelist, “The political wrath of Hurricane Katrina” [[http://www.blackcommentator.com/150/150_zeleza_katrina.html]], September 15th 2005, DM)
Like most people in the United States....<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">the levees that keep New Orleans a livable city below sea level would break</span>

**This form of politics is what leads to the bio politics of disposability. Politics based on racial divisions are clear indicators that black people and people in poverty ARE the disposable population. This is what leads to people living in death row constantly worrying about their lives as they fall victim to these oppressive policies and strategic neglect.**

The Bush administration's ideological hostility...disposable in the age of neoliberal global capitalism

**Thus the judge should affirm the 1AC as a critical interrogation for the racial and economic logic of disposability within American transportation policies.**

**We must use the debate space to promote a pedagogical stance against the federal government policies regarding transportation is the ONLY effective way we can __[[#|spark]]__ agency. Thus the role of the ballot is to embrace the pedagogical stance of the affirmative, you are the Paulo Freire of the debate community, using education as a starting point to orient movements against the state**

Katrina revels that we are living in dark times....outside of the schools

**Only by critical questioning of current federal policies and their implications on oppressed populations can we truly create a more ethical politics where we don’t treat population as disposable. Failure to continuously question powerful elites is what causes subjugation and results in atrocities like Katrina.**

Writing recently...and why?


**This form of politics is what leads to the bio politics of disposability. Politics based on racial divisions are clear indicators that black people and people in poverty ARE the disposable population. This is what leads to people living in death row constantly worrying about their lives as they fall victim to these oppressive policies and strategic neglect. Our alternative is to reject the affirmatives capitalist notions in favor for a radical party that orients movements against the state.**

The train has left the station...one must travel backward in time


**This train is what causes the screen memories that disable political movements. The affirmative suffers from the epistemology of ignorance that tries to engage within the political sphere failing to realize that there is NO way for minorities to participate within the political system. From Plessy v. Ferguson, to the Civil Rights movements, the call for legislative action has deemed subjugation while creating a screen memory of the state about their selective actions**.

**Selective memory is what caused Katrina, and what causes subjugation within the political system that deems certain populations as being inherently disposable. The law is not an ethical method for us to participate and it is what gives false hope for change that never occurs, because the train has left the station with the black people being left at the station.**

**We need to get off the station. Break away from this idea of selective memory that gives us false sense of progress and change within our community and allow for free association. This is a process by which we engage outside the legislative process in hopes for greater change, a call for direct action with center analysis of those disposed by the state.**

<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">**The affirmative suffers from an epistemology of ignorance. The knowledge production that they engage in ensures the omission of the original accumulation: slavery, the heart and soul of civil societies and formation of America. This ignorance is what preserves the white supremacist system that antagonizes the black body, as we are fundamentally unable to challenge it.** </span>

When I was a young student at Columbia....or a filmmaker


**This form of selective memory is what allows for the bill of sale. The affirmative is a product of the bill of sale, this allows for the mass genocide of the indigenous culture, and the exploitation and violence upon the black body, and even now with the exploitation and social antagonism of the black body. Their call for investment in transportation infrastructure as a “legitimate” action through the legal system that only serves as a camouflage of Western modernity (WHITE SUPREMACY), failing to realize that this bill of sale is only repetition of history that perpetrates the supremacist state, and no decision of transportation is therefore legitimate**

===Octas Inclusion=== 
The affirmative is nothing more than white supremacy’s attempt to take the alien body/presence and integrate it into the localities of whiteness- this inclusion of the “other” is simply another way in which white hegemony makes minorities take on the white identity even if it is the so called enemy population- this multiculturalist white supremacy is crucial to the project of white supremacist globality. The aff makes just makes the system that secure white supremacy more elastic and durable
