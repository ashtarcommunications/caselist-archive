<strong>a) Evolution proves violence is inevitable and explains realism</strong><br />

<br />
The central issue here is what causes states to behave as offensive realists predict. Mearsheimer advances a powerful argument that anarchy is the fundamental cause of such behavior. The fact that there is no world government compels the leaders of states to take steps to ensure their security, such as striving to have a powerful military, aggressing when forced to do so, and forging and maintaining alliances. This is what neorealists call a self-help system: leaders of states are forced to take these steps because nothing else can guarantee their security in the anarchic world of international relations. I argue that evolutionary theory also offers a fundamental cause for offensive realist behavior. Evolutionary theory explains why individuals are motivated to act as offensive realism expects, whether an individual is a captain of industry or a conquistador. My argument is that anarchy is even more important than most scholars of international relations recognize. The human environment of evolutionary adaptation was anarchic; our ancestors lived in a state of nature in which resources were poor and dangers from other humans and the environment were great—so great that it is truly remarkable that a mammal standing three feet high—without claws or strong teeth, not particularly strong or swift—survived and evolved to become what we consider human. Humans endured because natural selection gave them the right behaviors to last in those conditions. This environment produced the behaviors examined here: egoism, domination, and the in-group/out-group distinction. These specific traits are sufficient to explain why leaders will behave, in the proper circumstances, as offensive realists expect them to behave. That is, even if they must hurt other humans or risk injury to themselves, they will strive to maximize their power, defined as either control over others (for example, through wealth or leadership) or control over ecological circumstances (such as meeting their own and their family's or tribes need for food, shelter, or other resources).<br />

Research from all angles has produced convincing evidence that some features of violence are remarkably similar across time and space. These commonalities comprise: the sex distribution of people involved in fighting (mostly men); the approximate age at which people are most likely to engage in violence (about &amp;' to 0)); essential goals over which fights are fought (material resources, power, and sex); situations that are prone to violence (e.g. humiliations in the presence of others); individual characteristics associated with violence (e.g. courage and risk-seeking); and emotional processes involved in violent encounters (e.g. arousal and anger). Such commonalities are difficult to understand from a purely cultural perspective. Rather, it is becoming increasingly clear that any general theory of violence will need to integrate an evolutionary perspective on human nature (Pinker +,,+). In an insightful paper, Wood (+,,/) has recently laid out how and why an evolutionary perspective is an essential element for the way social scientists understand violence both historically and across societies. On the most general level, an evolutionary perspective serves as a corrective to the view, long cherished amongst social scientists, that the human mind is essentially a blank slate, ready to store and retrieve whatever happens to characterize a given culture (Pinker +,,+). In contrast, evolutionary psychologists emphasize that the “hardwired” architecture of our brain evolved over long periods of time as a solution to the adaptive problems posed by the environmental conditions and problems in the ancestral world (Tooby and Cosmides &amp;((+). Hence the human brain is theorized to be a network of “regulatory circuits” that “organize the way we interpret our experiences, inject certain recurrent concepts and motivations into our mental life, and provide universal frames of meaning that allow us to understand the actions and intentions of others” (Tooby and Cosmides &amp;((/). In developing answers to these questions Buss and Shackelford (&amp;((/) suggest that aggression is a highly context-specific collection of strategies that have evolved as an adaptation to recurrent problems that humans were confronted with during the history of human evolution. They may be grouped into strategies of proactive aggression developed to in#ict costs on rivals and reactive strategies that have developed to deter rivals and to defend one’s interests. The proactive use of aggression entails violence as means to gain access to resources that are valuable for reproduction (land, water, food); as a strategy to win in competitions against intrasexual rivals; and a way to negotiate status and power hierarchies. Reactive uses include strategies where violence is used to defend against attack, situations where it serves as a way to gain a reputation as aggressive in order to deter rivals from future aggression, and reactions that deter longterm mates from sexual infidelity (jealousy).<br />

It is clear that this violence was largely perpetrated by men. While small minorities of human societies have been matrilineal, evidence of a primordial matriarchy in which women dominated men, or were even relatively equal to men, has been hard to find. There was no age of innocence. The line from chimp to modern man is continuous.<br />
It would seem, then, that there is something to the contention of many feminists that phenomena like aggression, violence, war, and intense competition for dominance in a status hierarchy are more closely associated with men than women. Theories of international relations like realism that see international politics as a remorseless struggle for power are in fact what feminist call a gendered perspective, describing the behavior of states controlled by men rather than states per se. A world run by women would follow different rules, it would appear, and it is toward that sort of world that all postindustrial or Western societies are moving. As women gain power in these countries, the latter should become less aggressive, adventurous, competitive and violent.<br />
The problem with the feminist view is that is sees these attitudes toward violence, power, status as wholly the products of a patriarchal culture, whereas in fact it appears they are rooted in biology. This makes these attitudes harder to change in men and consequently in societies. Despite the rise of women, men will continue to play a major, if not dominant, part in the governance of postindustrial countries, not to mention less-developed ones. The realms of war and international politics in particular will remain controlled by men for longer than many feminists would like. Most important, the task of resocializing men to be more like women - that is, less violent - will run into limits. What is bred in the bone cannot be altered easily by changes in culture and ideology.<br />

<strong>Gender isn’t the root cause of war</strong><br />
<strong>Goldstein, IR prof, 1—</strong>Professor of International Relations at American University, 2001 (Joshua S., War and Gender: How Gender Shapes the War System and Vice Versa, pp.411-412)<br />
<br />
I began this book hoping to contribute in some way to a deeper understanding of war – an understanding that would improve the chances of someday achieving real peace, by deleting war from our human repertoire. In following the thread of gender running through war, I found the deeper understanding I had hoped for – a multidisciplinary and multilevel engagement with the subject. Yet I became somewhat more pessimistic about how quickly or easily war may end. The war system emerges, from the evidence in this book, as relatively ubiquitous and robust. Efforts to change this system must overcome several dilemmas mentioned in this book. First, peace activists face a dilemma in thinking about causes of war and working for peace. Many peace scholars and activists support the approach, “if you want peace, work for justice.” Then, if one believes that sexism contributes to war, one can work for gender justice specifically (perhaps among others) in order to pursue peace. This approach brings strategic allies to the peace movement (women, labor, minorities), but rests on the assumption that injustices cause war. The evidence in this book suggests that causality runs at least as strongly the other way. War is not a product of capitalism, imperialism, gender, innate aggression, or any other single cause, although all of these influence wars’ outbreaks and outcomes. Rather, war has in part fueled and sustained these and other injustices. So, “if you want peace, work for peace.” Indeed, if you want justice (gender and others), work for peace. Causality does not run just upward through the levels of analysis, from types of individuals, societies, and governments up to war. It runs downward too. Enloe suggests that changes in attitudes towards war and the military may be the most important way to “reverse women’s oppression.” The dilemma is that peace work focused on justice brings to the peace movement energy, allies, and moral grounding, yet, in light of this book’s evidence, the emphasis on injustice as the main cause of war seems to be empirically inadequate.<br />

<strong>Isolating gender as the root cause essentializes women and reinforces oppression</strong><br />

<br />
Building on the notion of hegemonic masculinity, the notion of the citizen-warrior depends on a devalued femininity for its construction. In international relations, this devalued femininity is bound up with myths about women as victims in need of protection; the protector/protected myth contributes to the legitimation of a militarized version of citizenship that results in unequal gender relations that can precipitate violence against women. Certain feminists have called for the construction of an enriched version of citizenship that would depend less on military values and more on an equal recognition of women's contributions to society. Such a notion of citizenship cannot come about, however, until myths that perpetuate views of women as victims rather than agents are eliminated.<br />
One such myth is the association of women with peace, an association that has been invalidated through considerable evidence of women's support for men's wars in many societies. 79 In spite of a gender gap, a plurality of- women generally support war and national security policies; Bernice Carroll suggests that the association of women and peace is one that has been imposed on women by their disarmed condition. 80 In the West, this association grew out of the Victorian ideology of women's moral superiority and the glorification of motherhood. This ideal was expressed by- feminist Charlotte Perkins Gilman whose book Herland was first serialized in The Forerunner in 1915. Gilman glorified women as caring and nurturing mothers whose private sphere skills could benefit the world at large. 81 Most turn-of-the-century feminists shared Gilman's ideas. But if the implication of this view -was that women were disqualified from participating in the corrupt world of political and economic power by virtue of their moral superiority, the result could only be the perpetuation of male dominance. Many contemporary feminists see dangers in the continuation of these essentializing myths that can only result in the perpetuation of women's subordination and reinforce dualisms that serve to make men more powerful. The association of femininity with peace lends support to an idealized masculinity that depends on constructing women as passive victims in need of protection. It also contributes to the claim that women are naive in matters relating to international politics. An enriched, less militarized notion of citizenship- cannot be built on such a weak foundation.<br />

<strong>“Rape is worse than death” rhetoric is patriarchal and increases violence against womyn</strong><br />
<strong>Rayburn 4 –</strong> Professor, John Marshall Law School (Corey, 78 St. John's L. Rev. 1119, AG)<br />
<br />
There is a new, but very old, rhetoric buttressing proponents of these death penalty statutes. As long as populations and politicians can make the appeal that rape is an evil worse than death, they can push these laws with a load of Victorian, patriarchal baggage attached. Womyn and children become objects to be owned and controlled and the consequences of the rhetoric can be devastating on their lives. As long as womyn are told that they would be better off dead than raped, we will continue to read stories of womyn emulating Maria Goretti and dying as a consequence. Children will continue to feel that their meaningful life is over and suicides and trauma will become more common. Womyn and children will ultimately bear the insidious consequences of linguistic choices shaped by a patriarchal culture. That the adult men in power do not see the consequences of their words and do not think before they speak is nothing new. That they do so in order to support state killing adds substantial weight to the language of domination that they deploy. When womyn and children are nothing more than pawns in a game of politics and crime fighting, the result is sure to be negative for those without political power. When they also regurgitate and propagate notions of personhood derived from antediluvian conceptions of what it means to be raped and violated, the epistemological gap in comprehension creates a doubly blinding effect. Men in power rarely have [*1165] any understanding of rape or child molestation on a personal level. Thus, driving policy aims with a lack of understanding ensures effects outside of their narrow conception of the world. Death penalty statutes derived from belief without foundation and rhetoric without understanding will cause consequences unforeseen to those who could not comprehend the problems in the first place. As a result, the only way to position ourselves against these efforts is to stop them before they gain momentum built on frenzy and hysteria. Allowing capital rape statutes and the notion that &quot;rape is worse than death&quot; to gain a more significant foothold in the legal and cultural realms cannot be easily undone. It must start and stop with Louisiana and efforts to extend other laws around the globe must be similarly opposed. To do otherwise is to replicate and revive Victorian paradigms surrounding rape in a modern society and resubjugate womyn and children under a pernicious patriarchal regime of rhetoric and policy.<br />

Here I wish to note one important point: attention should not be focussed on one single factor to the exclusion of others. This is often done for example by some Marxists who look only at capitalism as a root of war and other social problems, and by some feminists who attribute most problems to patriarchy. The danger of monocausal explanations is that they may lead to an inadequate political practice. The 'revolution' may be followed by the persistence or even expansion of many problems which were not addressed by the single-factor perspective.<br />

<strong>The aff locks in the war system—infinite number of possible ‘root causes’ means that only incentives theory solves</strong><br />
<strong>Moore 4—</strong>chaired law prof, UVA. Frm first Chairman of the Board of the US Institute of Peace and as the Counselor on Int Law to the Dept. of State (John, Beyond the Democratic Peace, 44 Va. J. Int'l L. 341, Lexis, AMiles)<br />
<br />
If major interstate war is predominantly a product of a synergy between a potential nondemocratic aggressor and an absence of effective deterrence, what is the role of the many traditional &quot;causes&quot; of war? Past, and many contemporary, theories of war have focused on the role of specific disputes between nations, ethnic and religious differences, arms races, poverty and social injustice, competition for resources, incidents and accidents, greed, fear, perceptions of &quot;honor,&quot; and many other factors. Such factors may well play a role in motivating aggression or generating fear and manipulating public opinion. The reality, however, is that while some of these factors may have more potential to contribute to war than others, there may well be an infinite set of motivating factors, or human wants, motivating aggression. It is not the independent existence of such motivating factors for war but rather the circumstances permitting or encouraging high-risk decisions leading to war that is the key to more effectively controlling armed conflict. And the same may also be true of democide. The early focus in the Rwanda slaughter on &quot;ethnic conflict,&quot; as though Hutus and Tutsis had begun to slaughter each other through spontaneous combustion, distracted our attention from the reality that a nondemocratic Hutu regime had carefully planned and orchestrated a genocide against Rwandan Tutsis as well as its Hutu opponents. 158 Certainly if we were able to press a button and end poverty, racism, religious intolerance, injustice, and endless disputes, we would want to do so. Indeed, democratic governments must remain committed to policies that will produce a better world by all measures of human progress. The broader achievement of democracy and the rule of law will itself assist in this progress. No one, however, has yet been able to demonstrate the kind of robust correlation with any of these &quot;traditional&quot; causes of war that is reflected in the &quot;democratic peace.&quot; Further, given the difficulties in overcoming many of these social problems, an approach to war exclusively dependent on their solution may doom us to war for generations to come. [*394] A useful framework for thinking about the war puzzle is provided in the Kenneth Waltz classic Man, the State and War, 159 first published in 1954 for the Institute of War and Peace Studies, in which he notes that previous thinkers about the causes of war have tended to assign responsibility at one of the three levels of individual psychology, the nature of the state, or the nature of the international system. This tripartite level of analysis has subsequently been widely copied in the study of international relations. We might summarize my analysis in this classical construct by suggesting that the most critical variables are the second and third levels, or &quot;images,&quot; of analysis. Government structures, at the second level, seem to play a central role in levels of aggressiveness in high-risk behavior leading to major war. In this, the &quot;democratic peace&quot; is an essential insight. The third level of analysis, the international system, or totality of external incentives influencing the decision to go to war, is also critical when government structures do not restrain such high-risk behavior on their own. Indeed, nondemocratic systems may not only fail to constrain inappropriate aggressive behavior, they may even massively enable it by placing the resources of the state at the disposal of a ruthless regime elite. It is not that the first level of analysis, the individual, is unimportant - I have already argued that it is important in elite perceptions about the permissibility and feasibility of force and resultant necessary levels of deterrence. It is, instead, that the second level of analysis, government structures, may be a powerful proxy for settings bringing to power those who are disposed to aggressive military adventures and in creating incentive structures predisposed to high-risk behavior. We might also want to keep open the possibility that a war/peace model focused on democracy and deterrence might be further usefully refined by adding psychological profiles of particular leaders as we assess the likelihood of aggression and levels of necessary deterrence. Nondemocracies' leaders can have different perceptions of the necessity or usefulness of force and, as Marcus Aurelius should remind us, not all absolute leaders are Caligulas or Neros. Further, the history of ancient Egypt reminds us that not all Pharaohs were disposed to make war on their neighbors. Despite the importance of individual leaders, however, the key to war avoidance is understanding that major international war is critically an interaction, or synergy, of certain characteristics at levels two and three - specifically an absence of [*395] democracy and an absence of effective deterrence. Yet another way to conceptualize the importance of democracy and deterrence in war avoidance is to note that each in its own way internalizes the costs to decision elites of engaging in high-risk aggressive behavior. Democracy internalizes these costs in a variety of ways including displeasure of the electorate at having war imposed upon it by its own government. And deterrence either prevents achievement of the objective altogether or imposes punishing costs making the gamble not worth the risk. 160 III. Testing the Hypothesis Hypotheses, or paradigms, are useful if they reflect the real world better than previously held paradigms. In the complex world of foreign affairs and the war puzzle, perfection is unlikely. No general construct will fit all cases even in the restricted category of &quot;major interstate war;&quot; there are simply too many variables. We should insist, however, on testing against the real world and on results that suggest enhanced usefulness over other constructs. In te sting the hypothesis, we can test it for consistency with major wars. That is, in looking, for example, at the principal interstate wars in the twentieth century, did they present both a nondemocratic aggressor and an absence of effective deterrence? 161 And although it, by itself, does not prove causation, we might also want to test the hypothesis against settings of potential wars that did not occur. That is, in non-war settings, was there an absence of at least one element of the synergy? We might also ask questions about the effect of changes on the international system in either element of the synergy. That is, what, in general, happens when a totalitarian state makes a transition to stable democracy or vice versa? And what, in general, happens when levels of deterrence are dramatically increased or decreased?<br />

<br />
The &quot;cause&quot; of the &quot;democratic peace&quot; is likely not any single factor. Rather it is a combination of factors inherent in differences between the culture of democracy and the culture of Hegelian &quot;statism.&quot; These factors probably include: differential incentive structures for regime elites, and particularly the greater ability of such elites in statist systems to externalize costs on others while internalizing the benefits of their actions; differences in leaders assuming power through public appeal versus violence; differences between ideologies of human freedom versus statist ideologies, including pervasive differences concerning the rule of law, modalities for resolution of disputes, and deification of those in power; individual empowerment versus the collective, and many other important differences in subjectivities; higher levels of external trade and international interaction between democracies; greater internal checks and balances on the decision for war; resulting greater democratic nation wealth, which may predispose to greater caution in efforts at risky expansion of values; and many other pervasive differences in culture. Of these, &quot;incentive theory&quot; would suggest that one particularly important factor is likely to be the first on the list; that is, the differential effect on incentives for decision elites from all of these factors together; • Contrary to entrenched conventional wisdom within the social science community, democracies are considerably less likely to initiate aggressive war than nondemocracies. Further, the differences in total casualties between democratic and nondemocratic initiated aggression is overwhelming—on the order of one to a hundred; • Nondemocracies are frequently getting into major war through aggression. A principal path to war for democracies, and an additional path to war for nondemocracies, is an absence of effective deterrence; • An absence of effective deterrence, that is, of effective incentives from the international system, is a crucial factor in major war; • For this latter reason, deterrence, rather than simply levels of power, is a more important variable than power in the origin of major war. A common absence of effective deterrence results from a failure to communicate an intent to deter, whatever the specific reason for this failure; • The democracy/deterrence syndrome is an important recurrent feature in major war; • Because of the importance of deterrence in war avoidance, theory will benefit from a more objective scoring system for measuring levels of deterrence, as we now enjoy with several systems for the scoring of democracy. This book uses an initial effort at such a scoring system developed within the author's War &amp; Peace Seminar; • The practice of deterrence should incorporate behavioral insights from cognitive psychology, particularly including &quot;prospect theory.&quot; Other such behavioral insights should be incorporated into broader theory as relevance is demonstrated; • Incentive theory suggests a focus of deterrence on regime decision makers (that is, reducing their incentives for war), and this feature of incentive theory is already making its way into practice; • Original studies are referenced showing correlations between form of government and terrorism, state involvement in the drug trade, refugee flows, and corruption. These supplement important studies by others showing the correlation between democracy and war, democide, economic development, famine, infant mortality, and environmental protection; • Incentive theory likely is useful in analyzing civil war, terrorism, and minor coercion, as well as major war. Specific key variables and resulting incentives, however, may be different in these settings. For example, civil war does not lend itself readily to an analysis as to which party is an aggressor under international law; • Incentive theory suggests that a crucial role in strengthening collective security is to begin to think about enhancing the role of the United Nations and other collective security mechanisms in deterrence terms; that is, thinking about mechanisms to provide advance deterrence against aggression and democide rather than leaving such action to possible collective action after the event; • Stable trade not only serves to enhance economic development, it also serves to create incentives militating against major war. The effort to remove trade barriers should continue while retaining our sensitivity to labor and the environment; • Effective foreign policy should seek both a long-run strategy of democracy enlargement and a strategy of providing effective deterrence against rogue regimes as needed to deter war, democide, and terrorism; • Democratic nations should work together to strengthen pro- democracy initiatives, such as the &quot;Community of Democracies&quot;; • The United States might want to create a new position of Special Representative of the President for Democracy Assistance; and • The United States might want to add a more focused &quot;warning-response&quot; mechanism to the National Security Council charged with the specific responsibility of formulating and presenting to the President proposals for war avoidance in war crisis settings when alerted to such crises from the intelligence community. It should be clearly understood that the demonstration of correlation does not necessarily prove causation. As such, while this book seeks to integrate the best of the empirical work with the best of the theoretical work, it presents, and can only present, an hypothesis. We should, however, certainly discard theories that are not consistent with the available empirical evidence about war. Similarly, even if &quot;incentive theory&quot; proves a more useful focus in seeking to predict and control war, it does not offer a slot-machine for simple answers. The decision for war is affected by a complex aggregate of incentives. Even rejecting poorer modes of focus will not provide instant answers in specific cases any more than understanding that night air does not cause plague will by itself lead to a discovery of penicillin. Until we set aside pervasive myths about war and focus our attention on the critical variables, we will have little chance to control this age-old scourge of mankind. It is hoped that this book may make an at least modest contribution to its goal.<br />

<strong>Epistemology not first</strong><br />
<strong>Owen 2</strong>—Reader of Political Theory, U Southampton (David, Millennium Vol 31 No 3 2002 p. 655-7)<br />
<br />
Commenting on the ‘philosophical turn’ in IR, Wæver remarks that ‘[<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">a] frenzy for words like “epistemology” and “ontology” </span></span>often <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">signals this philosophical turn</span></span>’, although he goes on to comment that these terms are often used loosely.4 However, loosely deployed or not, it is clear that debates concerning ontology and epistemology play a central role in the contemporary IR theory wars. In one respect, this is unsurprising since it is a characteristic feature of the social sciences that periods of disciplinary disorientation involve recourse to reflection on the philosophical commitments of different theoretical approaches, and there is no doubt that such reflection can play a valuable role in making explicit the commitments that characterise (and help individuate) diverse theoretical positions. Yet, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">such a</span></span> philosophical <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">turn is not without its dangers</span></span> and I will briefly mention three before turning to consider a confusion that has, I will suggest, helped to promote the IR theory wars by motivating this philosophical turn. The first danger with the philosophical turn is that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">it has an inbuilt tendency to <strong>prioritise</strong></span></span> issues of<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">ontology and <strong>epistemology over explanatory and/or interpretive power as if the latter</strong> two <strong>were merely a</strong> simple <strong>function of the former</strong></span></span>. But <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">while the explanatory</span></span> and/or interpretive <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">power of a theoretical account is not</span></span> wholly <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">independent of its ontological and/or epistemological commitments</span></span> (otherwise criticism of these features would not be a criticism that had any value), <span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">it is by no means</span></strong> </span>clear that it is, in contrast, <span class="Underline"><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">wholly dependent on these philosophical commitments</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">. Thus, for example, one need not be sympathetic to rational choice theory to recognise that it can provide powerful accounts of certain kinds of problems, such as the tragedy of the commons in which dilemmas of collective action are foregrounded. It may</span></span>, of course, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">be the case that the advocates of rational choice theory cannot give a good account of why this type of theory is powerful in accounting for this class of problems</span></span> (i.e., how it is that the relevant actors come to exhibit features in these circumstances that approximate the assumptions of rational choice theory) <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">and</span></span>, if <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">this </span></span>is the case, it <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is a philosophical weakness</span></span>—<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">but <strong>this does not undermine the point</strong> that, for a certain class of problems, rational choice theory may provide the best account available to us</span></span>. In other words, while the critical judgement of theoretical accounts in terms of their ontological and/or epistemological sophistication is one kind of <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">critical judgement</span></span>, it <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is not</span></span> the only or even necessarily <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the most important kind. The </span></span>second danger run by the philosophical turn is that because <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">prioritisation of ontology and epistemology promotes theory-construction from philosophical first principles, it <strong>cultivates a theory-driven rather than problem-driven approach to IR</strong></span></span>. Paraphrasing Ian Shapiro, the point can be put like this: <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">since </span></span>it is the case that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">there is always a plurality of possible true descriptions of a given action,</span></span> event or phenomenon, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the challenge is to decide which is the most apt in terms of getting a perspicuous grip on the action, </span></span>event or phenomenon in question given the purposes of the inquiry; yet, from this standpoint,<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> ‘<strong>theory-driven work is part of a reductionist program’</strong> in that it ‘dictates always opting for the description that calls for the explanation that flows from the preferred model or theory’</span></span>.5 The justification offered for this strategy rests on the mistaken belief that it is necessary for social science because general explanations are required to characterise the classes of phenomena studied in similar terms. However, as Shapiro points out, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">this is to misunderstand the enterprise of science since ‘whether there are general explanations for classes of phenomena is a question for social-scientific inquiry, not to be prejudged before conducting that inquiry</span></span>’.6 Moreover, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">this strategy <strong>easily slips into the promotion of the pursuit of generality over that of empirical validity</strong>. </span></span>The third danger is that the preceding two combine to encourage the formation of a particular image of disciplinary debate in IR—what might be called (only slightly tongue in cheek) ‘the Highlander view’—namely, an image of warring theoretical approaches with each, despite occasional temporary tactical alliances, dedicated to the strategic achievement of sovereignty over the disciplinary field. It encourages this view because the turn to, and <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">prioritisation of, ontology and epistemology stimulates the idea that there can only be one theoretical approach which gets things right, namely, the theoretical approach that gets its ontology and epistemology right.</span></span>This image feeds back into IR exacerbating the first and second dangers, and so a potentially vicious circle arises.<br />

As long ago as 1981, Yale Ferguson and Richard Mansbach effectively laid the influence of the dogmatic behaviouralism of the 1960s to rest in their book <em>The Elusive Quest</em>, signaling the profound disillusionment of mainstream IR with the idea that a cumulative science of IR would ever be possible (<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ip/journal/v45/n2/full/8800222a.html#bib6%23bib6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ferguson and Mansbach, 1988</a></span>). The popularity of the ‘naïve’ form of positivism, wed to a view of inexorable scientific progress and supposedly practiced by wide-eyed scholars during the 1960s, has long been a thing of the past. Postmodernists hence do the discipline a disservice when they continue to attack the overly optimistic and dogmatic form of positivism as if it still represented a dominant orthodoxy, which must somehow be overthrown. Equally, supporters of the contemporary or ‘neo-’ version of positivism perform a similar disservice when they fail to articulate their epistemological assumptions clearly or at all. Indeed, the first error is greatly encouraged by the second, since by failing to state what they stand for, neo-positivists have allowed postmodernists to fashion a series of straw men who burn rapidly at the slightest touch. Articulating a full list of these assumptions lies beyond the scope of this article, but contemporary neo-positivists are, I would suggest, committed to the following five assumptions, none of which are especially radical or hard to defend: (1) That explaining the social and political world ought to be our central objective, (2) That — subjective though our perceptions of the world may be — many features of the political world are at least potentially explainable. What remains is a conviction that there are at least some empirical propositions, which can be demonstrably shown to be ‘true’ or ‘false’, some underlying regularities that clearly give shape to IR (such as the proposition that democracies do not fight one another), (3) That careful use of appropriate methodological techniques can establish what patterns exist in the political world, (4) That positive and normative questions, though related, are ultimately separable, although both constitute valid and interesting forms of enquiry. There is also a general conviction (5) that careful use of research design may help researchers avoid logical pitfalls in their work. Doubtless, there are some who would not wish to use the term ‘positivism’ as an umbrella term for these five assumptions, in which case we probably require a new term to cover them. But to the extent that there exists an ‘orthodoxy’ in the field of IR today, this is surely it. Writing in 1989, Thomas Biersteker noted that ‘the vast majority of scholarship in international relations (and the social sciences for that matter) proceeds without conscious reflection on its philosophical bases or premises. In professional meetings, lectures, seminars and the design of curricula, we do not often engage in serious reflection on the philosophical bases or implications of our activity. Too often, consideration of these core issues is reserved for (and largely forgotten after) the introductory weeks of required concepts and methods courses, as we socialize students into the profession’ (<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ip/journal/v45/n2/full/8800222a.html#bib2%23bib2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Biersteker, 1989</a></span>). This observation — while accurate at the time — would surely be deemed incorrect were it to be made today. Even some <strong>scholars</strong> who profess regret at the philosophically self-regarding nature of contemporary of IR theory, nevertheless feel compelled to <strong>devote huge chunks of their work to epistemological issues</strong> before getting to more substantive matters (see for instance<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ip/journal/v45/n2/full/8800222a.html#bib21%23bib21" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wendt, 1999</a></span>). The recent emphasis on epistemology has helped to push IR as a discipline further and further away from the concerns of those who actually practice IR. The consequent decline in the policy relevance of what we do, and our retreat into philosophical self-doubt, is ironic given the roots of the field in very practical political concerns (most notably, how to avoid war). What I am suggesting is not that IR scholars should ignore philosophical questions, or that such ‘navel gazing’ is always unproductive, for questions of epistemology surely undergird every vision of IR that ever existed. Rather, I would suggest that the existing debate is sterile and unproductive in the sense that the various schools of thought have much more in common than they suppose; stated more specifically, postpositivists have much more in common than they would like to think with the positivists they seek to condemn. Consequently, to the extent that there is a meaningful dialogue going on with regard to <strong>epistemological questions, it has no real impact on what we do as scholars when we look at the world</strong> ‘out there’. Rather than focusing on epistemology, it is inevitably going to be more fruitful to subject the substantive claims made by positivists (of all metatheoretical stripes) and postpositivists to the cold light of day. My own view, as the reader may have gathered already, is that the empirical claims of scholars like Der Derian and Campbell will not often stand up to such harsh scrutiny given the inattention to careful evidence gathering betrayed by both, but this is a side issue here; the point is that substantive theoretical and empirical claims, rather than metatheoretical or epistemological ones, ought to be what divides the international relations scene today.<br />

 <br />
<br />
<strong>Predictions are feasible – they can be made logically from empirical evidence.</strong><br />
<strong>Chernoff 9</strong> (Fred, Prof. IR and Dir. IR – Colgate U., European Journal of International Relations, “Conventionalism as an Adequate Basis for Policy-Relevant IR Theory”, 15:1, Sage)<br />
<br />
For these and other reasons, many social theorists and social scientists have come to the conclusion that prediction is impossible. Well-known IR reflexivists like Rick Ashley, Robert Cox, Rob Walker and Alex Wendt have attacked naturalism by emphasizing the interpretive nature of social theory. Ashley is explicit in his critique of prediction, as is Cox, who says quite simply, ‘It is impossible to predict the future’ (Ashley, 1986: 283; Cox, 1987: 139, cf. also 1987: 393). More recently, Heikki Patomäki has argued that ‘qualitative changes and emergence are possible, but predictions are not’ defective and that the latter two presuppose an unjustifiably narrow notion of ‘prediction’.14 A determined prediction sceptic may continue to hold that there is too great a degree of complexity of social relationships (which comprise ‘open systems’) to allow any prediction whatsoever. Two very simple examples may circumscribe and help to refute a radical variety of scepticism. First, we all make reliable social predictions and do so with great frequency. We can predict with high probability that a spouse, child or parent will react to certain well-known stimuli that we might supply, based on extensive past experience. More to the point of IR prediction – scepticism, we can imagine a young child in the UK who (perhaps at the cinema) (1) picks up a bit of 19th-century British imperial lore thus gaining a sense of the power of the crown, without knowing anything of current balances of power, (2) hears some stories about the US–UK invasion of Iraq in the context of the aim of advancing democracy, and (3) hears a bit about communist China and democratic Taiwan. Although the specific term ‘preventative strike’ might not enter into her lexicon, it is possible to imagine the child, whose knowledge is thus limited, thinking that if democratic Taiwan were threatened by China, the UK would (possibly or probably) launch a strike on China to protect it, much as the UK had done to help democracy in Iraq. In contrast to the child, readers of this journal and scholars who study the world more thoroughly have factual information (e.g. about the relative military and economic capabilities of the UK and China) and hold some cause-and-effect principles (such as that states do not usually initiate actions that leaders understand will have an extremely high probability of undercutting their power with almost no chances of success). Anyone who has adequate knowledge of world politics would predict that the UK will not launch a preventive attack against China. In the real world, China knows that for the next decade and well beyond the UK will not intervene militarily in its affairs. While Chinese leaders have to plan for many likely — and even a few somewhat unlikely — future possibilities, they do not have to plan for various implausible contingencies: they do not have to structure forces geared to defend against specifically UK forces and do not have to conduct diplomacy with the UK in a way that would be required if such an attack were a real possibility. Any rational decision-maker in China may use some cause-and-effect (probabilistic) principles along with knowledge of specific facts relating to the Sino-British relationship to predict (P2) that the UK will not land its forces on Chinese territory — even in the event of a war over Taiwan (that is, the probability is very close to zero). The statement P2 qualifies as a prediction based on DEF above and counts as knowledge for Chinese political and military decision-makers. A Chinese diplomat or military planner who would deny that theory-based prediction would have no basis to rule out extremely implausible predictions like P2 and would thus have to prepare for such unlikely contingencies as UK action against China. A reflexivist theorist sceptical of ‘prediction’ in IR might argue that the China example distorts the notion by using a trivial prediction and treating it as a meaningful one. But the critic’s temptation to dismiss its value stems precisely from the fact that it is so obviously true. The value to China of knowing that the UK is not a military threat is significant. The fact that, under current conditions, any plausible cause-and-effect understanding of IR that one might adopt would yield P2, that the ‘UK will not attack China’, does not diminish the value to China of knowing the UK does not pose a military threat. A critic might also argue that DEF and the China example allow non-scientific claims to count as predictions. But we note that while physics and chemistry offer precise ‘point predictions’, other natural sciences, such as seismology, genetics or meteorology, produce predictions that are often much less specific; that is, they describe the predicted ‘events’ in broader time frame and typically in probabilistic terms. We often find predictions about the probability, for example, of a seismic event in the form ‘some time in the next three years’ rather than ‘two years from next Monday at 11:17 am’. DEF includes approximate and probabilistic propositions as predictions and is thus able to catagorize as a prediction the former sort of statement, which is of a type that is often of great value to policy-makers. With the help of these ‘non-point predictions’ coming from the natural and the social sciences, leaders are able to choose the courses of action (e.g. more stringent earthquake-safety building codes, or procuring an additional carrier battle group) that are most likely to accomplish the leaders’ desired ends. So while ‘point predictions’ are not what political leaders require in most decision-making situations, critics of IR predictiveness often attack the predictive capacity of IR theory for its inability to deliver them. The critics thus <strong>commit the straw man fallacy</strong> by requiring a sort of prediction in IR (1) that few, if any, theorists claim to be able to offer, (2) that are not required by policy-makers for theory-based predictions to be valuable, and (3) that are not possible even in some natural sciences.15 The range of theorists included in ‘reflexivists’ here is very wide and it is possible to dissent from some of the general descriptions. From the point of view of the central argument of this article, there are two important features that should be rendered accurately. One is that reflexivists reject explanation–prediction symmetry, which allows them to pursue causal (or constitutive) explanation without any commitment to prediction. The second is that almost all share clear opposition to predictive social science.16 The reflexivist commitment to both of these conclusions should be evident from the foregoing discussion.<br />

<strong>Turn—rejecting predictions makes them inevitable—decisionmakers will rely on ideology instead of analysis</strong><br />
<strong>Fitzsimmons 7</strong> (Michael, “The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning”, Survival, Winter 06/07)<br />
<br />
But handling even this weaker form of uncertainty is still quite challeng- ing. If not sufficiently bounded, a high degree of variability in planning factors can exact a significant price on planning. The complexity presented by great variability strains the cognitive abilities of even the most sophisticated decision- makers.15 And even a robust decision-making process sensitive to cognitive limitations necessarily sacrifices depth of analysis for breadth as variability and complexity grows. It should follow, then, that in planning under conditions of risk, variability in strategic calculation should be carefully tailored to available analytic and decision processes. Why is this important? What harm can an imbalance between complexity and cognitive or analytic capacity in strategic planning bring? Stated simply, where analysis is silent or inadequate, <strong>the personal beliefs of decision-makers</strong> <strong>fill the void</strong>. As political scientist Richard Betts found in a study of strategic sur- prise, in ‘an environment that lacks clarity, abounds with conflicting data, and allows no time for rigorous assessment of sources and validity, ambiguity allows intuition or wishfulness to drive interpretation ... The greater the ambiguity, the greater the impact of preconceptions.’16 The decision-making environment that Betts describes here is one of political-military crisis, not long-term strategic planning. But a strategist who sees uncertainty as the central fact of his environ- ment brings upon himself some of the pathologies of crisis decision-making. He invites ambiguity, takes conflicting data for granted and <strong>substitutes a priori scepticism about the validity of prediction</strong> for time pressure as a rationale for discounting the importance of analytic rigour. It is important not to exaggerate the extent to which data and ‘rigorous assessment’ can illuminate strategic choices. Ambiguity is a fact of life, and scepticism of analysis is necessary. Accordingly, the intuition and judgement of decision-makers will always be vital to strategy, and attempting to subordinate those factors to some formulaic, deterministic decision-making model would be both undesirable and unrealistic. All the same, there is danger in the opposite extreme as well. Without careful analysis of what is relatively likely and what is relatively unlikely, what will be the possible bases for strategic choices? A decision-maker with no faith in prediction is left with little more than a set of worst-case scenarios and his existing beliefs about the world to confront the choices before him. Those beliefs may be more or less well founded, but if they are not made explicit and subject to analysis and debate regarding their application to particular strategic contexts, they remain only beliefs and premises, rather than rational judgements. Even at their best, such decisions are likely to be poorly understood by the organisations charged with their implementation. At their worst, such decisions may be poorly understood by the decision-makers themselves.<br />

<strong>Arguments why predictions aren’t 100% accurate aren’t a reason to reject them</strong><br />

In the social sciences the explanations of state behaviour in rational-choice theory, which posits the existence of a rationally behaving state, or in economics, which posits the existence of ‘the rational economic person’, are clearly idealisations. However, these are parallel to – and not completely disconnected from – the postulation of laws governing frictionless machines or ideal gases in the physical sciences. With regard to underlying and immediate causes, Bernstein et al. advance a number of points in the course of offering the critique of ‘predictiveness’ of IR theory and the scenario-based alternative that Bernstein et al. present. The main point to be made with respect to the use made by Bernstein et al. of the ‘uncertain relationships between underlying and immediate causes’ is that, in their view, such a connection ‘makes point prediction extraordinarily difficult’ (2000: 47). As will become clear, this chapter argues that IR theorists offer non-point predictions and that such predictions are often of genuine policy value. A statement like ‘a rapid withdrawal of US military forces from Iraq after the defeat of Saddam Hussein is likely to lead to increased violence and long-term instability’, would not qualify as a point prediction. Yet it is the sort of prediction that policymakers typically rely on and it has value for policy-makers. Bernstein et al. thus commit a straw-person fallacy, as do other critics of ‘predictiveness’ discussed above. They raise the bar of ‘prediction’ much too high. The sort of prediction that policy-makers need is often much less than ‘point prediction’. <strong>One may grant</strong> Bernstein et al. <strong>all</strong> of <strong>their points</strong> <strong>seeking to undermine</strong> point <strong>prediction and still conclude that they have not provided good reason to reject</strong> many sorts of statements that satisfy the requirements of <strong>prediction</strong>, as laid out in the definition on p. 8. With regard to learning, IR differs from predictive natural sciences in that, according to Bernstein et al., ‘[m]olecules do not learn from experience. People do, or think they do. … We know that expectations and behavior are influenced by experience, one’s own and others’ (2000: 47). They argue that US policies visàvis the USSR were a response to the failure of appeasement in the 1930s, and those policies were a response to British leaders’ belief that more aggressive policies failed to keep peace in 1914. They cite concepts like ‘chain reactions’ and ‘contagion effects’ to describe these phenomena and hazard analysis for their measurement. But they charge that these do not succeed in explaining ‘how and why these patterns emerge and persist’ (Bernstein et al. 2000: 47). They note also that theories that attempt to predict the future predict incorrectly in part because groups (often states) react in such a way as to prevent their predictions from obtaining. ‘Human prophecies … are often self-negating’ (Bernstein et al. 2000: 52). Another approach that has considerable explanatory success is cybernetic theory, which lays out mechanisms and may even be viewed as predictive. Cybernetic theory was developed by Wiener (1949) and applied to IR especially by Deutsch et. al (1957), and specifically to foreign-policy decision-making by Steinbruner (1974), Chernoff (1995) and others. It not only accords with the data but offers a causal mechanism to account for the patterns. Bernstein et al. argue that actors can change ‘the rules of the game’ and consequently ‘general theories of process in international relations will have restricted validity’ (Bernstein et al. 2000: 52). Generalisations will apply only to ‘discrete portions’ of history. They add that ‘scholars need to specify carefully the temporal and geographic domains to which their theories are applicable. We suspect those domains are often narrower and more constrained than is generally accepted’ (Bernstein et al. 2000: 52). This is, however, just what one of the most systematic and generalising of all IR scholars, i.e., Waltz, demands. He maintains that a body of propositions does not even qualify as a theory unless it so specifies. Once these restrictions on domain are specified, theoretical generalisations might have value. For example, Waltz says that whether we are interested in natural sciences or social sciences, ‘[n]o matter what the subject, we have to bound the domain of our concern, to organize it, to simplify the materials we deal with, to concentrate on the central tendencies, and to single out the strongest propelling forces’ (1979: 68). He later adds, ‘[t]o be a success … a theory has to show how international politics can be conceived of as a domain distinct from economic, social, and other international domains that one may conceive of ’ (1979: 79). So it is not accurate to suggest that IR theorists, at least careful ones, do not bound or constrain the scope of their studies and generalisations. While bounded theories may offer predictions, the fallible nature of all empirical knowledge and the probabilistic nature of IR laws does restrict what can be predicted. The longer the chain of reasoning and the greater the number of probabilistic propositions that are conjoined, the less one may rely on the predicted event. <strong>But this is an argument for limitations on certain types of predictions, not an argument against the predictiveness of</strong> IR or <strong>social science theory</strong>. Bernstein et al. note also that there is the problem of the ‘single case’. They correctly observe that policy-makers often worry about a single instance of an event type (e.g., possible war with our neighbours on our western frontier in the next year) rather than with general propositions (e.g., the problem of war in general, or great-power war, etc.). First, with regard to the relevance of theory to policy, it is important to note that policy-makers do sometimes care about longrun patterns or generalisations in some of their decision-situations. Long-run generalisations are very frequently important for policy-makers. For example, in the 1990s, numerous new states emerged in Europe and central Asia due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of its domination of central eastern Europe. Policy-makers had to understand as correctly as possible the truth of generalisations in DP theory in order to decide how much in the way of financial and diplomatic resources should be committed to help promote democratic polities in the region. Policy-makers in 1994 were not primarily worried about a specific war, say, between Hungary and Slovakia, but rather the long-run chances of conflict arising in a Europe with many nondemocratic states as compared to a Europe with very few such states. Policy-makers could consider two alternative scenarios of the future. One is a Europe with some democratic states and many non-democratic ones, possibly including a non-democratic Russia. The other one envisions a Europe with virtually all democratic states. The generalisations about the effects of democracy on behaviour would allow policy-makers to draw general conclusions about peace and international stability from each scenario.<br />

<strong>Predictions might not be accurate, but that’s a reason they should read specific take-outs</strong><br />

<br />
Much has been made about the defining role of uncertainty in strategic plan- ning since the end of the Cold War. With the end of bipolar competition, so the argument goes, and the accelerating pace of change in technology and inter- national political and economic relations, forecasting world events even a few years into the future has become exceedingly difficult. Indeed, few in the year 2000 would have described with much accuracy the current conditions facing national-security decision-makers. Moreover, history offers ample evidence, from the Schlieffen Plan to the Soviet economy, that rigid planning creates risks of catastrophic failure. Clearly, uncertainty demands an appreciation for the importance of flexibility in strategic planning. For all of its importance, however, recognition of uncertainty poses a dilemma for strategists: in predicting the future, they are likely to be wrong; but in resisting prediction, they risk clouding the rational bases for making strategic choices. Over-confidence in prediction may lead to good preparation for the wrong future, but wholesale dismissal of prediction may lead a strategist to spread his resources too thinly. In pursuit of flexibility, he ends up well pre- pared for nothing. A natural compromise is to build strategies that are robust across multiple alternative future events but are still tailored to meet the chal- lenges of the most likely future events. Recent US national security strategy, especially in the Department of Defense, has veered from this middle course and placed too much emphasis on the role of uncertainty. This emphasis, paradoxically, illustrates the hazards of both too much allowance for uncertainty and too little. Current policies on nuclear-force planning and the results of the recent Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) are examples of overreaching for strategic flexibility. The record of planning for post-war operations in Iraq, by contrast, indicates that decision-makers, in enlisting uncertainty as a rationale for discounting one set of predictions, have fallen prey to overconfidence in their own alternative set of predictions. A more balanced approach to accounting for uncertainty in strategic plan- ning would address a wide range of potential threats and security challenges, but would also incorporate explicit, transparent, probabilistic reasoning into planning processes. The main benefit of such an approach would not neces- sarily be more precise predictions of the future, but rather greater clarity and discipline applied to the difficult judgements about the future upon which strategy depends.<br />

If we know for sure which remedy works, obviously we should apply that remedy. But imagine now that we are uncertain as to which remedy works. The uncertainty is so extreme that each remedy may cure somewhere between three hundred thousand and six hundred thousand children. Nonetheless we have a slight idea that one remedy is better than the other. That is, one remedy is slightly more likely to cure more children, with no other apparent offsetting negative effects or considerations. Despite the greater uncertainty, we still have the intuition that we should try to save as many children as possible. We should apply the remedy that is more likely to cure more children. We do not say: “We are now so uncertain about what will happen. We should pursue some goal other than trying to cure as many children as possible.” Nor would we cite greater uncertainty about longer-run events as an argument against curing the children. We have a definite good in the present (more cured children), balanced against a radical remixing of the future on both sides of the equation. The definite upfront good still stands firm. Alternatively, let us assume that our broader future suddenly became less predictable (perhaps genetic engineering is invented, which creates new and difficult-to-forecast possibilities). That still would not diminish the force of our reason for saving more children. The variance of forecast becomes larger on both sides of the equation – whether we save the children or not – and the value of the upfront lives remains. A higher variance of forecast might increase the required size of the upfront benefit (to overcome the Principle of Roughness), but it would not refute the relevance of consequences more generally. We could increase the uncertainty more, but consequentialism still will not appear counterintuitive. The remedies, rather than curing somewhere in the range of three to six hundred thousand children, might cure in the broader range of zero to all one million of the children. By all classical statistical standards, this new cure scenario involves more uncertainty than the previous case, such as by having a higher variance of possible outcomes. Yet this higher uncertainty lends little support for the view that curing the children becomes less important. We still have an imperative to apply the remedy that appears best, and is expected the cure the greater number of children. This example may appear excessively simple, but it points our attention to the non- generality of the epistemic critique. The critique appears strongest only when we have absolutely no idea about the future; this is a special rather than a general case. Simply boosting the degree of background generic uncertainty should not stop us from pursuing large upfront benefits of obvious importance.<br />

Finally, the planning for post-war operations in Iraq offers another perspec- tive on the tangled relationship between uncertainty and strategy. Problems of predicting the future are at the heart of intelligence analysis and its role in national-security strategy. While few would question the fragility of intelligence estimates or the chequered history of judgements made by the US intelligence community, prediction remains an important part of its mission. Beyond collect- ing and reporting raw information, intelligence organisations are often expected to identify trends and consider the implications of alternative strategies on the behaviour of allies and adversaries. To accomplish this difficult mission, intelli- gence analysts must rely on two crucial resources: good analytic tradecraft that provides transparent standards of evidence, and subject-matter expertise that enables an appreciation for the subtleties of complex human phenomena. But standards of evidence and subject-matter expertise are exactly the sorts of factors decision-makers sceptical of the reliability of prediction might be apt to discount. If uncertainty defines the strategic environment, then what greater insight can the expert analyst bring to bear on strategy than the generalist?<strong>This attitude could marginalise</strong> intelligence <strong>analysis in</strong> strategic <strong>decision-making</strong>. US planning for the aftermath of the Iraq War exemplifies how such mar- ginalisation has played a significant role in recent strategic decision-making. In the judgement of Paul Pillar, the senior US intelligence official for Middle East analysis from 2000 to 2005, ‘what is most remarkable about prewar U.S. intelli-gence on Iraq is not that it got things wrong and thereby misled policymakers; it is that it played so small a role in one of the most important U.S. policy decisions in recent decades’.26 While great volumes of ink have been spilled in the debate over intelligence estimates of Iraqi nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, there is much more clarity about the intelligence community’s estimates of the political environment the US would face in post-war Iraq. Those estimates accu- rately predicted most of the major challenges that developed, from insurgency and sectarian violence to the strengthening of Iran’s geopolitical hand and the galvanising effect on foreign radical Islamists.27 The reported expectations of most key administration officials bore little resemblance to these predictions.28 Rumsfeld’s famous distinction between ‘known unknowns’ and ‘unknown unknowns’ came in response to a reporter’s question on the intelligence supporting assertions of linkages between the Iraqi government and terror- ist organisations.29 The implication of his remark was that presumption of a genuine Iraqi–terrorist linkage was justified because the absence of evidence to support the presumption did not conclusively disprove it. Here, as with the post-war planning assumptions, uncertainty served to level the playing field between facts and analysis, on the one hand, and the preconceptions of senior leadership on the other. Many of the US government’s experts on Iraq and the Arab world outside the intelligence community were also marginalised in the planning for the Iraq War. In 2002, the State Department launched the ‘Future of Iraq Project’ to write a detailed plan for the governance of a post-Saddam democratic Iraq. Participants included dozens of career Middle East specialists from the State Department and the intelligence community, as well as native Iraqis. The project’s report covered a wide variety of topics, from development of a constitution to the management of municipal utilities. In the end, however, leaders in the White House and the Pentagon viewed the report as too pessimistic and ignored many of its conclusions.30 Another well-publicised instance where decision-makers rejected expert advice on weak grounds was the public exchange between Pentagon civilian leaders and the Army chief of staff regarding the number of ground troops required for successful post-hostilities operations in Iraq. One month prior to the invasion, General Eric Shinseki told the Senate Armed Services Committee that establishing security and conditions for political stability in Iraq follow-ing the end of major combat operations would take ‘several hundred thousand’ coalition ground troops. His estimate was based on the application of troop-to-population ratios from previous security and stabilisation operations.31 While fairly rudimentary, the thrust of this analysis was shared by a variety of expert analysts outside the government.32 Two days after Shinseki’s testimony, both Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz publicly renounced the estimate. Wolfowitz told the House Budget Committee that Shinseki was ‘wildly off the mark’, and offered several unsubstantiated and, in retrospect, incorrect predic-tions about post-war attitudes toward American forces among Iraqis and US allies. Having made these predictions, he then proceded to reject the validity of making predictions, insisting that the ‘most fundamental point is that we simply cannot predict ... we have no idea what we will need unless and until we get there on the ground’.33 In effect, by denying the validity of prediction, Wolfowitz locked himself into a very specific but implicit prediction that conformed to his own preconceptions. The point is neither that Army generals are always better qualified to make such judgements than civilians, nor that hindsight shows Shinseki’s judgement to be better than Wolfowitz’s. It is that the grounds for the decision that was actu- ally made on troop levels were conspicuously shakier than those of Shinseki’s judgement, and yet they prevailed. <strong>The mistakes</strong> that were <strong>made in the Bush administration</strong>’s post-war planning for Iraq<strong>are</strong> entirely <strong>consistent with a bias</strong> in decision-making <strong>against the authority of expertise in predicting the future, and</strong> the invocation of <strong>uncertainty</strong> in this instance <strong>became a rationale for rigidity</strong> in planning rather than flexibility.<br />

Various IR theorists have also argued against prediction. For example, Donald Puchala contends that IR theory ‘does not, because it cannot in the absence of laws … invite us to deduce, and it does not permit us to predict’ (Puchala 1991: 79). Interpretivist and reflectivist IR theorists like Ashley (1986), Onuf (1989), Walker (1993) and others, following the lead of critical theorists and predictionsceptic philosophers of social science, argue that IR theory (discussed in Chapter 3) is able to facilitate an interpretive understanding of events and deny that IR theory is capable of prediction or scientific-style explanation. Even though many of these authors hope that IR theory can lead to ‘human emancipation’, their meta-theory undercuts its ability to do so. This trend in the theoretical literature in IR <strong>severs the link between</strong> IR <strong>theory and</strong> any significant ability to aid <strong>policy-makers</strong> to bring about emancipation or any other foreign policy goal. If they do not leave room for rationally grounded expectations about the future, that is, scientific-style prediction, then it will be impossible to formulate policies that can be expected to achieve various aims, including the emancipation of oppressed groups. Without the ability to say that a given action option has a higher probability than any of the other options of achieving the objective, e.g., a greater degree of emancipation of the target group, these theorists cannot recommend courses of action to achieve their desired goals. The loss of this essential capability has been largely overlooked by constructivists and reflectivists in the IR literature. All policy decisions are attempts to influence or bring about some future state of affairs. Policy-making requires some beliefs about the future, whether they are called ‘expectations’, ‘predictions’, ‘forecasts’ or ‘prognostications’. The next step in the argument is to show how such beliefs can be justified.<br />

A radically postmodern line of thinking, for instance, would lead us to believe that it is pointless, perhaps even harmful, to strive for farsightedness in light of the aforementioned crisis of conventional paradigms of historical analysis. If, contra teleological models, history has no intrinsic meaning, direction, or endpoint to be discovered through human reason, and if, contra scientistic futurism, prospective trends cannot be predicted without error, then the abyss of chronological inscrutability supposedly opens up at our feet. The future appears to be unknowable, an outcome of chance. Therefore, rather than embarking upon grandiose speculation about what may occur, we should adopt a pragmatism that abandons itself to the twists and turns of history; let us be content to formulate ad hoc responses to emergencies as they arise. While this argument has the merit of underscoring the fallibilistic nature of all predictive schemes, it conflates the necessary recognition of the contingency of history with unwarranted assertions about the latter’s total opacity and indeterminacy. Acknowledging the fact that the future cannot be known with absolute certainty does not imply abandoning the task of trying to understand what is brewing on the horizon and to prepare for crises already coming into their own. In fact, the incorporation of the principle of fallibility into the work of prevention means that we must be ever more vigilant for warning signs of disaster and for responses that provoke unintended or unexpected consequences (a point to which I will return in the final section of this paper). In addition, from a normative point of view, the acceptance of historical contingency and of the self-limiting character of farsightedness places the duty of preventing catastrophe squarely on the shoulders of present generations. The future no longer appears to be a metaphysical creature of destiny or of the cunning of reason, nor can it be sloughed off to pure randomness. It becomes, instead, a result of human action shaped by decisions in the present – including, of course, trying to anticipate and prepare for possible and avoidable sources of harm to our successors. Combining a sense of analytical contingency toward the future and ethical responsibility for it, the idea of early warning is making its way into preventive action on the global stage.<br />

<br />
In defence of prediction Uncertainty is not a new phenomenon for strategists. Clausewitz knew that ‘many intelligence reports in war are contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain’. In coping with uncertainty, he believed that ‘what one can reasonably ask of an officer is that he should possess a standard of judgment, which he can gain only from knowledge of men and affairs and from common sense. He should be guided by the laws of probability.’34 Granted, one can certainly allow for epistemological debates about the best ways of gaining ‘a standard of judgment’ from ‘knowledge of men and affairs and from common sense’. Scientific inquiry into the ‘laws of probability’ for any given strate- gic question may not always be possible or appropriate. Certainly, analysis cannot and should not be presumed to trump the intuition of decision-makers. Nevertheless, Clausewitz’s implication seems to be that <strong>the burden of proof</strong> <strong>in</strong> any <strong>debates</strong> about planning <strong>should belong to the decision-maker who rejects</strong> formal analysis, standards of evidence and <strong>probabilistic reasoning</strong>. Ultimately, though, the value of prediction in strategic planning does not rest primarily in getting the correct answer, or even in the more feasible objective of bounding the range of correct answers. Rather, prediction requires decision- makers to expose, not only to others but to themselves, the beliefs they hold regarding why a given event is likely or unlikely and why it would be impor- tant or unimportant. Richard Neustadt and Ernest May highlight this useful property of probabilistic reasoning in their renowned study of the use of history in decision-making, Thinking in Time. In discussing the importance of probing presumptions, they contend: The need is for tests prompting questions, for sharp, straightforward mechanisms the decision makers and their aides might readily recall and use to dig into their own and each others’ presumptions. And they need tests that get at basics somewhat by indirection, not by frontal inquiry: not ‘what is your inferred causation, General?’ Above all, not, ‘what are your values, Mr. Secretary?’ ... If someone says ‘a fair chance’ ... ask, ‘if you were a betting man or woman, what odds would you put on that?’ If others are present, ask the same of each, and of yourself, too. Then probe the differences: why? This is tantamount to seeking and then arguing assumptions underlying different numbers placed on a subjective probability assessment. We know of no better way to force clarification of meanings while exposing hidden differences ... Once differing odds have been quoted, the question ‘why?’ can follow any number of tracks. Argument may pit common sense against common sense or analogy against analogy. What is important is that the expert’s basis for linking ‘if’ with ‘then’ gets exposed to the hearing of other experts before the lay official has to say yes or no.’35 There are at least three critical and related benefits of prediction in strate- gic planning. The first reflects Neustadt and May’s point – prediction enforces a certain level of discipline in making explicit the assumptions, key variables and implied causal relationships that constitute decision-makers’ beliefs and that might otherwise remain implicit. Imagine, for example, if Shinseki and Wolfowitz had been made to assign probabilities to their opposing expectations regarding post-war Iraq. Not only would they have had to work harder to justify their views, they might have seen more clearly the substantial chance that they were wrong and had to make greater efforts in their planning to prepare for that contingency. Secondly, the very process of making the relevant factors of a deci- sion explicit provides a firm, or at least transparent, basis for making choices. Alternative courses of action can be compared and assessed in like terms. Third, the transparency and discipline of the process of arriving at the initial strategy should heighten the decision-maker’s sensitivity toward changes in the envi- ronment that would suggest the need for adjustments to that strategy. In this way, prediction enhances rather than under-mines strategic flexibility. This defence of prediction does not imply that great stakes should be gambled on narrow, singular predictions of the future. On the contrary, the central problem of uncertainty in plan- ning remains that any given prediction may simply be wrong. Preparations for those eventualities must be made. Indeed, in many cases, relatively unlikely outcomes could be enormously consequential, and therefore merit extensive preparation and investment. In order to navigate this complexity, strategists must return to the dis- tinction between uncertainty and risk. While the complexity of the international security environment may make it somewhat resistant to the type of probabilis-tic thinking associated with risk, a risk-oriented approach seems to be the only viable model for national-security strategic planning. The alternative approach, which categorically denies prediction, precludes strategy. As Betts argues, Any assumption that some knowledge, whether intuitive or explicitly formalized, provides guidance about what should be done is a presumption that there is reason to believe the choice will produce a satisfactory outcome – that is, it is a prediction, however rough it may be. If there is no hope of discerning and manipulating causes to produce intended effects, analysts as well as politicians and generals should all quit and go fishing.36 Unless they are willing to quit and go fishing, then, strategists must sharpen their tools of risk assessment. Risk assessment comes in many varieties, but identification of two key parameters is common to all of them: the consequences of a harmful event or condition; and the likelihood of that harmful event or condition occurring. With no perspective on likelihood, a strategist can have no firm perspective on risk. With no firm perspective on risk, strategists cannot purposefully discriminate among alternative choices. Without purposeful choice, there is no strategy. One of the most widely read books in recent years on the complicated relation- ship between strategy and uncertainty is Peter Schwartz’s work on scenario-based planning, The Art of the Long View. Schwartz warns against the hazards faced by leaders who have deterministic habits of mind, or who deny the difficult implications of uncertainty for strategic planning. To overcome such tenden- cies, he advocates the use of alternative future scenarios for the purposes of examining alternative strategies. His view of scenarios is that their goal is not to predict the future, but to sensitise leaders to the highly contingent nature of their decision-making.37 This philosophy has taken root in the strategic-planning processes in the Pentagon and other parts of the US government, and properly so. Examination of alternative futures and the potential effects of surprise on current plans is essential. Appreciation of uncertainty also has a number of organisational impli- cations, many of which the national-security establishment is trying to take to heart, such as encouraging multidisciplinary study and training, enhancing information sharing, rewarding innovation, and placing a premium on speed and versatility. The arguments advanced here seek to take nothing away from these imperatives of planning and operating in an uncertain environment. But appreciation of uncertainty carries hazards of its own. <strong>Questioning assumptions is critical, but assumptions must be made in the end</strong>. Clausewitz’s ‘standard of judgment’ for discriminating among alternatives must be applied. Creative, unbounded speculation must resolve to choice or else there will be no strategy. Recent history suggests that unchecked scepticism regarding the validity of prediction can marginalise analysis, trade significant cost for ambig- uous benefit, empower parochial interests in decision-making, and undermine flexibility. Accordingly, having fully recognised the need to broaden their strategic-planning aperture, national-security policymakers would do well now to reinvigorate their efforts in the messy but indispensable business of predicting the future.<br />

<strong>Maximizing all lives is the only way to affirm equality</strong><br />
<strong>Cummiskey 90</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> – Professor of Philosophy, Bates (David, Kantian Consequentialism, Ethics 100.3, p 601-2, p 606, jstor, AG) </span><br />
<br />
We must not obscure the issue by characterizing this type of case as the sacrifice of individuals for some abstract &quot;social entity.&quot; It is not a question of some persons having to bear the cost for some elusive &quot;overall social good.&quot; Instead, the question is whether some persons must bear the inescapable cost for the sake of other persons. Nozick, for example, argues that &quot;to use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a separate person, that his is the only life he has.&quot;30 Why, however, is this not equally true of all those that we do not save through our failure to act? By emphasizing solely the one who must bear the cost if we act, one fails to sufficiently respect and take account of the many other separate persons, each with only one life, who will bear the cost of our inaction. In such a situation, what would a conscientious Kantian agent, an agent motivated by the unconditional value of rational beings, choose? We have a duty to promote the conditions necessary for the existence of rational beings, but both choosing to act and choosing not to act will cost the life of a rational being. Since the basis of Kant's principle is &quot;rational nature exists as an end-in-itself' (GMM, p. 429), the reasonable solution to such a dilemma involves promoting, insofar as one can, the conditions necessary for rational beings. If I sacrifice some for the sake of other rational beings, I do not use them arbitrarily and I do not deny the unconditional value of rational beings. <strong>Persons</strong> may <strong>have &quot;dignity</strong>, an unconditional and incomparable value&quot; that transcends any market value (GMM, p. 436), <strong>but</strong>, as rational beings, persons <strong>also</strong>have <strong>a fundamental equality which dictates that some must</strong> sometimes <strong>give way for the sake of others.</strong> The formula of the end-in-itself thus does not support the view that we may never force another to bear some cost in order to benefit others. If one focuses on the equal value of all rational beings, then equal consideration dictates that one sacrifice some to save many. [continues] According to Kant, the objective end of moral action is the existence of rational beings. Respect for rational beings requires that, in deciding what to do, one give appropriate practical consideration to the unconditional value of rational beings and to the conditional value of happiness. Since agent-centered constraints require a non-value-based rationale, the most natural interpretation of the demand that one give equal respect to all rational beings lead to a consequentialist normative theory. We have seen that there is no sound Kantian reason for abandoning this natural consequentialist interpretation. In particular, a consequentialist interpretation does not require sacrifices which a Kantian ought to consider unreasonable, and it does not involve doing evil so that good may come of it. It simply requires an uncompromising commitment to the equal value and equal claims of all rational beings and a recognition that, in the moral consideration of conduct, one's own subjective concerns do not have overriding importance.<br />

<strong>Ethical policymaking requires calculation of consequences</strong><br />
<strong>Gvosdev 5</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> – Rhodes scholar, PhD from St. Antony’s College, executive editor of The National Interest (Nikolas, The Value(s) of Realism, SAIS Review 25.1, pmuse, AG)</span><br />
<br />
As the name implies, realists focus on promoting policies that are achievable and sustainable. In turn, the morality of a foreign policy action is judged by its results, not by the intentions of its framers. A foreign policymaker must weigh the consequences of any course of action and assess the resources at hand to carry out the proposed task. As Lippmann warned, Without the controlling principle that the nation must maintain its objectives and its power in equilibrium, its purposes within its means and its means equal to its purposes, its commitments related to its resources and its resources adequate to its commitments, it is impossible to think at all about foreign affairs.8 Commenting on this maxim, Owen Harries, founding editor of The National Interest, noted, &quot;This is a truth of which Americans—more apt to focus on ends rather than means when it comes to dealing with the rest of the world—need always to be reminded.&quot;9 In fact, Morgenthau noted that &quot;there can be no political morality without prudence.&quot;10 This virtue of prudence—which Morgenthau identified as the cornerstone of realism—should not be confused with expediency. Rather, it takes as its starting point that it is more moral to fulfill one's commitments than to make &quot;empty&quot; promises, and to seek solutions that minimize harm and produce sustainable results. Morgenthau concluded: [End Page 18] Political realism does not require, nor does it condone, indifference to political ideals and moral principles, but it requires indeed a sharp distinction between the desirable and the possible, between what is desirable everywhere and at all times and what is possible under the concrete circumstances of time and place.11 This is why, prior to the outbreak of fighting in the former Yugoslavia, U.S. and European realists urged that Bosnia be decentralized and partitioned into ethnically based cantons as a way to head off a destructive civil war. Realists felt this would be the best course of action, especially after the country's first free and fair elections had brought nationalist candidates to power at the expense of those calling for inter-ethnic cooperation. They had concluded—correctly, as it turned out—that the United States and Western Europe would be unwilling to invest the blood and treasure that would be required to craft a unitary Bosnian state and give it the wherewithal to function. Indeed, at a diplomatic conference in Lisbon in March 1992, the various factions in Bosnia had, reluctantly, endorsed the broad outlines of such a settlement. For the purveyors of moralpolitik, this was unacceptable. After all, for this plan to work, populations on the &quot;wrong side&quot; of the line would have to be transferred and resettled. Such a plan struck directly at the heart of the concept of multi-ethnicity—that different ethnic and religious groups could find a common political identity and work in common institutions. When the United States signaled it would not accept such a settlement, the fragile consensus collapsed. The United States, of course, cannot be held responsible for the war; this lies squarely on the shoulders of Bosnia's political leaders. Yet Washington fell victim to what Jonathan Clarke called &quot;faux Wilsonianism,&quot; the belief that &quot;high-flown words matter more than rational calculation&quot; in formulating effective policy, which led U.S. policymakers to dispense with the equation of &quot;balancing commitments and resources.&quot;12 Indeed, as he notes, the Clinton administration had criticized peace plans calling for decentralized partition in Bosnia &quot;with lofty rhetoric without proposing a practical alternative.&quot; The subsequent war led to the deaths of tens of thousands and left more than a million people homeless. After three years of war, the Dayton Accords—hailed as a triumph of American diplomacy—created a complicated arrangement by which the federal union of two ethnic units, the Muslim-Croat Federation, was itself federated to a Bosnian Serb republic. Today, Bosnia requires thousands of foreign troops to patrol its internal borders and billions of dollars in foreign aid to keep its government and economy functioning. Was the aim of U.S. policymakers, academics and journalists—creating a multi-ethnic democracy in Bosnia—not worth pursuing? No, not at all, and this is not what the argument suggests. But aspirations were not matched with capabilities. As a result of holding out for the &quot;most moral&quot; outcome and encouraging the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo to pursue maximalist aims rather than finding a workable compromise that could have avoided bloodshed and produced more stable conditions, the peoples of Bosnia suffered greatly. In the end, the final settlement was very close [End Page 19] to the one that realists had initially proposed—and the one that had also been roundly condemned on moral grounds. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:106:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@_Toc105294165&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: _Toc105294165&quot;/&gt; --><a name="_Toc105294165"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:106 --><br />

As a result, the most important political questions are simply not asked. <span class="CardtextChar">It is assumed that U.S. military intervention is an act of &quot;aggression,&quot; but no consideration is given to the aggression to which intervention is a response</span>. <span class="CardtextChar">The status quo ante in Afghanistan is not, as peace activists would have it, peace, but rather terrorist violence abetted by a regime--the Taliban--that rose to power through brutality and repression</span>. This requires us to ask a question that most &quot;peace&quot; activists would prefer not to ask: <span class="CardtextChar">What should be done to respond to the violence of a Saddam Hussein, or a Milosevic, or a Taliban regime?</span> What means are likely to stop violence and bring criminals to justice? <span class="CardtextChar">Calls for diplomacy and international law are well intended and important; they implicate a decent and civilized ethic of global order. But they are also vague and empty, because they are not accompanied by any account of how diplomacy or international law can work effectively to address the problem at hand</span>. The campus left offers no such account. <span class="CardtextChar">To do so would require it to contemplate tragic choices in which moral goodness is of limited utility.</span> Here what matters is not purity of intention but the intelligent exercise of power. Power is not a dirty word or an unfortunate feature of the world. It is the core of politics.

As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, <span class="CardtextChar">an unyielding concern with moral goodness <strong>undercuts political responsibility</strong></span>. The concern may be morally laudable, reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but it suffers from three fatal flaws: (1) It fails to see that the purity of one's intention does not ensure the achievement of what one intends. <span class="CardtextChar">Abjuring violence or refusing to make common cause with morally compromised parties may seem like the right thing; but if such tactics entail impotence, then it is hard to view them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience of their supporters;</span> (2) <span class="CardtextChar">it fails to see that in a world of real violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of powerlessness; it is often a form of <strong>complicity in injustice</strong></span>. This is why, <span class="CardtextChar">from the standpoint of politics--as opposed to religion--pacifism is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; and</span> (3) <span class="CardtextChar">it fails to see that<strong>politics is as much about unintended consequences as it is about intentions</strong>; it is the effects of action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant</span>. Just as the alignment with &quot;good&quot; may engender impotence, it is often the pursuit of &quot;good&quot; that generates evil. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth century: it is not enough that one's goals be sincere or idealistic; <span class="CardtextChar">it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized ways.

The book is in two parts, each containing two chapters. The first part is primarily critical, the second primarily constructive. Chapter 1 tackles normative moral theory on its own terms, arguing that people who make philosophical arguments for why we should alter our moral beliefs or behavior are wasting their time if what they want to do is to alter those beliefs and the behavior the beliefs might influence. Moral intuitions neither do nor should yield to the weak arguments that are all that philosophers can bring to bear on moral issues. I call this position &quot;pragmatic moral skepticism.&quot; It must not be confused with philosophically more radical isms. I am not a moral nihilist, nor an epistemological skeptic or relativist, but merely a limited skeptic, as an example will show. That the Nazis killed millions of defenseless civilians is a fact; its truth is independent of what anyone believes. That the Nazis' actions were morally wrong is a value judgment: it depends on beliefs that cannot be proved true or false. I thus reject moral realism, at least in its strong sense as the doctrine that there are universal moral laws ontologically akin to scientific laws. I am a kind of moral relativist. But my metaethical views are not essential to pragmatic moral skepticism, the doctrine that moral theory is useless, although they help to explain why it is useless. The doctrine is supported by bodies of thought as various as the psychology of action, the character of academic professions in general and of the profession of academic philosophy in particular, and the undesirability of moral uniformity; and above all by the fact that the casuistic and deliberative techniques that moral theorists deploy are too feeble, both epistemologically and rhetorically, to shake moral intuitions. The analogy (of a pregnant woman forced to carry her fetus to term to a person forcibly attached by tubes to a famous violinist for nine months in order to save the violinist from dying of kidney disease) with which Judith Jarvis Thomson defends a right of abortion, and at the other end of the spectrum of abstraction the elaborate contractarian and natural-law arguments that John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis, and others make on behalf of their preferred resolutions of issues in applied ethics, are convincing only to readers predisposed to agree with the philosophers' conclusions. The class of innovators whom I call &quot;moral entrepreneurs&quot; do have the power to change our moral intuitions. But moral entrepreneurs are not the same as academic moralists, such as Thomson and the others I have named. Moral entrepreneurs persuade, but not with rational arguments. Academic moralists use rational arguments; but in part because of the sheer feebleness of such arguments, they do not persuade. Chapter 2 carries the discussion explicitly into the realm of law. I examine issues in jurisprudence, constitutional law, and (to a limited extent) common law and statutory law. I try to show with reference both to individual theorists—Dworkin again, Jurgen Habermas, and others—and to particular cases that moral theory, and such cousins of it as jurisprudence and constitutional theory, are useless in the resolution of concrete legal issues. This is true even when those issues concern such morally charged subjects as abortion, affirmative action, racial and sexual discrimination, and homosexual rights. Consider the constitutionality of laws forbidding physician-assisted suicide, the issue that impelled a group of distinguished moral philosophers led by Dworkin to submit an amicus curiae brief in the Supreme Court that the Court ignored in its decisions upholding those laws. Judges are properly wary about using moral or constitutional theory to decide cases. At the same time, as I illustrate with the Supreme Court's decisions invalidating sex segregation in military academies and a state constitutional provision forbidding local governments to prohibit discrimination against homosexuals, judges are insensitive to the limitations of their own knowledge of the social realities out of which cases arise. They are right to distrust theory that academics press upon them, but they have as yet nothing to put in its place—unless it is an attitude of caution. That is the right attitude in the circumstances. Until judges acquire a better knowledge base, the limitations of moral and constitutional theory provide a compelling argument for judicial self-restraint, although to accept it would be to renounce the dream of many constitutional theorists that the Supreme Court might make over American society in the name of the Constitution but in the reality of radical egalitarianism, Catholic natural law, laissez-Faire economics, or reactionary populism, depending on the theorist. Constitutional scholars would be more helpful to the courts and to society as a whole if they examined constitutional cases and doctrines in relation not to what passes as theory in jurisprudential circles but rather to the social context of constitutional issues, their causes, their costs, and their consequences. This is a neglected perspective, which I illustrate in Chapter 2 by reference to the &quot;real world&quot; effects of constitutional criminal procedure.<br />

The risks from anthropogenic hazards appear at present larger than those from natural ones. Although great progress has been made in reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world, humanity is still threatened by the possibility of a global thermonuclear war and a resulting nuclear winter. We may face even greater risks from emerging technologies. Advances in synthetic biology might make it possible to engineer pathogens capable of extinction-level pandemics. The knowledge, equipment, and materials needed to engineer pathogens are more accessible than those needed to build nuclear weapons. And unlike other weapons, pathogens are self-replicating, allowing a small arsenal to become exponentially destructive. Pathogens have been implicated in the extinctions of many wild species. Although most pandemics &quot;fade out&quot; by reducing the density of susceptible populations, pathogens with wide host ranges in multiple species can reach even isolated individuals. The intentional or unintentional release of engineered pathogens with high transmissibility, latency, and lethality might be capable of causing human extinction. While such an event seems unlikely today, the likelihood may increase as biotechnologies continue to improve at a rate rivaling Moore's Law. Farther out in time are technologies that remain theoretical but might be developed this century. Molecular nanotechnology could allow the creation of self-replicating machines capable of destroying the ecosystem. And advances in neuroscience and computation might enable improvements in cognition that accelerate the invention of new weapons. A survey at the Oxford conference found that concerns about human extinction were dominated by fears that new technologies would be misused. These emerging threats are especially challenging as they could become dangerous more quickly than past technologies, outpacing society's ability to control them. As H.G. Wells noted, &quot;Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.&quot; Such remote risks may seem academic in a world plagued by immediate problems, such as global poverty, HIV, and climate change. But as intimidating as these problems are, they do not threaten human existence. In discussing the risk of nuclear winter, Carl Sagan emphasized the astronomical toll of human extinction: A nuclear war imperils all of our descendants, for as long as there will be humans. Even if the population remains static, with an average lifetime of the order of 100 years, over a typical time period for the biological evolution of a successful species (roughly ten million years), we are talking about some 500 trillion people yet to come. By this criterion, <strong>the stakes are one million times greater for extinction</strong> than for the more modest nuclear wars that kill &quot;only&quot; hundreds of millions of people. There are many other possible measures of the potential loss--including culture and science, the evolutionary history of the planet, and the significance of the lives of all of our ancestors who contributed to the future of their descendants. Extinction is the undoing of the human enterprise. There is a discontinuity between risks that threaten 10 percent or even 99 percent of humanity and those that threaten 100 percent. For disasters killing less than all humanity, there is a good chance that the species could recover. If we value future human generations, then reducing extinction risks should dominate our considerations. Fortunately, most measures to reduce these risks also improve global security against a range of lesser catastrophes, and thus deserve support regardless of how much one worries about extinction. These measures include: Removing nuclear weapons from hair-trigger alert and further reducing their numbers; Placing safeguards on gene synthesis equipment to prevent synthesis of select pathogens; Improving our ability to respond to infectious diseases, including rapid disease surveillance, diagnosis, and control, as well as accelerated drug development; Funding research on asteroid detection and deflection, &quot;hot spot&quot; eruptions, methane hydrate deposits, and other catastrophic natural hazards; Monitoring developments in key disruptive technologies, such as nanotechnology and computational neuroscience, and developing international policies to reduce the risk of catastrophic accidents. Other measures to reduce extinction risks may have less in common with strategies to improve global security, generally. Since a species' survivability is closely related to the extent of its range, perhaps the most effective means of reducing the risk of human extinction is to colonize space sooner, rather than later. Citing, in particular, the threat of new biological weapons, Stephen Hawking has said, &quot;I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet.&quot; Similarly, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin has noted, &quot;The history of life on Earth is the history of extinction events, and human expansion into the Solar System is, in the end, fundamentally about the survival of the species.&quot;<br />

<strong>Biology proves—utilitarian focus on survival is the only accurate framework</strong><br />

Some animals are surprisingly sensitive to the plight of others. Chimpanzees, who cannot swim, have drowned in zoo moats trying to save others. Given the chance to get food by pulling a chain that would also deliver an electric shock to a companion, rhesus monkeys will starve themselves for several days. Biologists argue that these and other social behaviors are the precursors of human morality. They further believe that if morality grew out of behavioral rules shaped by evolution, it is for biologists, not philosophers or theologians, to say what these rules are. Moral philosophers do not take very seriously the biologists’ bid to annex their subject, but they find much of interest in what the biologists say and have started an academic conversation with them. The original call to battle was sounded by the biologist Edward O. Wilson more than 30 years ago, when he suggested in his 1975 book “Sociobiology” that “the time has come for ethics to be removed temporarily from the hands of the philosophers and biologicized.” He may have jumped the gun about the time having come, but in the intervening decades biologists have made considerable progress. Last year Marc Hauser, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, proposed in his book “Moral Minds” that the brain has a genetically shaped mechanism for acquiring moral rules, a universal moral grammar similar to the neural machinery for learning language. In another recent book, “Primates and Philosophers,” the primatologist Frans de Waal defends against philosopher critics his view that the roots of morality can be seen in the social behavior of monkeys and apes. Dr. de Waal, who is director of the Living Links Center at Emory University, argues that all social animals have had to constrain or alter their behavior in various ways for group living to be worthwhile. These constraints, evident in monkeys and even more so in chimpanzees, are part of human inheritance, too, and in his view form the set of behaviors from which human morality has been shaped. Many philosophers find it hard to think of animals as moral beings, and indeed Dr. de Waal does not contend that even chimpanzees possess morality. But he argues that human morality would be impossible without certain emotional building blocks that are clearly at work in chimp and monkey societies. Dr. de Waal’s views are based on years of observing nonhuman primates, starting with work on aggression in the 1960s. He noticed then that after fights between two combatants, other chimpanzees would console the loser. But he was waylaid in battles with psychologists over imputing emotional states to animals, and it took him 20 years to come back to the subject. He found that consolation was universal among the great apes but generally absent from monkeys — among macaques, mothers will not even reassure an injured infant. To console another, Dr. de Waal argues, requires empathy and a level of self-awareness that only apes and humans seem to possess. And consideration of empathy quickly led him to explore the conditions for morality. Though human morality may end in notions of rights and justice and fine ethical distinctions, it begins, Dr. de Waal says, in concern for others and the understanding of social rules as to how they should be treated. At this lower level, primatologists have shown, there is what they consider to be a sizable overlap between the behavior of people and other social primates. Social living requires empathy, which is especially evident in chimpanzees, as well as ways of bringing internal hostilities to an end. Every species of ape and monkey has its own protocol for reconciliation after fights, Dr. de Waal has found. If two males fail to make up, female chimpanzees will often bring the rivals together, as if sensing that discord makes their community worse off and more vulnerable to attack by neighbors. Or they will head off a fight by taking stones out of the males’ hands. Dr. de Waal believes that these actions are undertaken for the greater good of the community, as distinct from person-to-person relationships, and are a significant precursor of morality in human societies. [Continues] “Morality is as firmly grounded in neurobiology as anything else we do or are,” Dr. de Waal wrote in his 1996 book “Good Natured.” Biologists ignored this possibility for many years, believing that because natural selection was cruel and pitiless it could only produce people with the same qualities. But this is a fallacy, in Dr. de Waal’s view. Natural selection favors organisms that survive and reproduce, by whatever means. And it has provided people, he writes in “Primates and Philosophers,” with “a compass for life’s choices<br />

Then, even a one-percentage-point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number, ten to the power of thirty two. So if you take into account future generations as much as our own, <strong>every other moral imperative</strong> or philanthropic cause just<strong>becomes irrelevant.</strong> The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk, because even a tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other, um, benefit you could hope to achieve.<br />

It’s dangerous to be alive and risks are everywhere. Luckily, not all risks are equally serious. For present purposes we can use three dimensions to describe the magnitude of a risk: scope, intensity, and probability. By “scope” I mean the size of the group of people that are at risk. By “intensity” I mean how badly each individual in the group would be affected. And by “probability” I mean the best current subjective estimate of the probability of the adverse outcome.[1] 1.1 A typology of risk We can distinguish six qualitatively distinct types of risks based on their scope and intensity (figure 1). The third dimension, probability, can be superimposed on the two dimensions plotted in the figure. Other things equal, a risk is more serious if it has a substantial probability and if our actions can make that probability significantly greater or smaller. “Personal”, “local”, or “global” refer to the size of the population that is directly affected; a global risk is one that affects the whole of humankind (and our successors). “Endurable” vs. “terminal” indicates how intensely the target population would be affected. An endurable risk may cause great destruction, but one can either recover from the damage or find ways of coping with the fallout. In contrast, a terminal risk is one where the targets are either annihilated or irreversibly crippled in ways that radically reduce their potential to live the sort of life they aspire to. In the case of personal risks, for instance, a terminal outcome could for example be death, permanent severe brain injury, or a lifetime prison sentence. An example of a local terminal risk would be genocide leading to the annihilation of a people (this happened to several Indian nations). Permanent enslavement is another example. 1.2 Existential risks In this paper we shall discuss risks of the sixth category, the one marked with an X. This is the category of global, terminal risks. I shall call these existential risks. Existential risks are distinct from global endurable risks. Examples of the latter kind include: threats to the biodiversity of Earth’s ecosphere, moderate global warming, global economic recessions (even major ones), and possibly stifling cultural or religious eras such as the “dark ages”, even if they encompass the whole global community, provided they are transitory (though see the section on “Shrieks” below). To say that a particular global risk is endurable is evidently not to say that it is acceptable or not very serious. A world war fought with conventional weapons or a Nazi-style Reich lasting for a decade would be extremely horrible events even though they would fall under the rubric of endurable global risks since humanity could eventually recover. (On the other hand, they could be a local terminal risk for many individuals and for persecuted ethnic groups.) I shall use the following definition of existential risks: Existential risk – One where an adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential. An existential risk is one where humankind as a whole is imperiled. Existential disasters have major adverse consequences for the course of human civilization for all time to come. 2 The unique challenge of existential risks Risks in this sixth category are a recent phenomenon. This is part of the reason why it is useful to distinguish them from other risks. We have not evolved mechanisms, either biologically or culturally, for managing such risks. Our intuitions and coping strategies have been shaped by our long experience with risks such as dangerous animals, hostile individuals or tribes, poisonous foods, automobile accidents, Chernobyl, Bhopal, volcano eruptions, earthquakes, draughts, World War I, World War II, epidemics of influenza, smallpox, black plague, and AIDS. These types of disasters have occurred many times and our cultural attitudes towards risk have been shaped by trial-and-error in managing such hazards. But tragic as such events are to the people immediately affected, in the big picture of things – from the perspective of humankind as a whole – even the worst of these catastrophes are mere ripples on the surface of the great sea of life. They haven’t significantly affected the total amount of human suffering or happiness or determined the long-term fate of our species. With the exception of a species-destroying comet or asteroid impact (an extremely rare occurrence), there were probably no significant existential risks in human history until the mid-twentieth century, and certainly none that it was within our power to do something about. The first manmade existential risk was the inaugural detonation of an atomic bomb. At the time, there was some concern that the explosion might start a runaway chain-reaction by “igniting” the atmosphere. Although we now know that such an outcome was physically impossible, it qualifies as an existential risk that was present at the time. For there to be a risk, given the knowledge and understanding available, it suffices that there is some subjective probability of an adverse outcome, even if it later turns out that objectively there was no chance of something bad happening. If we don’t know whether something is objectively risky or not, then it is risky in the subjective sense. The subjective sense is of course what we must base our decisions on.[2] At any given time we must use our best current subjective estimate of what the objective risk factors are.[3] A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization.[4] Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately. There is also a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan for instance, is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently. Such a war might however be a local terminal risk for the cities most likely to be targeted. Unfortunately, we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century. The special nature of the challenges posed by existential risks is illustrated by the following points: * Our approach to existential risks cannot be one of trial-and-error. There is no opportunity to learn from errors. The reactive approach – see what happens, limit damages, and learn from experience – is unworkable. Rather, we must take a proactive approach. This requires foresight to anticipate new types of threats and a willingness to take decisive preventive action and to bear the costs (moral and economic) of such actions. * We cannot necessarily rely on the institutions, moral norms, social attitudes or national security policies that developed from our experience with managing other sorts of risks<strong>. Existential risks are a different kind of beast</strong>. We might find it hard to take them as seriously as we should simply because we have never yet witnessed such disasters.[5] Our collective fear-response is likely ill calibrated to the magnitude of threat. * Reductions in existential risks are global public goods [13] and may therefore be undersupplied by the market [14]. Existential risks are a menace for everybody and may require acting on the international plane. Respect for national sovereignty is not a legitimate excuse for failing to take countermeasures against a major existential risk. * If we take into account the welfare of future generations, the harm done by existential risks is multiplied by another factor, the size of which depends on whether and how much we discount future benefits [15,16]. In view of its undeniable importance, it is surprising how little systematic work has been done in this area. Part of the explanation may be that many of the gravest risks stem (as we shall see) from anticipated future technologies that we have only recently begun to understand. Another part of the explanation may be the unavoidably interdisciplinary and speculative nature of the subject. And in part the neglect may also be attributable to an aversion against thinking seriously about a depressing topic. The point, however, is not to wallow in gloom and doom but simply to take a sober look at what could go wrong so we can create responsible strategies for improving our chances of survival. In order to do that, we need to know where to focus our efforts.<br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> The argument that because we do not know how many species are being extinguished, we should therefore take steps to protect them, is logically indistinguishable from the argument that because we do not know at what rate the angels dancing on the head of a pin are dying off, we should undertake a vast program to preserve them. And it smacks of the condemnation to death of witches in Salem on the basis of “spectral evidence” by “afflicted” young girls, changes that the accused could not rebut with any conceivable material evidence. If something is unknowable at present but knowable in principle, then the appropriate thing is to find out. This does not necessarily mean finding out by direct observation only. A solid chain of empirical evidence can lead to a reasonable conclusion. But there must be some reasonable chain of evidence and reasoning. If something is unknowable in principle, at least with contemporary techniques, then there is no warrant for any public actions whatsoever. To assert otherwise is to open the door to public actions and expenditures on behalf of anyone who can generate an exciting and frightening hypothetical scenario.</span><br />

Reluctant to concede such losses, tellers of the ecological horror story highlight how close a catastrophe might be, and how little we know about what actions might trigger one. But the apocalyptic vision is less credible today than it seemed in the 1970s. Nor is human extinction probable any time soon. Homo sapiens is adaptable to nearly any environment. Even if the world of the future includes far fewer species, it likely will hold people. n215 [*47] One response to this credibility problem tones the story down a bit, arguing not that humans will go extinct but that ecological disruption will bring economies, and consequently civilizations, to their knees. n216 But this too may be overstating the case. Most ecosystem functions are performed by multiple species. This functional redundancy means that a high proportion of species can be lost without precipitating a collapse. n217<br />

Ecologists have long maintained that diversity is one of nature's greatest strengths, but new research suggests that diversity alone does not guarantee strong ecosystems. In findings that could intensify the national debate over endangered species and habitat conservation, three new studies suggest a greater abundance of plant and animal varieties doesn't always translate to better ecological health. At least equally important, the research found, are the types of species and how they interact. Separate experiments in California, Minnesota and Sweden, found that diversity often had little bearing on the performance of ecosystems - at least as measured by the growth and health of native plants. In fact, the communities with the greatest biological richness were often the poorest in terms of productivity and nutrient cycling. One study compared plant life on 50 remote islands in northern Sweden that are prone to frequent wildfires from lightning strikes. Scientist David Wardle of Landcare Research in Lincoln, New Zealand, and colleagues at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences found that islands dominated by few species of plants recovered more quickly than nearby islands with more biological diversity. Similar findings were reported by University of Minnesota researchers who studied savannah grasses, and by Stanford's Vitousek and colleague David Hooper, who concluded that functional characteristics of plant species were more important than the number of varieties in determining how ecosystems performed.<br />

The UK's MailOnline did just that this week under the headline The mini ice age starts here. Lead paragraph? &quot;The bitter winter afflicting much of the Northern Hemisphere is only the start of a global trend towards cooler weather that is likely to last for 20 or 30 years, say some of the world's most eminent climate scientists.&quot; Right. MailOnline reporter David Rose doesn't call them &quot;the world's leading climate skeptics.&quot; He calls them &quot;some of the world's most eminent climate scientists&quot;--and he goes on to cite &quot;Mojib Latif, a leading member of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),&quot; &quot;Anastasios Tsonis, head of the University of Wisconsin Atmospheric Sciences Group,&quot; and &quot;William Gray, emeritus Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Colorado State University.&quot; Contrary to fears of inexorably diminishing Arctic sea ice, Rose cites the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center as reporting that &quot;Arctic summer sea ice has increased by 409,000 square miles, or 26 per cent, since 2007.&quot; Though snow's been unusual for most of the southern half of the United Kingdom in recent decades, the Mail published the accompanying satellite photo of Great Britain during the recent cold snap. The island is essentially all covered with snow. Rose reported record lows as far south as Cuba--something I can attest to, living near Miami in south Florida, where we experienced sub-freezing weather over the weekend. He quoted Tsonis as saying that last week 56% of the United States was covered by snow--something that hasn't happened in several decades. And the &quot;'Arctic oscillation'--a weather pattern that sees the development of huge 'blocking' areas of high pressure in northern latitudes, driving polar winds far to the south . . . is at its strongest for at least 60 years. As a result, the jetstream--the high-altitude wind that circles the globe from west to east and normally pushes a series of wet but mild Atlantic lows across Britain--is currently running not over the English Channel but the Strait of Gibraltar.&quot; Consequently, most of the Northern Hemisphere is much colder this winter than it's been in decades--and the Southern Hemisphere is cooler, too. According to Rose, Latif, Tsonis, and other scientists attribute the cold shift primarily to a shift in the world's dominant ocean circulations--the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation--from a warm phase to a cool phase, something that happens about every 20 to 30 years. &quot;The scientists' predictions also undermine the standard climate computer models, which assert that the warming of the Earth since 1900 has been driven solely by man-made greenhouse gas emissions and will continue as long as carbon dioxide levels rise. They say that their research shows that much of the warming was caused by oceanic cycles when they were in a 'warm mode' as opposed to the present 'cold mode'.&quot; That's a point made by Dr. Roy W. Spencer in the science chapter of the Cornwall Alliance's new document A Renewed Call to Truth, Prudence, and Protection of the Poor: An Evangelical Examination of the Theology, Science, and Economics of Global Warming and illustrated in the graph below. &quot;A significant share of the warming we saw from 1980 to 2000 and at earlier periods in the 20th Century was due to these cycles,&quot; said Latif, &quot;perhaps as much as 50 per cent. They have now gone into reverse, so winters like this one will become much more likely. Summers will also probably be cooler, and all this may well last two decades or longer. The extreme retreats that we have seen in glaciers and sea ice will come to a halt. For the time being, global warming has paused, and there may well be some cooling.&quot; Tsonis also believes that the ocean current cycles dominated global climate change in the 20th century, including the post-1970s, the period many point to as driven by human greenhouse gas emissions, but he doesn't venture to attribute specific percentages to the natural and human causes. &quot;I do not believe in catastrophe theories,&quot; Rose quoted him as saying. &quot;Man-made warming is balanced by the natural cycles, and I do not trust the computer models which state that if CO2 reaches a particular level then temperatures and sea levels will rise by a given amount. These models cannot be trusted to predict the weather for a week, yet they are running them to give readings for 100 years.&quot; Gray went farther: &quot;Most of the rise in temperature from the Seventies to the Nineties was natural. Very little was down to CO2--in my view, as little as five to ten per cent.&quot; Gray, Tsonis, and Latif all agreed that the findings about the ocean currents undermined the credibility of the computer climate models on which the IPCC and other alarmists rely.<br />

New research is claiming that concentrations of carbon dioxide (the main greenhouse gas, CO2) will remain high for at least 1,000 years, even if greenhouse gases are eliminated in the next few decades. The climate scientists who produced this work assert that the effects of global warming, such as high sea levels and reduced rainfall in certain areas, will also persist over this time scale. (The findings are in a paper published in February in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by researchers from the USA, Switzerland and France, www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0812721106 ) Most previous estimates of the longevity of global warming effects, after greenhouse gases were removed, have ranged from a few decades to a century, so this new analysis could represent a development with very serious implications, including political ones. For example, those campaigning for action on climate change could be disheartened and climate sceptics could opportunistically say that nothing should be done because it is now too late. The authors of the paper make various estimates of CO2 concentrations based on the year emissions are cut, assumed to be from 2015 to 2050. They make optimistic assumptions, for instance, that emissions are cut at a stroke rather than gradually, and that their annual rate of growth before cut-off is 2%, not the 3% plus witnessed from 2000-05. They then estimate what the effects would be on surface warming, sea level rise and rainfall over a 1,000-year period using the latest climate models. The results of the melting of the polar ice caps are not included in the calculations of sea levels, only the expansion of the water in the oceans caused by the surface temperature increase so, as the authors point out, the actual new sea level will be much higher. The best-case results for surface warming, where action is taken in 2015 to eliminate emissions, show that over 1,000 years the temperature rises from 1.3 to 1.0 degree centigrade above pre-industrial levels. The worst case, where action is delayed to 2050, predicts surface temperatures will increase from just under to just over four degrees by 2320 and then remain approximately constant for the rest of the millennium. High levels of CO2 persist in the atmosphere because, over long timescales, reduction of the gas is dependent on the ability of the oceans to absorb it, but there are limits to this due to the physics and chemistry of deep-ocean mixing. On the other hand, the amount of heat in the atmosphere that can be absorbed by the sea, the key way surface temperatures are decreased, is limited by the same scientific laws. As a result, carbon concentrations cannot fall enough to force temperatures down while there is simultaneously reduced cooling due to limited heat loss to the oceans.<br />

The U.S. cannot reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere without the developing nations cutting their emissions as well. A 2007 study by the Battelle Memorial Institute found that if China, India and the other developing countries keep growing at current rates, they will emit nearly three times as much carbon dioxide as will the developed countries by the end of this century. But will China and India join in the effort to reduce CO2 emissions? During December's U.N. climate-change conference in Poznan, Poland, I asked delegates from both of these nations if they would agree to cut their emissions. Both said, unequivocally, &quot;no.&quot; The Poznan conference wasn't my first experience with the developing world's refusal to sign up for the West's global-warming agenda. I led the congressional delegation to the infamous Kyoto, Japan, negotiations in 1997, and the story then was the same as now. Without China and India, there can be no deal. It's understandable why the developing nations are reluctant to cut emissions -- it means higher energy costs and reduced growth. China and India are more concerned with growing their economy, expanding access to electricity, and reducing poverty. I don't blame them.<br />

While carbon dioxide is the principal greenhouse gas, methane is second most important. According to the IPCC, Methane is more than 20 times as effective as CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere. US Emissions Inventory 2004 Levels of atmospheric methane have risen 145% in the last 100 years. [18] Methane is derived from sources such as rice paddies, bovine flatulence, bacteria in bogs and fossil fuel production. Most of the world’s rice, and all of the rice in the United States, is grown on flooded fields. When fields are flooded, anaerobic conditions develop and the organic matter in the soil decomposes, releasing CH4 to the atmosphere, primarily through the rice plants. US Emissions Inventory 2004 Water Vapor in the Atmosphere Increasing Water vapor is the most prevalent and most poweful greenhouse gas on the planet, but its increasing presence is the result of warming caused by carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. (See NOAA's National Climate Data Center (NCDC) FAQ page) Water vapor holds onto two-thirds of the heat trapped by all the greenhouse gases.[129] As the Earth heats up relative humidity is able to increase, allowing the planet's atmosphere to hold more water vapor, causing even more warming, thus a positive feedback scenario. Because the air is warmer, the relative humidity can be higher (in essence, the air is able to 'hold' more water when its warmer), leading to more water vapor in the atmosphere, says the NCDC. There is much scientific uncertainty as to the degree this feedback loop causes increased warming, inasmuch as the water vapor also causes increased cloud formation, which in turn reflects heat back out into space. Nitrous oxide Another greenhouse gas is Nitrous oxide (N2O), a colourless, non-flammable gas with a sweetish odour, commonly known as &quot;laughing gas&quot;, and sometimes used as an anaesthetic. Nitrous oxide is naturally produced by oceans and rainforests. Man-made sources of nitrous oxide include nylon and nitric acid production, the use of fertilisers in agriculture, cars with catalytic converters and the burning of organic matter. Nitrous oxide is broken down in the atmosphere by chemical reactions that involve sunlight. Deforestation After carbon emissions caused by humans, deforestation is the second principle cause of atmospheric carbn dioxide. (NASA Web Site) Deforestation is responsible for 20-25% of all carbon emissions entering the atmosphere, by the burning and cutting of about 34 million acres of trees each year. We are losing millions of acres of rainforests each year, the equivalent in area to the size of Italy. [22] The destroying of tropical forests alone is throwing hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. We are also losing temperate forests. The temperate forests of the world account for an absorption rate of 2 billion tons of carbon annually. [3] In the temperate forests of Siberia alone, the earth is losing 10 million acres per year.<br />

Consequently, the best policy is to live with some modest climate change now and encourage economic development, which will generate the capital necessary for investment in the more efficient technologies of the future. Fortunately, we have more time than the alarmists suggest. The warming path of the planet falls at the lowest end of today's U.N. projections. In aggregate, our computer models tell us that once warming is established, it tends to take place at a constant, not an increasing, rate. Reassuringly, the rate has been remarkably constant, at 0.324 degrees F per decade, since warming began around 1975. The notion that we must do &quot;something in 10 years,&quot; repeated by a small but vocal band of extremists, enjoys virtually no support in the truly peer reviewed scientific literature. Rather than burning our capital now for no environmental gain (did someone say &quot;ethanol?&quot;), let's encourage economic development so people can invest and profit in our more efficient future. People who invested in automobile companies that developed hybrid technology have been rewarded handsomely in the past few years, and there's no reason to think environmental speculators won't be rewarded in the future, too.<br />

<strong>No runaway warming</strong><br />

Atmospheric scientists generally agree that as carbon dioxide levels increase there is a law of &quot;diminishing returns&quot; - or more properly &quot;diminishing effects&quot; - and that ongoing increases in CO2 concentration do not generate proportional increases in temperature. The common analogy is painting over window glass. The first layers of paint cut out lots of light but subsequent layers have diminishing impact. So, you might be asking, why the panic? Why does Al Gore talk about temperatures spiraling out of control, causing mass extinctions and catastrophic rises in sea-level, and all his other disastrous outcomes when there is no evidence to support it? The alarmists argue that increased CO2 leads to more water vapour - the main greenhouse gas - and this provides positive feedback and hence makes the overall climate highly sensitive to small increases in the concentration of CO2. Consequently, the IPCC argues that while carbon dioxide may well &quot;run out of puff&quot; the consequent evaporation of water vapour provides the positive feedback loop that will make anthropogenic global warming reach dangerous levels. This assumption that water vapour provides positive feedback lies behind the famous &quot;tipping point,&quot; which nourishes Al Gore's dreams of destruction, and indeed all those calls for action now - &quot;before it is too late!&quot; But no climate models predict such a tipping point. However, while the absence of hot spots has refuted one important aspect of the IPCC models we lack a mechanism that fully explains these supposed outcomes. Hence the IPCC, and its supporters, have been able to ignore this &quot;refutation.&quot; So by the end of last year, we were in a similar situation to the 19th century astronomers, who had figured out that the sun could not be &quot;burning&quot; its fuel - or it would have turned to ashes long ago - but could not explain where the energy was coming from. Then along came Einstein and E=mc2. Hard to explain Similarly, the climate sceptics have had to explain why the hotspots are not where they should be - not just challenge the theory with their observations. This is why I felt so lucky to be in the right place at the right time when I heard Roy Spencer speak at the New York conference on climate change in March. At first I thought this was just another paper setting out observations against the forecasts, further confirming Evans' earlier work. But as the argument unfolded I realised Spencer was drawing on observations and measurements from the new Aqua satellites to explain the mechanism behind this anomaly between model forecasts and observation. You may have heard that the IPCC models cannot predict clouds and rain with any accuracy. Their models assume water vapour goes up to the troposphere and hangs around to cook us all in a greenhouse future. However, there is a mechanism at work that &quot;washes out&quot; the water vapour and returns it to the oceans along with the extra CO2 and thus turns the added water vapour into a NEGATIVE feedback mechanism. The newly discovered mechanism is a combination of clouds and rain (Spencer's mechanism adds to the mechanism earlier identified by Professor Richard Lindzen called the Iris effect). The IPCC models assumed water vapour formed clouds at high altitudes that lead to further warming. The Aqua satellite observations and Spencer's analysis show water vapour actually forms clouds at low altitudes that lead to cooling. Furthermore, Spencer shows the extra rain that falls from these clouds cools the underlying oceans, providing a second negative feedback to negate the CO2 warming. Alarmists' quandary This has struck the alarmists like a thunderbolt, especially as the lead author of the IPCC chapter on feedback has written to Spencer agreeing that he is right! There goes the alarmist neighbourhood! The climate is not highly sensitive to CO2 warming because water vapour is a damper against the warming effect of CO2. That is why history is full of Ice Ages - where other effects, such as increased reflection from the ice cover, do provide positive feedback - while we do not hear about Heat Ages. The Medieval Warm Period, for example, is known for being benignly warm - not dangerously hot. We live on a benign planet - except when it occasionally gets damned cold. While I have done my best to simplify these developments they remain highly technical and many people distrust their own ability to assess competing scientific claims. However, in this case the tipping point theories are based on models that do not include the effects of rain and clouds. The new Nasa Aqua satellite is the first to measure the effects of clouds and rainfall. Spencer's interpretation of <strong>the new data means all previous models and forecasts are obsolete</strong>. Would anyone trust long-term forecasts of farm production that were hopeless at forecasting rainfall? The implications of these breakthroughs in measurement and understanding are dramatic to say the least. The responses will be fun to watch.<br />

<strong>It’s not man made</strong><br />

U.S. climate change research policy is seriously out of whack. There is growing evidence that solar variability is responsible for most of the global warming in the last century ( ED, Dec 15,2004). Coal fired power plants are being blamed for much of this warming, but if it is actually the sun at work then we are wasting time and a lot of money trying to cut carbon dioxide emissions. Clearly the Bush administration should be looking into this solar angle. But it is not, even though its $2 billion a year Climate Change Science Program just underwent a massive review. The CCSP is doing outdated, entrenched science, that assumes humans are to blame for what may well be a natural phenomenon. The problem is that the federal science program was defined 15 years ago. It was assumed then that the climate is naturally unchanging, so humans must be the cause of the observed warming. Since then we have learned that climate, like weather, is never constant, but the research program has not changed accordingly. In the last 6-8 years the sun has emerged as a big driver of Earth s climate change. For example, consider the findings of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which conducts massive periodic reviews of climate science. In 1995 the IPCC said that the sun was not a factor in the warming over the last century. In 2001 it concluded that more than half of that warming was solar induced, not human induced. Given that the IPCC tends to be biased toward the theory of human induced warming, <strong>this was a huge admission</strong>. The scientific trend marked by the IPCC s flip flop has continued. The research problem is that the known variations in solar energy are not strong enough to account for all of the observed global warming. But in the last five years a number of indirect, amplifying mechanisms have been identified. The result is that we now know how <strong>the sun might account for all of the warming</strong>, and there is growing evidence that it does. Research problems do not get any better, or more important, than this. The policy problem is that the CCSP has no plans to do solar-climate research. Because carbon dioxide was assumed to be the culprit, the annual CCSP budget has a $110 million carbon cycle component. But CO2 is a trace gas and the CO2 increase to date cannot explain the observed warming, without assuming a water vapor feedback, so the CCSP also includes a $150 million water-cycle component. There is no corresponding solar-cycle research, what little is done on solar is round-off error. The word solar barely occurs in the new CCSP Strategic Plan, and occurs not at all in the plan s milestones. In short, the climate research program has assumed an old, speculative answer to the warming question (humans are doing it) and is throwing vast quantities of money at that answer. Billions of dollars over the last 15 years. Now that a new answer is emerging (it s the Sun, after all) the CCSP has failed to notice. Clearly its time to put some of these big science bucks into solar climate research. U.S. energy policy hangs in the balance.<br />

Though not a pollutant, it is nonetheless the case that carbon dioxide absorbs space-bound infrared radiation, thereby increasing the energy available at Earth’s surface for warming or increased evaporation (eg de Freitas, 2002). Radiation theory thus accepted, there remain four problems with turning an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide into global warming alarmism. First, the relationship between increasing carbon dioxide and increasing temperature is logarithmic, which lessens the forcing effect of each successive increment of carbon dioxide (Figure 4). Second, in increasing from perhaps 280 ppm in pre-industrial times to 380 ppm now, carbon dioxide should already have produced 75 per cent of the theoretical warming of ~1°C that would be caused by a doubling to 560 ppm (Lindzen, 2006); as we move from 380 to 560 ppm, at most a trivial few tenths of a degree of warming remain in the system. Claims of greater warming, such as those of the IPCC (2001), are based upon arbitrary adjustments to the lambda value in the Stefan-Boltzmann equation, and untested assumptions about positive feedbacks from water vapour. Third, the ice core data show conclusively that, during natural climate cycling, changes in temperature precede changes in carbon dioxide by an average 800 years or so (Fischer et al, 1999; Indermuhle et al, 2000; Mudelsee, 2001; Caillon et al, 2003); similarly, temperature change precedes carbon dioxide change, in this case by five months, during annual seasonal cycling (Kuo, Lindberg and Thomson, 1990). And, fourth, Boucot, Xu and Scotese (2004) have shown that over the Phanerozoic little relationship exists between the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and necessary warming, including that extensive glaciation occurred between 444 and 353 million years ago when atmospheric carbon dioxide was up to 17 times higher than today (Chumakov, 2004).<br />

Claims that climate change is accelerating are bizarre. There is general support for the assertion that GATA has increased about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the middle of the 19th century. The quality of the data is poor, though, and because the changes are small, it is easy to nudge such data a few tenths of a degree in any direction. Several of the emails from the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit (CRU) that have caused such a public ruckus dealt with how to do this so as to maximize apparent changes. The general support for warming is based not so much on the quality of the data, but rather on the fact that there was a little ice age from about the 15th to the 19th century. Thus it is not surprising that temperatures should increase as we emerged from this episode. At the same time that we were emerging from the little ice age, the industrial era began, and this was accompanied by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. CO2 is the most prominent of these, and it is again generally accepted that it has increased by about 30%. The defining characteristic of a greenhouse gas is that it is relatively transparent to visible light from the sun but can absorb portions of thermal radiation. In general, the earth balances the incoming solar radiation by emitting thermal radiation, and the presence of greenhouse substances inhibits cooling by thermal radiation and leads to some warming. That said, the main greenhouse substances in the earth's atmosphere are water vapor and high clouds. Let's refer to these as major greenhouse substances to distinguish them from the anthropogenic minor substances. Even a doubling of CO2 would only upset the original balance between incoming and outgoing radiation by about 2%. This is essentially what is called &quot;climate forcing.&quot; There is general agreement on the above findings. At this point there is no basis for alarm regardless of whether any relation between the observed warming and the observed increase in minor greenhouse gases can be established. Nevertheless, the most publicized claims of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) deal exactly with whether any relation can be discerned. The failure of the attempts to link the two over the past 20 years bespeaks the weakness of any case for concern. The IPCC's Scientific Assessments generally consist of about 1,000 pages of text. The Summary for Policymakers is 20 pages. It is, of course, impossible to accurately summarize the 1,000-page assessment in just 20 pages; at the very least, nuances and caveats have to be omitted. However, it has been my experience that even the summary is hardly ever looked at. Rather, the whole report tends to be characterized by a single iconic claim. The main statement publicized after the last IPCC Scientific Assessment two years ago was that it was likely that most of the warming since 1957 (a point of anomalous cold) was due to man. This claim was based on the weak argument that the current models used by the IPCC couldn't reproduce the warming from about 1978 to 1998 without some forcing, and that the only forcing that they could think of was man. Even this argument assumes that these models adequately deal with natural internal variability—that is, such naturally occurring cycles as El Nino, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, etc. Yet articles from major modeling centers acknowledged that the failure of these models to anticipate the absence of warming for the past dozen years was due to the failure of these models to account for this natural internal variability. Thus even the basis for the weak IPCC argument for anthropogenic climate change was shown to be false. Of course, none of the articles stressed this. Rather they emphasized that according to models modified to account for the natural internal variability, warming would resume—in 2009, 2013 and 2030, respectively. But even if the IPCC's iconic statement were correct, it still would not be cause for alarm. After all we are still talking about tenths of a degree for over 75% of the climate forcing associated with a doubling of CO2. The potential (and only the potential) for alarm enters with the issue of climate sensitivity—which refers to the change that a doubling of CO2 will produce in GATA. It is generally accepted that a <strong>doubling of CO2 will only produce a change of about two degrees</strong> Fahrenheit if all else is held constant. This is unlikely to be much to worry about. Yet current climate models predict much higher sensitivities. They do so because in these models, the main greenhouse substances (water vapor and clouds) act to amplify anything that CO2 does. This is referred to as positive feedback. But as the IPCC notes, clouds continue to be a source of major uncertainty in current models. Since clouds and water vapor are intimately related, the IPCC claim that they are more confident about water vapor is quite implausible. There is some evidence of a positive feedback effect for water vapor in cloud-free regions, but a major part of any water-vapor feedback would have to acknowledge that cloud-free areas are always changing, and this remains an unknown. At this point, few scientists would argue that the science is settled. In particular, the question remains as to whether water vapor and clouds have positive or negative feedbacks. The notion that the earth's climate is dominated by positive feedbacks is intuitively implausible, and the history of the earth's climate offers some guidance on this matter. About 2.5 billion years ago, the sun was 20%-30% less bright than now (compare this with the 2% perturbation that a doubling of CO2 would produce), and yet the evidence is that the oceans were unfrozen at the time, and that temperatures might not have been very different from today's. Carl Sagan in the 1970s referred to this as the &quot;Early Faint Sun Paradox.&quot; For more than 30 years there have been attempts to resolve the paradox with greenhouse gases. Some have suggested CO2—but the amount needed was thousands of times greater than present levels and incompatible with geological evidence. Methane also proved unlikely. It turns out that increased thin cirrus cloud coverage in the tropics readily resolves the paradox—but only if the clouds constitute a negative feedback. In present terms this means that they would diminish rather than enhance the impact of CO2. There are quite a few papers in the literature that also point to the absence of positive feedbacks. The implied low sensitivity is entirely compatible with the small warming that has been observed. So how do models with high sensitivity manage to simulate the currently small response to a forcing that is almost as large as a doubling of CO2? Jeff Kiehl notes in a 2007 article from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the models use another quantity that the IPCC lists as poorly known (namely aerosols) to arbitrarily cancel as much greenhouse warming as needed to match the data, with each model choosing a different degree of cancellation according to the sensitivity of that model.<br />

Many of the proffered global warming policies are designed to help politicians bathe in the warm glow of good intentions, with little or no regard to the mounting costs and infinitesimal benefits. It is a well-rehearsed point that the Kyoto Protocol was a terribly inefficient, hugely costly way to do virtually no good. Even if every industrialised country, including the United States, had accepted the protocol, and everyone had lived up to its requirements for the entire century, it would have had virtually no impact, even a hundred years from now. It would reduce the global temperature increase by an immeasurable 0.15C by the year 2100. The cost of implementing Kyoto, taking the average figure from the various top macroeconomic models, would have been almost £100 billion annually for the rest of the century. The US declined to sign up to Kyoto and many countries, including Spain, Japan, Canada, and Greece, have had a hard time living up to their pledges. It is likely that the total reduction in carbon emissions will be less than 5 per cent of what Kyoto promised. Yet the EU and others advocate that Kyoto-style policies are still right, only that much more than Kyoto is needed. The EU has promised to cut its emissions by 20 per cent by 2020, through a 20 per cent increase in renewables. There seems to be no better reason for this decision than that 20 and 20 in 2020 sounds good. Gordon Brown has wholeheartedly backed the plan, which includes making a dramatic increase in renewables - mainly 3,500 wind turbines in the North Sea. The British Government estimates the cumulative carbon saving from all its plans at somewhere between 950 and 1,100 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030. The Department for Business will not give a figure beyond that timeframe but, given that wind turbines have a lifetime of about two decades, this seems the relevant cumulative reduction given the investment. The department confirms that the total investment from public and private sources into renewables will be about £100 billion. <strong>Computer modelling</strong> - using DICE (dynamic integrated model of climate and the economy) - <strong>shows</strong> that the net effect of the UK renewables effort is impossibly tiny. The temperature increase by 2100 without Mr Brown's plan would have been 2.4536181C. With the best-case scenario the huge UK effort means that the temperature at the end of the century would be 2.4532342C. <strong>The effect is a difference of</strong> about 0.00038C - or about <strong>one three-thousandth of a degree in a hundred years</strong>. This is the equivalent of delaying the temperature increase by the end of the century by a little less than a week.<br />

The United Kingdom is wrong to foist this issue on the Council. First, the extent, source, and consequences of global warming are subject to debate, and the possible implications of global warming, particularly the security implications, are speculative. Even if these consequences occur as predicted in the IPCC report, they are not immediate security threats. Second, numerous policy initiatives, forums, and organizations are focused on studying and evaluating the consequences of global warming. The focus of these efforts and discussions is to clarify the science of global warming and weigh the costs of action to address global warming against the risks of inaction. A debate in the Security Council is unlikely to contribute to these ongoing efforts. Finally, the Security Council has a full docket of immediate threats to international peace and security that is has failed to resolve. Focusing on speculative threats that may arise decades in the future undermines the seriousness of the body and is an affront to those suffering from immediate crises. Worse, it distracts the Council from pressing threats to international peace and security.<br />

<span class="Underline"> There is an &quot;almost vanishingly small&quot; likelihood that terrorists would ever be able to acquire and detonate a nuclear weapon, one expert said here yesterday (see GSN, Dec. 2, 2008). In even the most likely scenario of nuclear terrorism, there are 20 barriers between extremists and a successful nuclear strike on a major city, said John Mueller, a political science professor at Ohio State University. The process itself is seemingly straightforward but exceedingly difficult -- buy or steal highly enriched uranium, manufacture a weapon, take the bomb to the target site and blow it up. Meanwhile, variables strewn across the path to an attack would increase the complexity of the effort, Mueller argued. Terrorists would have to bribe officials in a state nuclear program to acquire the material, while avoiding a sting by authorities or a scam by the sellers. The material itself could also turn out to be bad. &quot;Once the purloined material is purloined, [police are] going to be chasing after you. They are also going to put on a high reward, extremely high reward, on getting the weapon back or getting the fissile material back,&quot; Mueller said during a panel discussion at a two-day Cato Institute conference on counterterrorism issues facing the incoming Obama administration. Smuggling the material out of a country would mean relying on criminals who &quot;are very good at extortion&quot; and might have to be killed to avoid a double-cross, Mueller said. The terrorists would then have to find scientists and engineers willing to give up their normal lives to manufacture a bomb, which would require an expensive and sophisticated machine shop. Finally, further technological expertise would be needed to sneak the weapon across national borders to its destination point and conduct a successful detonation, Mueller said. Every obstacle is &quot;difficult but not impossible&quot; to overcome, Mueller said, putting the chance of success at no less than one in three for each. The likelihood of successfully passing through each obstacle, in sequence, would be roughly one in 3 1/2 billion, he said, but for argument's sake dropped it to 3 1/2 million. &quot;It's a total gamble. This is a very expensive and difficult thing to do,&quot; said Mueller, who addresses the issue at greater length in an upcoming book, Atomic Obsession. &quot;So unlike buying a ticket to the lottery ... you're basically putting everything, including your life, at stake for a gamble that's maybe one in 3 1/2 million or 3 1/2 billion.&quot; Other scenarios are even less probable, Mueller said. A nuclear-armed state is &quot;exceedingly unlikely&quot; to hand a weapon to a terrorist group, he argued: &quot;States just simply won't give it to somebody they can't control.&quot; Terrorists are also not likely to be able to steal a whole weapon, Mueller asserted, dismissing the idea of &quot;loose nukes.&quot; Even Pakistan, which today is perhaps the nation of greatest concern regarding nuclear security, keeps its bombs in two segments that are stored at different locations, he said (see GSN, Jan. 12). Fear of an &quot;extremely improbable event&quot; such as nuclear terrorism produces support for a wide range of homeland security activities, Mueller said. He argued that there has been a major and costly overreaction to the terrorism threat -- noting that the Sept. 11 attacks helped to precipitate the invasion of Iraq, which has led to far more deaths than the original event. Panel moderator Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow at the Cato Institute, said academic and governmental discussions of acts of nuclear or biological terrorism have tended to focus on &quot;worst-case assumptions about terrorists' ability to use these weapons to kill us.&quot; There is need for consideration for what is probable rather than simply what is possible, he said. Friedman took issue with the finding late last year of an experts' report that an act of WMD terrorism would &quot;more likely than not&quot; occur in the next half decade unless the international community takes greater action. &quot;I would say that the report, if you read it, actually offers no analysis to justify that claim, which seems to have been made to change policy by generating alarm in headlines.&quot; One panel speaker offered a partial rebuttal to Mueller's presentation. Jim Walsh, principal research scientist for the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he agreed that nations would almost certainly not give a nuclear weapon to a nonstate group, that most terrorist organizations have no interest in seeking out the bomb, and that it would be difficult to build a weapon or use one that has been stolen.</span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline"> The argument about terrorist motivation is also important. Terrorists generally have not killed as many as they have been capable of killing. This restraint seems to derive from an understanding of mass casualty attacks as both unnecessary and counterproductive. They are unnecessary because terrorists, by and large, have succeeded by conventional means. Also, they are counterproductive because they might alienate key constituencies, whether among the public, state sponsors, or the terrorist leadership group. In Brian Jenkins' famous words, terrorists want a lot of people watching, not a lot of people dead. Others have argued that the lack of mass casualty terrorism and effective exploitation of BW has been more a matter of accident and good fortune than capability or intent. Adherents of this view, including former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, argue that &quot;it's not a matter of if but when.&quot; The attacks of September 11 would seem to settle the debate about whether terrorists have both the motivation and sophistication to exploit weapons of mass destruction for their full lethal effect. After all, those were terrorist attacks of unprecedented sophistication that seemed clearly aimed at achieving mass casualties--had the World Trade Center towers collapsed as the 1993 bombers had intended, perhaps as many as 150,000 would have died. Moreover, Osama bin Laden's constituency would appear to be not the &quot;Arab street&quot; or some other political entity but his god. And terrorists answerable only to their deity have proven historically to be among the most lethal. But this debate cannot be considered settled. Bin Laden and his followers could have killed many more on September 11 if killing as many as possible had been their primary objective. They now face the core dilemma of asymmetric warfare: how to escalate without creating new interests for the stronger power and thus the incentive to exploit its power potential more fully. Asymmetric adversaries want their stronger enemies fearful, not fully engaged--militarily or otherwise. They seek to win by preventing the stronger partner from exploiting its full potential. To kill millions in America with biological or other weapons would only commit the United States--and much of the rest of the international community--to the annihilation of the perpetrators.</span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">We are </span></span>now <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">in an America-centric age</span></span>. To understand this age, we must understand the <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates, not only because it is so powerful but because its <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">culture will permeate the world and deﬁne it</span></span>. Just as French culture and British culture were deﬁnitive during their times of power, so American culture, as young and barbaric as it is, will deﬁne the way the world thinks and lives. So studying the twenty- ﬁrst century means studying the United States. If there were only one argument I could make about the twenty- ﬁrst century, it would be that the European Age has ended and that the North American Age has begun, and that North America will be dominated by the United States for the next hundred years. The events of the twentyﬁrst century will pivot around the United States. That doesn’t guarantee that the United States is necessarily a just or moral regime. It certainly does not mean that America has yet developed a mature civilization. It does mean that in many ways the history of the United States will be the history of the twenty- ﬁrst century<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">.

If that doesn’t convince you, listen to Europeans. They will assure you that America’s best day is behind it. The odd thing is that all of <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">this foreboding was present during </span></span>the presidency of Richard <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Nixon</span></span>, together with many of the same issues. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">There is a</span></span> continual <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">fear </span></span>that American power and prosperity are illusory, and that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">disaster is </span></span>just <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">around the corner</span></span>. The sense transcends ideology. Environmentalists and Christian conservatives are both delivering the same message. Unless we repent of our ways, we will pay the price—and it may be too late already. It’s interesting to note that the nation that believes in its manifest destiny has not only a sense of impending disaster but a nagging feeling that the country simply isn’t what it used to be. We have a deep sense of nostalgia for the 1950s as a “simpler” time. This is quite a strange belief. With the Korean War and McCarthy at one end, Little Rock in the middle, and Sputnik and Berlin at the other end, and the very real threat of nuclear war throughout, the 1950s was actually a time of intense anxiety and foreboding. A widely read book published in the 1950s was entitled The Age of Anxiety. In the 1950s, they looked back nostalgically at an earlier America, just as we look back nostalgically at the 1950s. American culture is the manic combination of exultant hubris and profound gloom. The net result is a sense of conﬁdence constantly undermined by the fear that we may be drowned by melting ice caps caused by global warming or smitten dead by a wrathful God for gay marriage, both outcomes being our personal responsibility. American mood swings make it hard to develop a real sense of the United States at the beginning of the twentyﬁrst century. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">But </span></span>the fact is that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is <strong>stunningly powerful</strong>.</span></span> It may be that it is heading for a catastrophe, but it is hard to see one when you look at the basic facts. Let’s consider some illuminating ﬁgures. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Americans constitute</span></span> about <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">4 percent of the world’s population but produce </span></span>about <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">26 percent of </span></span>all <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">goods and services</span></span>. In 2007 <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">U.S. g</span></span>ross <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">d</span></span>omestic <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">p</span></span>roduct <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">was</span></span> about $14 trillion, compared to the world’s GDP of $54 trillion—about <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">26 percent of </span></span>the world’s <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">economic activity</span></span> takes place in the United States. The next largest economy in the world is Japan’s, with a GDP of about $4.4 trillion—about a third the size of ours. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The American economy is</span></span>so huge that it is <span class="Underline"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;">larger than the economies of the next four countries combined</span></span>: Japan, Germany, China, and the United Kingdom. Many people point at the declining auto and steel industries, which a generation ago were the mainstays of the American economy, as examples of a current deindustrialization of the United States. Certainly, a lot of industry has moved overseas. That has left the United States with industrial production of only $2.8 trillion (in 2006): the largest in the world, more than twice the size of the next largest industrial power, Japan, and larger than Japan’s and China’s industries combined. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">There is talk of oil shortages</span></span>, which certainly seem to exist and will undoubtedly increase. However, it is important to realize that the United States produced 8.3 million barrels of oil every day in 2006. Compare that with 9.7 million for Russia and 10.7 million for Saudi Arabia. U.S. oil production is 85 percent that of Saudi Arabia. The United States produces more oil than Iran, Kuwait, or the United Arab Emirates. Imports of oil into the country are vast, but given its industrial production, that’s understandable. Comparing natural gas production in 2006, Russia was in ﬁrst place with 22.4 trillion cubic feet and the United States was second with 18.7 trillion cubic feet. U.S. natural gas production is greater than that of the next ﬁve producers combined. In other words, although there is great concern that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is </span></span>wholly dependent on foreign energy, it is actually <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">one of the </span></span>world’s <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">largest energy producers</span></span>. Given the vast size of the American economy, it is interesting to note that the United States is still underpopulated by global standards. Measured in inhabitants per square kilometer, the world’s average population density is 49. Japan’s is 338, Germany’s is 230, and America’s is only 31. If we exclude Alaska, which is largely uninhabitable, U.S. population density rises to 34. Compared to Japan or Germany, or the rest of Europe, the United States is hugely underpopulated. Even when we simply compare population in proportion to arable land—land that is suitable for agriculture—<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">America has five times as much land per person </span></span>as Asia, almost twice as much as Europe, and three times as much as the global average. An economy consists of land, labor, and capital. In the case of the United States, these numbers show that the nation can still grow—it has plenty of room to increase all three. There are many answers to the question of <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">why the U.S. economy is so powerful</span></span>, but the simplest answer <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is military power</span></span>. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates completely dominates a continent that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is invulnerable to invasion</span></span> and occupation and in which <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">its military <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">overwhelms</span></span></span> those of <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">its neighbors.</span></span> Virtually every other industrial power in the world has experienced devastating warfare in the twentieth century. The United States waged war, but America itself never experienced it. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Military power and geographical reality created an economic reality.</span></span> Other countries have lost time recovering from wars. The United States has not. It has actually grown because of them. Consider this simple fact that I’ll be returning to many times. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Navy controls all </span></span>of the<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">oceans </span></span>of the world.

<strong>Nuclear primacy solves</strong><br />
<strong>Craig 9</strong> – Professor of International Relations at the University of Southampton (Campbell, Review of International Studies, “American power preponderance and the nuclear revolution,” 35, 27–44, Cambridge Database)<br />
<br />
As Keir Lieber and Daryl Press have suggested, the US may be on the verge of acquiring a first-strike nuclear capability, which, combined with an effective system of anti-ballistic missile defence, could allow the US to destroy a rival’s nuclear capabilities and intercept any remaining retaliatory missiles before they hit American cities. While this possibility clearly reduces the likelihood of other states seeking to match American power with the aim of fighting and winning a nuclear war, and, if their argument becomes widely accepted, could lead American policy-makers to reject the logic of the nuclear revolution and consider pre-emptive nuclear strikes against large nuclear rivals, it clearly is less germane to the question of small-state deterrence.33 Lieber and Press contend that the US may have the capability to destroy the entire nuclear arsenal of another large nuclear state lest that state use it on America first for the purposes of winning a great war. That, as they say, would mean the end of Mutual Assured Destruction as it existed during the Cold War. However, Washington would have much less reason to use its new first-strike capability against a nation that cannot threaten to destroy the US, and has no ambition to defeat America in a war, but only possesses a second-strike minimum deterrent. Such an attack would turn much of the world against a US willing to use nuclear weapons and kill hundreds of thousands or millions in order to defeat a nation that did not threaten its survival. Perhaps more to the point, an attack like this would be tremendously risky. Even after a perfect first strike some retaliation might get through, which could mean the nuclear destruction of an American city or perhaps the city of an American ally. At the very least, survivors of the attacked state and their allies would seek to unleash destruction upon the US in other ways, including an unconventional delivery of a nuclear, chemical, or biological weapon. An imperfect first strike, or, even worse, a failure of the US anti-missile system, would constitute a total disaster for the US: not only would it incur the world’s wrath and suffer the destruction of one or more of its cities, but such a failure would also expose America as both a brutal and vulnerable state, surely encouraging other states to acquire nuclear weapons or otherwise defy it. The US might have reason to launch a first strike against a large rival that deployed a major arsenal and appeared ready to attack America, as implausible as this scenario is. It would have little reason to do so against a small nation with a second-strike minimum deterrent arsenal. The nuclear revolution delivers a clear message to any large state considering major war with a powerful nuclear rival. The message is that such a war is likely to escalate to total nuclear exchange, and that in this event a large percentage of its citizenry will be killed or injured, its ability to govern what remains of the nation will be weakened or destroyed, and its power relative to other states that stayed out of the war will be radically diminished. It also delivers a message to any advanced small state eager to obtain security from the possible predation of large ones. The message is that if the small state possesses, or can quickly get its hands on, a few invulnerable and deliverable nuclear weapons, any large state contemplating invading it will have to weigh the benefits of invasion against a new kind of cost – not just a difficult or stalemated conventional war, such as the US faced in Vietnam and faces in Iraq, but the destruction of perhaps one, three, or five of its cities, and the death and injury of millions of its citizens. Unless it is able to obtain an absolutely fool-proof defence against any kind of nuclear retaliation, the choice that any large state is going to make when faced with this new circumstance is so likely to be peace that the small nuclear state can feel confident that it will be safe from conquest.34 <strong>The</strong> general relevance of these <strong>messages to</strong> American <strong>unipolar preponderance is clear</strong>. At the ‘great power’ level, rising states are unlikely to regard major war as a suitable means for overturning the international system and overthrowing American preponderance. The classic means of systemic change – hegemonic war – will not be an attractive option to any state hoping to survive, and the very existence of nuclear arsenals will make all states cautious about provoking conflict with nuclear rivals, especially the heavily armed US.35 Moreover, advanced smaller states know that they can provide for their own security, if they come to believe that it is endangered, not by embarking on large military build-ups or forming alliances with larger states, but by developing a small and invulnerable nuclear arsenal, or at least preparing the way to obtain such an arsenal quickly. This means that small states have a far greater ability to defend themselves from, and therefore be less afraid of, American predation today than comparable states facing dominant powers in previous eras.36 The main effects of the nuclear revolution, then, bolster the general claim of Power Preponderance that unipolarity is enduring. To support their claim, Brooks and Wohlforth specify three factors that dissuade would-be rivals to the US from balancing against it in traditional military terms: the effect of America’s relative geographical isolation from these potential rivals; the fact that American preponderance happened as a fait accompli about which no other nation could do anything; and the vast and growing ‘power gap’ between the US and all other rivals. The next section will describe each factor, and show how the nuclear revolution specifically reinforces each of them.<br />

<strong>Aging crisis solves</strong><br />
<strong>Haas 7</strong> Assistant Professor of Political Science at Duquesne University (Mark L. “A Geriatric Peace? The Future of U.S. Power in a World of Aging Populations” <em>International Security</em>, Vol. 32, No. 1, Summer, p 112-147 (EBSCO))<br />
<br />
<strong>Global population aging will</strong> influence U.S. foreign policies in five major ways in coming decades. First, this phenomenon will <strong>be a potent force for the continuation of U.S. power dominance, both economic and military</strong>. Aging populations are likely to result in the slowdown of states’ economic growth at the same time that governments face substantial pressure to pay for massive new expenditures for elderly care. This double economic dilemma will create such an austere fiscal environment that the other great powers will lack the resources necessary to overtake the United States’ huge power lead. Investments designed to improve overall economic growth and purchases of military weaponry will be crowded out. Compounding these difficulties, although the United States is growing older, it is doing so to a lesser extent and less quickly than all the other great powers. Consequently, the economic and fiscal costs for the United States created by social aging (although staggering, especially for health care) will be significantly lower for it than for potential competitors. <strong>Global aging is therefore not only likely to extend U.S. hegemony</strong> (because the other major powers will lack the resources necessary to overtake the United States’ economic and military power lead), <strong>but deepen it as these others states are likely to fall even farther behind the United States</strong>. Thus despite much recent discussion in the international relations literature and some policymaking circles about the likelihood of China (and to a lesser extent the European Union) balancing U.S. power in coming decades, the realities of social aging and its economic and military effects make such an outcome unlikely.6<br />

Only a few years ago, pundits were absorbed in debates about American &quot;empire.&quot; Now, the conventional wisdom is that the world is rapidly approaching the end of the unipolar system with the United States as the sole superpower. A dispassionate look at the facts shows that this view understates U.S. power as much as recent talk of empire exaggerated it. That the United States weighs more on the traditional scales of world power <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">than </span></span>has any other state in modern history is as true now as it was when the commentator Charles Krauthammer proclaimed the advent of a &quot;unipolar moment&quot; in these pages nearly two decades ago. The United States continues to account for about half the world's defense spending and one-quarter of its economic output. Some of the reasons for bearishness concern public policy problems that can be fixed (expensive health care in the United States, for example), whereas many of the reasons for bullishness are more fundamental (such as the greater demographic challenges faced by the United States' potential rivals). So why has opinion shifted so quickly from visions of empire to gloomy declinism? One reason is that the United States' successes at the turn of the century <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">led </span></span>to irrational exuberance, thereby setting unreasonably high standards for measuring the superpower's performance. From 1999 to 2003, seemingly easy U.S. victories in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq led some to conclude that the United States could do what no great power in history had managed before: effortlessly defeat its adversaries. It was only a matter of time before such pie-in-the-sky benchmarks proved unattainable. Subsequent difficulties in Afghanistan and Iraq dashed illusions of omnipotence, but these upsets hardly displaced the United States as the world's leading state, and there is no reason to believe that the militaries of its putative rivals would have performed any better. The United States did not cease to be a superpower when its policies in Cuba and Vietnam failed in the 1960s; bipolarity lived on for three decades. Likewise, the United States remains the sole superpower today. Another key reason for the multipolar mania is &quot;the rise of the rest.&quot; Impressed by the rapid economic growth of China and India, many write as if multipolarity has already returned. But such pronouncements mistake current trajectories for final outcomes - a common strategic error with deep psychological roots. The greatest concern in the Cold War, for example, came not from the Soviet Union's actually parity with the United States but from expectation that it would do so in the Veterans of that era recall how the of Sputnik in 1957 fed the perception Soviet power was growing rapidly, leading some policymakers and analysts to start acting as if the Soviet Union were already as powerful as the United atares. A state is rising should not be confused with one that has risen, just as a state that is declining should not be written offas having already declined. China is generally seen as the country best positioned to emerge as a superpower challenger to the United States. Yet depending on how one measures gdp, China's economy is between 20 percent and 43 percent the size of the United States'. More dramatic is the difference in gdp per capita, for which all measures show China's as being less than 10 percent of the United States'. Absent a i930s-style depression that spares potential U.S. rivals, the United States will not be replaced as the sole superpower for a very long time. Real multipolarity - an international system of three or more evenly matched powers - is nowhere on the horizon. Relative power between states shifts slowly. This tendency to conflate trends with outcomes is often driven by the examination in isolation of certain components of state power. If the habit during the Cold War was to focus on military power, the recent trend has been to single out economic output. No declinisi tract is complete without a passage noting that although the United States may remain a military superpower, economic multipolarity is, or soon will be, the order of the day. Much as highlighting the Soviet Union's military power meant overlooking the country's economic and technological feet of clay, examining only economic output means putting on blinders. In 1991, Japan's economy was two-thirds the size of the United States', which, according to the current popular metric, would mean that with the Soviet Union's demise, the world shifted from bipolarity to, well, bipolarity. Such a partial assessment of power will produce no more accurate an analysis today. Nor will giving in to apprehension about the growing importance of nonstate actors. The National Intelligence Council's report Global Trends 2025 grabbed headlines by forecasting the coming multipolarity, anticipating a power shift as much to nonstate actors as to fast-growing countries. But nonstate actors are nothing new - compare the scale and scope of today's pirates off the Somali coast with those of their eighteenth-century predecessors or the political power of today's multinational corporations with that of such behemoths as the British East India Company - and projections of their rise may well be as much hype as reflections of reality. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">And even if the power of nonstate actors is rising, </span></span>this should only increase the incentives for interstate cooperation; <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">nonstate threats do not affect just the U</span></span>nited<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> S</span></span>tates. Most nonstate actors' behavior, moreover, still revolves around influencing the decisions of states. Nongovernmental organizations typically focus on trying to get states to change their policies, and the same is true of most terrorists. When it comes to making, managing, and remaking international institutions, states remain the most important actors - and the United States is the most important of them. No other country will match the United States' combination of wealth, size, technological capacity, and productivity in the foreseeable future. The world is and will long remain a 1 + ? world, with one superpower and ? number of major powers. A shift from 1 + 3 to 1 + 4 or 5 or 6 would have many important consequences, but it would not change the fact that the United States will long be in a far stronger position to lead the world than any other state.<br />

Asia's Big Three -- China, India and Japan -- are in rough balance. Any two of them are economically and militarily strong enough to prevent the third from dominating the region. India and Japan could balance China. China and Japan could balance India. And Japan's dreams of dominating the Pacific died in 1945. With the U.S. also prepared to defend the balance of power in Asia, it seems unlikely that China, or any other nation, will waste time and money in the effort to overturn it. China will continue to modernize its military and test the limits of its power. But for it to build armed forces that could overcome the combined might of the U.S., India and Japan is not now, and probably never will be, a feasible project.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> Another argument for high military spending is that U.S. military hegemony underlies global stability. Our forces and alliance commitments dampen conflict between potential rivals like China and Japan, we are told, preventing them from fighting wars that would disrupt trade and cost us more than the military spending that would have prevented war. The theoretical and empirical foundation for this claim is weak. It overestimates both the American military's contribution to international stability and the danger that instability abroad poses to Americans. In Western Europe, U.S. forces now contribute little to peace, at best making the tiny odds of war among states there slightly more so.7 Even in Asia, where there is more tension, the history of international relations suggests that without U.S. military deployments potential rivals, especially those separated by sea like Japan and China, will generally achieve a stable balance of power rather than fight. In other cases, as with our bases in Saudi Arabia between the Iraq wars, U.S. forces probably create more unrestthan they prevent. Our force deployments can also generate instability by prompting states to develop nuclear weapons. Even when wars occur, their economic impact is likely to be limited here.8 By linking markets, globalization provides supply alternatives for the goods we consume, including oil. If political upheaval disrupts supply in one location, suppliers elsewhere will take our orders. Prices may increase, but markets adjust. That makes American consumers less dependent on any particular supply source, undermining the claim that we need to use force to prevent unrest in supplier nations or secure trade routes.9 Part of the confusion about the value of hegemony comes from misunderstanding the Cold War. People tend to assume, falsely, that our activist foreign policy, with troops forward supporting allies, not only caused the Soviet Union's collapse but is obviously a good thing even without such a rival. Forgotten is the sensible notion that alliances are a necessary evil occasionally tolerated to balance a particularly threatening enemy. The main justification for creating our Cold War alliances was the fear that Communist nations could conquer or capture by insurrection the industrial centers in Western Europe and Japan and then harness enough of that wealth to threaten us — either directly or by forcing us to become a garrison state at ruinous cost. We kept troops in South Korea after 1953 for fear that the North would otherwise overrun it. But these alliances outlasted the conditions that caused them. During the Cold War, Japan, Western Europe and South Korea grew wealthy enough to defend themselves. We should let them. These alliances heighten our force requirements and threaten to drag us into wars, while providing no obvious benefit. </span></span><br />

<br />
The United States has the world's largest economy (so far), and the world's most powerful conventional military forces. It spends about as much on national security than the rest of the world combined, and nearly nine times more than the No. 2 power (China). It has several thousand operational nuclear weapons, each substantially more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. America is further protected from conventional military attack by two enormous oceanic moats, there no great powers in the Western hemisphere, and it hasn’t been invaded since the War of 1812. (A few southerners may want to challenge that last statement, but I'm not going to get into that). 9/11 reminded us American security is not absolute, of course, and the strategic advantages I just outlined are no defense against climate change, pandemic disease, or financial collapse. But surely the United States is about as secure as any great power in modern history. Yet Americans continue to fret about national security, continue to spend far more on national security than any other country does, and continue to believe that our way of life will be imperiled if we do not confront an array of much weaker foes on virtually every continent. One reason Americans exaggerate security fears is the existence of an extensive cottage industry of professional threatmongers, who deploy a well-honed array of arguments to convince us that we are in fact in grave danger. (The United States is hardly the only country that does this, of course, but the phenomenon is more evident here because its overall strategic position is so favorable). Debunking these claims is easier once you know the basics, so I hereby offer as a public service: The Threatmonger's Handbook: (Or, How to Scare Your Fellow Citizens for Fun and Profit.) Rule #1: Emphasize that small decisions can mark the difference between victory or defeat. The core logic of threatmongering depends on convincing others that world is highly elastic; that very small policy changes will have dramatic effects on one’s overall position. Threatmongers argue that cancelling some weapons system or failing to take action against some minor danger may leave you vulnerable to a devastating attack. At the same time, spending just a bit more or taking aggressive action now will cause potential threats to dissipate and guarantee security for years to come. Rule #2: &quot;Everything is connected.&quot; This principle is a corollary to Rule #1: a good threatmonger wants to convince you that events in one area will have far-reaching effects everywhere else. They portray a world where credibility is fragile, where dominos fall easily and where one's allies will be quick to jump on the enemy's bandwagon after a single setback. By the same logic, threatmongers promise that success in one place will quickly lead to further triumphs elsewhere. During the Vietnam War, threatmongers predicted that defeat there would lead to dominos falling all across Southeast Asia and undermine U.S. alliances all over the world (which of course didn't happen). More recently, the architects of the Iraq war argued that toppling Saddam would trigger a wave of democratic transformations across the Middle East and put dictators on notice elsewhere. In a world where everything is connected to everything else, there are no minor problems and nothing can be safely ignored. Rule #3: Emphasize threats that are inherently impossible to measure. This principle was the essence of McCarthyism: his claim that communists were infiltrating the U.S. government was impossible to disprove with 100 percent confidence, and it made many Americans fear that a vast network of subversives were secretly at work across the entire country. The problem is that there's no way to know for certain if his accusations were true or not: that flag-waving Boy Scout next door might have been an especially cunning Marxist-Leninist with a truly effective disguise. Today, threatmongers try to scare us by portraying all Muslims as potential subversives, and by suggesting that Western civilization itself is under siege from immigration, the internet, cyberterrorism, or some other covert form of infiltration. And don't forget Rule 3A: when an alleged threat is easy to measure and not really that serious, just classify the information so that nobody finds out. Rule #4: Portray allies as a liability rather than as an asset. States normally seek allies in order to pool their assets and make both more secure. Threatmongers see this differently: the more allies you have, the more interests that must be protected and the greater your security requirements actually become. Logically, U.S. defense requirements should be lower because we are allied to some of the world's wealthiest and well-armed states. But the logic of threatmongering suggests the opposite conclusion: as the United States recruits an ever-increasing network of allies, it has to defend more and more places and must therefore worry about an ever-widening array of problems. Rule #5: Whenever possible, depict opponents as part of a strong and highly cohesive movement, and preferably one united by strong ideological convictions. This is the flip side of Rule #4: our allies are weak and feckless, but our opponents are always strong, cunning, resolute, and well-organized. During the Cold War, the enemy was &quot;monolithic communism,&quot; an image that downplayed the deep schisms within the communist world. Under Bill Clinton, the danger was a motley collection of &quot;rogue states&quot; whose combined capabilities were a tiny fraction of our own and who weren't even in cahoots with one another. George W. Bush went one step further, and placed Saddam Hussein's Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and North Korea in a mythical &quot;axis of evil.&quot; Today, other threatmongers rail about the looming danger of &quot;Islamofascism,&quot; thereby suggesting that all Islamic groups are part of some vast and well-organized conspiracy. In all these cases, the same basic principle is used to make dangers look bigger than they really are. Rule #6: &quot;We must act now!&quot; To a skilled threatmonger, trends are always against us and time is always short. If we do not act soon, we are told, the window of opportunity will close and our security will be compromised forever. This is the mindset that drove Germany's decision to provoke World War I and led the Bush administration to attack Iran in 2003, and those now favor military action against Iran invoke essentially the same logic. They've forgotten Bismarck's warning: preventive war &quot;is committing suicide for fear of death.&quot; Rule #7: Always describe opponents as irrational, unalterably aggressive, and impossible to deter. If the enemy is aggressive, irrational, and willing to run great risks, then it will take overwhelming superiority to deter them and even that may not be enough. In fact, if the adversary is as nasty as the threatmongers say, then deterrence or containment probably won't work and war is probably inevitable. And if war is going to occur sooner or later, we should look for a favorable opportunity to take them out first. Kenneth Pollock of the Brookings Institution used Rule #7 to perfection in his 2002 book The Threatening Storm, thereby helping convince potentially skeptical liberals that invading Iraq was a good idea. Rule #8: When it comes to national security, there is no such thing as opportunity costs. The goal of threatmongering is to convince a country to spend more money on defense or to undertake more aggressive actions in the name of national security. Leaders or citizens may object if they think such a policy might entail real costs or require genuine tradeoffs, so skilled threatmongers often argue that increased military spending will be cost-free (for example, by claiming it will stimulate the economy and create jobs), or by suggesting that military action in one arena will produce lots of positive externalities elsewhere (see Rule #2). At the same time, they will downplay the possibility that military action lead to a costly quagmire or make it impossible to take action elsewhere (see under: Iraq). Rule #9: Assume that opponents are able to do anything they say they want to do. One easy way to scare people is to look at your enemies' wildest dreams and assume that they have the capacity to actually bring them about. During the Cold War, threatmongers studied Soviet military writings and argued that the most fantastic Soviet battle plans were an accurate measure of what the Red Army could actually accomplish, even though there were sound military reasons to reject that assessment. Or they took the rabble-rousing rhetoric of revolutionary leaders at face value and assumed that it would be as easy to spread revolution as these radicals thought. Today, threatmongers tell us that Osama bin Laden wants to topple governments throughout the Islamic world and eventually restore the medieval caliphate, even though he is as likely to achieve that goal as I am to win the Wimbledon singles title or make the finals on American Idol. It obviously makes sense to know what an adversary’s objective might be, but only a dedicated threatmonger equates desires with actual capabilities.<br />

<br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> And just like the situation at the beginning of the last century, deterrence is not working. Much is made, for example, of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) invoking Article V — the famous &quot;three musketeers&quot; pledge that an attack on one member is to be considered as an attack on all — following the terrorist attacks of September 11. But the United States is the most powerful member of NATO by far. Indeed, in 2001, it was widely considered to be a hegemon, a hyperpower. Other countries wanted to be in NATO because they felt an American guarantee would provide security. And yet it was the US that was attacked. This failure of deterrence has not received the attention it deserves. It is, after all, not unique. The North Vietnamese were not deterred by the American guarantee to South Vietnam. Similarly, Hezbollah was not deterred in Lebanon in the 1980s, and American forces were assaulted in Somalia. What has been going wrong? The successful deterrence of the superpowers during the cold war led to the belief that if such powerful countries could be deterred, then lesser powers should fall into line when confronted with an overwhelmingly powerful adversary. It is plausible, but it may be too rational. For all their ideological differences, the US and the Soviet Union observed red lines during the cold war. There were crises — Berlin, Cuba, to name a couple — but these did not touch on emotional issues or vital interests, so that compromise and retreat were possible. Indeed, what we may have missed in the west is the importance of retreat in Soviet ideology. &quot;Victory is impossible unless [the revolutionary parties] have learned both how to attack and how to retreat properly,&quot; Lenin wrote in Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder. When the Soviets retreated, the US took the credit. Deterrence worked. But what if retreat was part of the plan all along? What if, in other words, the Soviet Union was the exception rather than the rule? That question is more urgent because, in the post-cold war world, the US has expanded its security guarantees, even as its enemies show they are not impressed. The Iraqi insurgents were not intimidated by President Bush's challenge to &quot;bring 'em on&quot;. The Taliban have made an extraordinary comeback from oblivion and show no respect for American power. North Korea is demonstrating increasing belligerence. And yet the US keeps emphasising security through alliances. &quot;We believe that there are certain commitments, as we saw in a bipartisan basis to NATO, that need to be embedded in the DNA of American foreign policy,&quot; secretary of state Hillary Clinton affirmed in introducing the new National Security Strategy. But that was the reason the US was in Vietnam. It had a bipartisan commitment to South Vietnam under the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation, reaffirmed through the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which passed Congress with only two dissenting votes. It didn't work, and found its commitments were not embedded in its DNA. Americans turned against the war, Secretary Clinton among them. The great powers could not guarantee peace in Europe a century ago, and the US could not guarantee it in Asia a half-century ago. </span></span><br />

In today's world, disengagement will not cause great power war, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">and </span></span>continued <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">engagement will not</span></span> reliably <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">prevent it</span></span>. In some circumstances, engagement may actually increase the likelihood of conflict. Second, selective engagers overstate the costs of distant wars and seriously understate the costs and risks of their strategies. Overseas deployments require a large force structure. Even worse, selective engagement will ensure that when a future great power war erupts, the United States will be in the thick of things. Although distant great power wars are bad for America, the only sure path to ruin is to step in the middle of a faraway fight. Selective engagers overstate America's effect on the likelihood of future great power wars. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">There is little reason to believe that withdrawal</span></span> from Europe or Asia <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">would lead to deterrence failures</span></span>. With or without a forward U.S. presence, America's major allies have sufficient military strength to deter any potential aggressors. Conflict is far more likely to erupt from a sequence described in the spiral model. The danger of spirals leading to war in East Asia is remote. Spirals happen when states, seeking security, frighten their neighbors. The risk of spirals is great when offense is easier than defense, because any country's attempt to achieve security will give it an offensive capability against its neighbors. The neighbors' attempts to eliminate the vulnerability give them fleeting offensive capabilities and tempt them to launch preventive war. 71 But <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Asia</span></span>, as discussed earlier, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is blessed with</span></span> inherent <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">defensive advantages</span></span>. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Japan and Taiwan are islands</span></span>, which makes them very difficult to invade.<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">China has a long </span></span>land <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">border</span></span> with <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Russia</span></span>, but <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">enjoys the </span></span>protection of the <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">East China Sea</span></span>, which stands between it and Japan. The expanse of Siberia gives Russia, its ever-trusted ally, strategic depth. South Korea benefits from mountainous terrain which would channel an attacking force from the north. Offense is difficult in East Asia, so spirals should not be acute. In fact, no other region in which great powers interact offers more defensive advantage than East Asia. The prospect for spirals is greater in Europe, but continued U.S. engagement does not reduce that danger; rather, it exacerbates the risk. A West European military union, controlling more than 21 percent of the world's GDP, may worry Russia. But NATO, with 44 percent of the world's GDP, is far more threatening, especially if it expands eastward. The more NATO frightens Russia, the more likely it is that Russia will turn dangerously nationalist, redirect its economy toward the military, and try to re-absorb its old buffer states.72 But if the U.S. military were to withdraw from Europe, even Germany, Europe's strongest advocate for NATO expansion, might become less enthusiastic, because it would be German rather than American troops standing guard on the new borders. Some advocates of selective engagement point to the past fifty years as evidence that America's forward military presence reduces the chance of war. The Cold War's great power peace, however, was overdetermined. Nuclear weapons brought a powerful restraining influence.73 Furthermore, throughout the Cold War, European and Asian powers had a common foe which encouraged them to cooperate. After an American withdrawal, the Japanese, Koreans, and Russians would still have to worry about China; the Europeans would still need to keep an eye on Russia. These threats can be managed without U.S. assistance, and the challenge will encourage European and Asian regional cooperation.<br />

<strong>Cascio</strong> <strong>7</strong>—degrees in history and pol sci (Jamais, 5/2, Lost Hegemon (pt 2): The End of Conventional War,<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.openthefuture.com/2007/05/the_lost_hegemon_pt_2_the_end.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.openthefuture.com/2007/05/the_lost_hegemon_pt_2_the_end.html</a></span>, AG)<br />

Few would dispute that the American military is, far and away, the most powerful conventional armed force on the planet, even as depleted as it is by the Iraq war. At the same time, few would dispute that this military force is, and by all signs will continue to be, insufficient to quell the insurgency in Iraq. While this particular result has dramatic implications for the global position of the US, as well as for the political and economic future of the region (and the world), the larger meaning of this conflict is only beginning to become clear: conventional militaries, as a means of compelling a desired behavior on the part of a national populace, have become obsolete. The question now is how long it will take political leaders to recognize this fact, and adapt to it. The reasons for this obsolescence are clear: conventional military forces appear to be unable to defeat a networked insurgency, which combines the information age's distributed communication and rapid learning with the traditional guerilla's invisibility (by being indistinguishable from the populace) and low support needs. It's not just the American experience in Iraq (and, not as widely discussed, Afghanistan) that tells us this; Israel's latest war in Lebanon leads us to the same conclusion, and even the Soviet Union's experience in Afghanistan and America's war in Vietnam underline this same point. Insurgencies have always been hard to defeat with conventional forces, but the &quot;open source warfare&quot; model, where tactics can be learned, tested and communicated both formally and informally across a distributed network of guerillas, poses an effectively impossible challenge for conventional militaries.<br />

The fundamental problem with all these scenarios, both historical and hypothetical, is that distant peer competitors have never been able to do the one thing they would need to do to challenge the United States in its own neighborhood: move freely across the sea. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the United States has been able to generate more than enough naval (and strategic air) power to stop dead in the water any distant rival that might attempt to take on the United States over here. And, if anything, since 1945 nuclear weapons have made America's regional primacy all but unassailable.83 Rather than detracting from U.S. security, nuclear weapons enhanced it significantly. These <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">overblown notions</span> of American vulnerability to a Eurasian hegemon reflect an underlying worldview shared by U.S. policy-makers and popularized by Wilson and FDR: that in the modern world, the United States lives perpetually under the shadow of war. This grand strategic narrative rests on two key assumptions. First, because of advances in modern military technology, others can acquire the means to inflict grave damage on the United States. Second, the world is shrinking. As a result, the argument goes, the United States itself is at risk and must involve itself in the security affairs of distant regions to ward off threats to the American homeland. These arguments have a very familiar ring, because they have been invoked by the Bush II administration to justify expanding the war on terror and the invasion of Iraq. Although a straight line connects the administration's grand strategic narrative with those of Wilson and FDR, the conception of American security embodied in these narratives always has been based on a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">deeply flawed premise</span>. For, far from shrinking the world grand strategically, for the United States, modern weaponry naval and strategic airpower, intercontinental delivery systems, and nuclear weapons has widened it. Proponents of offshore balancing are sensitive to the fact that the threat <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">posed </span></span>by potential Eurasian hegemons has often been <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">exaggerated deliberately</span> and used as a pretext for intervening in conflicts where America's security clearly has not been at risk. When policymakers use arguments about technology and a shrinking world to warn of American vulnerability, they are, as Michael S. Sherry notes, doing a lot more than simply depicting reality. They are trying to shape public perceptions and to create a new reality, which is why this narrative of U.S. national security is &quot;an ideological construction, not merely a perceptual reaction.&quot;84 To be blunt, U.S. officials often have invoked the specter of a Eurasian hegemon to rationalize the pursuit of America's own hegemonic, Open Door-driven ambitions. Although it is always possible that the threat of a Eurasian hegemon justifiably might compel U.S. intervention, whenever this argument is made to justify a specific intervention, red lights should flash and it should be scrutinized very carefully, because U.S. officials have cried wolf way too many times in the past.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> There is a new enemy stalking the United States. No one can say what it is. Some call it uncertainty. We call it You Never Know. We know You Never Know is dangerous, but it is hard to say how dangerous. That is the problem. You never know. You Never Know is a powerful enemy. It cannot be defeated. Think you have a handle on uncertainty? Are you sure? You never know. Planning against You Never Know is difficult. What weapons do you buy to fight it? What organizations do you fund? What plans do you make? The answer tends to be whatever you already have. That is the catch. You Never Know is phony. It is an antidote for another threat: the threat of no threats. The threat of no threats is not a threat to most of us, who are glad to go unthreatened. But no threats is a threat to those who work to protect us from threats, the military services, defense contractors, defense think tanks, Congress, foreign policy pundits, even security studies programs. Without plausible threats to worry us, they champion merely possible ones by saying, essentially, “You never know.” The real threat is You Never Knowism — the argument that we have to invest heavily to protect ourselves against You Never Know — and the culture of threat this reasoning defends; the celebration of dangers; the concept that the only thing to fear is uncertainty and the unknown, rather than fear itself. You Never Know arguments justify excessive domestic policing, waste, and empire. While it is prudent to prepare for dangers, it is also prudent to recognize the cost of excessive prudence. By focusing on possibility, by taking a precautionary approach to national security, we frighten ourselves and strip resources from more probable threats. You Never Knowism is a large threat because You Never Know has such important friends. Those who need the threat of You Never Know guide public opinion about danger. So we all learn to fear You Never Know. But no one worries us about You Never Knowism. That is the goal of this essay — to sound the alarm against You Never Knowism. It seems futile, but it could work. You never know. The Nature of You Never Knowism The dirty secret of American national security politics is that we are safe. Americans might be the most secure people in history. But we worry. We are told that our enemies may be organizing our destruction in pockets of disorder, which are growing. We are taught that the world is chaotic, awash in civil war and terrorism, which could strike us “any place, any place with virtually any weapon.”1 We hear that our satellites are ripe for attack, that pirates prey on our shipping, that Iran’s nuclear weapons portend disaster, and that China is a growing threat. At base, however, most arguments claiming America’s insecurity rely on <strong>implausible scenarios</strong>.2 The futures these arguments fear are not probable but possible. It is possibility that justifies the defenses they advocate. Because you cannot know for certain the odds of this possible danger, this logic says, you must prepare for it. History teaches nations extreme caution. In other words, you never know. You never know what the Chinese will do if their navy and nuclear arsenal get too big. Although it seems unlikely that Kim Jong Il would fire a missile at the United States — never mind its range — and invite the destruction of his vicious little kingdom, you never know. Terrorists probably will not attack Warren, Vermont, or Cambridge, for that matter, but they might; you never know. So prepare. You Never Knowism is the guiding ethos of U.S. national security. National security planning documents are rife with it. They evoke a world of swirling uncertainty and rising complexity, a time of unprecedented change, where predictions are impossible but dangers great. They claim that the simple Soviet threat has been replaced by more various and irrational ones, which require capabilities-based planning — building military forces with no particular foe in mind. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the defense planning document drafted every four years to guide U.S. defense spending, is only the latest example. Following the National Security Strategy (2002), the National Military Strategy (2004), and the National Defense Strategy (2005), the Review, released in February, states that the United States now faces a hostile mix of terrorists, failed states that we must order, insurgencies, rogue states with missiles, and large militaries like China’s.3 Like these prior strategy documents, the QDR does not bother to estimate how probable these threats are and decide to focus on one or another on that basis. It contends simply that “managing risks” compels us to prepare for all of them. It then recommends that we retain the weapons and forces we have, with a few tweaks. The Review adopts the President’s preventive war doctrine, first articulated in the National Security Strategy, but applies the doctrine more generally, arguing that preventive action is now the cornerstone of U.S. national security strategy; that we must act to head off risks before they materialize, through attack, military-to-military support, or stabilization missions.4 You Never Knowism earns its name from its insistence on planning around what we do not know rather than what we do. It is analysis that makes its failure to figure anything out its main tenet. You Never Knowism claims you can prepare for uncertainty itself. It also <strong>refuses to justify plans based on probability</strong> and embraces possibility as the tool of argument. The essential element of You Never Knowism is its assumption that it is prudent to act at considerable cost to head off unlikely contingencies. You Never Knowism is wrong, dishonest, and dangerous. It is wrong because it overestimates today’s uncertainty and danger. It is dishonest because it is post-facto justification for a political outcome. It is dangerous because it ignores the large risks of chasing small dangers. Certainty and Safety The Cold War was also full of uncertainty. There was plenty we did not know about Soviet intentions. We did not know how to deploy defense dollars to plan against the threat. We did not agree what weapons to buy or what plans to make. We did not know which insurgencies to fight or how to successfully predict the future. After all, almost no one predicted the end of the Cold War. Instead, experts constantly predicted disaster of one kind or another. When it did end, we found that we had vastly overspent, that the Soviet Union was more a house of cards than a genuine superpower. The claim that the world is becoming more uncertain is one of those trendy notions that we are meant to accept uncritically. In fact, the world is not a roulette wheel of WMDs, insurgents, terrorists, and hostile states, but a stable place, with a few known threats. By any historical measure, Americans are particularly safe. And we live in an especially safe neighborhood. The sorts of security threats that plagued nations since their invention, indeed that necessitated their creation — invasion and civil war — are unthinkable here. Peace and order are spreading. Gross domestic products continue to rise, facilitating government authority in more corners of the earth.5 Both inter-state war and civil war are in decline.6 </span></span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> That we should care so much about weak states marks a major change. Much of 20th-century history was driven by the actions of strong states—the attempts by Germany, Japan, and, in the century's second half, the Soviet Union to establish global primacy, and the corresponding efforts of the United States and a shifting coalition of partners to resist. Those struggles produced two world wars and a Cold War. In the 21st century the principal threat to the global order will not be a push for dominance by any great power. For one thing, today's great powers are not all that great: Russia has a one-dimensional economy and is hobbled by corruption and a shrinking population; China is constrained by its enormous population and a top-heavy political system. Just as important, China and the other major or rising powers seek less to overthrow the existing global order than to shape it. They are more interested in integration than in revolution. Instead, the central challenge will be posed by weak states—Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Haiti, Mexico, Congo, and others. What they have in common (in addition to the fact that many, like Iraq, are located in the greater Middle East) are governments that lack the capacity, the will, or both to rule. They are unable to exercise what is expected of sovereign governments—namely, control over what goes on within their own territory. In the past, this would have been mostly a humanitarian concern. But as we all know, thanks to globalization, people and things travel. Terrorists, diseases, illegal migrants, weapons of mass destruction—for all of them, international boundaries are often little more than formalities. On the other hand, we cannot resolve these problems solely by using the U.S. military. As we learned in Iraq, replacing governments is easier sought than done, and in many cases there is no clear—much less preferable—alternative to the current authority. Even in a supporting role, foreign soldiers can provoke a nationalist backlash against the government they're trying to bolster, making the weak-state problem even worse. Nor is it always clear that doing more militarily will result in lasting improvements that are commensurate with the investment in blood and treasure. This could well be America's fate in Afghanistan. </span></span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> The general possibilities in relation to hegemony are continued American hegemony, hegemonic rivalry, hegemonic transition and multipolarity. The previous episode of hegemonic decline at the turn of the nineteenth century took the form of wars of hegemonic rivalry culminating in hegemonic transition. The current transition looks to be structurally different from the previous episode. Rather than hegemonic rivalry, we are witnessing global realignments toward growing multipolarity. Thus, what is at issue is not just a decline of (American) hegemony and rise of (Asian) hegemony, but a more complex field. </span></span><br />

<br />
Despite Israel’s strategically understandable claims regarding its ability to preempt Iranian nuclearization through unilateral military action, many experts foresee complications that make a singlestrike success extremely difficult if not impossible.5 Furthermore, even if Iran’s nuclear capabilities were eliminated or significantly impaired in such an attack, the military and political ramifications for Israel and its allies are likely to be <strong>much more costly</strong> than they were in 1981.6 Thus, it is necessary to consider whether the costs and opportunities associated with the emergence of a nuclear Iran might not be more tolerable than those associated with military action.<br />

<span style="mso-pagination: none;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="mso-pagination: none;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Of course, hard-line US neoconservatives reject this approach and argue that a nuclear-armed Iran would have three bad consequences: there could be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East; Iran might supply nuclear weapons to terrorists; and Tehran could use its nuclear weapons to blackmail other states in the region, or to engage in aggression. Each of these scenarios, however, is improbable.24 A nuclear Iran will not touch off a proliferation snowball in the Middle East. Israel, of course, already is a nuclear power. The other three states that might be tempted to go for a nuclear weapons capability are Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. However, each of these states would be under strong pressure not to do so, and Saudi Arabia lacks the industrial and engineering capabilities to develop nuclear weapons indigenously. Notwithstanding the Bush administration’s hyperbolic rhetoric, Iran is not going to give nuclear weapons to terrorists. This is not to deny Tehran’s close links to groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. However, there are good reasons that states – even those that have ties to terrorists – draw the line at giving them nuclear weapons (or other WMD): if the terrorists were to use these weapons against the US or its allies, the weapons could be traced back to the donor state, which would be at risk of annihilation by an American retaliatory strike.25 Iran’s leaders have too much at stake to run this risk. Even if one believes the administration’s claims that rogue state leaders are indifferent to the fate of their populations, they do <strong>care very much</strong> about the survival of their regimes, which means that they can be deterred. For the same reason, Iran’s possession of nuclear weapons will not invest Tehran with options to attack, or intimidate its neighbours. Israel’s security with respect to Iran is guaranteed by its own formidable nuclear deterrent capabilities. By the same token, just as it did in Europe during the Cold War, the US can extend its own deterrence umbrella to protect its clients in the region – Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, and Turkey. American security guarantees not only will dissuade Iran from acting recklessly, but also restrain proliferation by negating the incentives for states like Saudi Arabia and Turkey to acquire their own nuclear weapons. Given the overwhelming US advantage in both nuclear and conventional military capabilities, Iran is not going to risk national suicide by challenging America’s security commitments in the region. In short, while a nuclear-armed Iran hardly is desirable, neither is it ‘intolerable’, because it could be contained and deterred successfully by the US.  </span></span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">No chance of an Israeli strike  </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Avnery 10</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">—founder of the Gush Shalom peace movement (Uri, 'Hold Me Back!' – But Will Israel Attack Iran?, 4 April 2010, <span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://palestinechronicle.com/view_article_details.php?id=15863" rel="nofollow">http://palestinechronicle.com/view_article_details.php?id=15863</a></span>, AMiles) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">'Hold me back!' is a part of Israeli folklore. It reminds us of our childhood. When a boy has a scuffle with a bigger and stronger boy, he pretends that he is going to attack him any moment and shouts to the spectators: “Hold me back, or I am going to kill him!” Israel is now in such a situation. We pretend that we are going to attack Iran at any moment and shout to the entire world: “Hold us back or…” And the world does indeed hold us back. It is dangerous to prophesy in such matters, especially when we are dealing with people not all of whom are wise and not all of whom are sane. Yet I am ready to maintain: <strong>there is no possibility whatsoever that</strong> the government of <strong>Israel will</strong> send the air force to <strong>attack Iran</strong>. I am not going to enter into military matters. Is our air force really capable of executing such an operation? Are circumstances similar to those that prevailed 28 years ago, when the Iraqi reactor was successfully destroyed? Is it at all possible for us to eliminate the Iranian nuclear effort, whose installations are dispersed throughout the large country and buried far below the surface? I want to focus on another aspect: is it politically feasible? What would be the consequences? First of all, a basic rule of Israeli reality: the State of Israel cannot start any large-scale military operation without American consent. Israel depends on the US in almost every respect, but in no sphere is it more dependent than in the military one. The aircraft that must execute the mission were supplied to us by the US. Their efficacy depends on a steady flow of American spare parts. At that range, refueling from US-built tanker aircraft would be necessary. The same is true for almost all other war material of our army, as well as for the money needed for their acquisition. Everything comes from America. In 1956, Israel went to war without American consent. Ben-Gurion thought that his collusion with the UK and France was enough. He was vastly mistaken. One hundred hours after telling us that the “Third Kingdom of Israel” had come into being, he announced with a broken voice that he was going to evacuate all the territories just conquered. President Dwight Eisenhower, together with his Soviet colleague, had submitted an ultimatum, and that was the end of the adventure. Since then, <strong>Israel has not started a single war without securing the agreement of Washington</strong>. On the eve of the Six-day War, a special emissary was sent to the US to make sure that there was indeed American agreement. When he returned with an affirmative answer, the order for the attack was issued. On the eve of Lebanon War I, Defense Minister Ariel Sharon rushed to Washington to obtain American consent. He met with Secretary of State Alexander Haig, who agreed – but only on condition that there would be a clear provocation. A few days later there just happened to be an attempt on the life of the Israeli ambassador in London, and the war was on. The Israeli army’s offensives against Hezbollah (“Lebanon War II”) and Hamas (“Cast Lead”) were possible because they were cast as part of the American campaign against “Radical Islam”. Ostensibly, that is also true for an attack on Iran. But no. Because an Israeli attack on Iran would cause a military, political and economic disaster for the United States of America. Since the Iranians, too, realize that Israel could not attack without American consent, they would react accordingly. As I have written here before, a cursory glance at the map suffices to indicate what would be the immediate reaction. The narrow Hormuz Strait at the entrance of the Persian (or Arabian) Gulf, through which a huge part of the world’s oil flows, would be sealed at once. The results would shake the international economy, from the US and Europe to China and Japan. Prices would soar to the skies. The countries that had just begun to recover from the world economic crisis would sink to the depths of misery and unemployment, riots and bankruptcies. The Strait could be opened only by a military operation on the ground. The US simply has no troops to spare for this – even if the American public were ready for another war, one much more difficult than even those of Iraq and Afghanistan. It is even doubtful whether the US could help Israel to defend itself against the inevitable counter-stroke by Iranian missiles. The Israeli attack on a central Islamic country would unite the entire Islamic world, including the entire Arab world. The US, which has spent the last few years laboring mightily to form a coalition of “moderate” Arab states (meaning: countries governed by dictators kept by the US) against the “radical” states. This pack would immediately become unstuck. No Arab leader would be able to stand aside while the masses of his people were gathering in tumultuous demonstrations in the squares. All this is clear to any knowledgeable person, and even more so to the American military and civilian leaders. Secretaries, generals and admirals have been sent to Israel to make this clear to our leaders in a language that even kindergarten kids can understand: No! Lo! La! Nyet! If so, why has the military option not been removed from the table? Because the US and Israel like it lying there. The US likes to pose as if it can hardly hold back the ferocious Israeli Rottweiler on its leash. This puts pressure on the other powers to agree to the imposition of sanctions on Iran. If you don’t agree, the murderous dog could leap out of control. Think about the consequences!  </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> Rather than continuing to focus on the increasingly meager &quot;carrot and stick&quot; policy options for &quot;rolling back&quot; North Korea's nuclear program, attention needs to shift toward how best to manage North Korea's nuclear weapons capability as a strategic fact of life. The well-worn debate between those who advocate &quot;tough&quot; measures to force Pyongyang to disarm and those who propose &quot;incentives&quot; to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear capability ignores the compelling evidence that points to Pyongyang's determination to hold on to its emerging nuclear stockpile. Having run the gauntlet of international opprobrium, increased isolation, and the ongoing specter of U.S. preemptive military action, it is highly unlikely that Pyongyang will decide to capitulate to external pressure in the foreseeable future. While of course possible, this latter scenario is extremely remote. There can be little doubt that the North Korean regime is aware that a united international front against its nuclear program will remain a pipe dream for as long as the major powers have competing strategic and geopolitical interests in Northeast Asia. The Six-Party Talks—having achieved nothing in the way of substantive outcomes—have undoubtedly been seen in Pyongyang as a useful way to accentuate the existing divisions between the procontainment position of the United States and Japan on the one side, and the proengagement stance of China, South Korea, and Russia on the other.82 A closer assessment of the DPRK's evolving national strategy and its motives for going nuclear suggests that, rather than representing an aggressive endeavor to coerce regional neighbors, North Korea's acquisition of nuclear weapons owes more to its deep-seated strategic isolation. One theme, above all, emerges from the analysis of the preceding section of this chapter: North Korea’s national strategy and its motives for acquiring nuclear weapons are essentially defensive in nature. Regime preservation and national survival are the paramount goals of the DPRK. These objectives are status quo-oriented. They are, <strong>by definition, incompatible with the high-risk strategy of using nuclear weapons against regional neighbors</strong> and the United States. There is no evidence to conclude that North Korean elites are irrational and willing to take decisions inimical to their broader goal of regime survival. For as long as Washington continues to extend its nuclear umbrella to allies in Northeast Asia, the Pyongyang regime will appreciate that any use of nuclear weapons on its part would precipitate war with the United States and its allies and inevitably lead to its rapid demise.8* Notwithstanding the likelihood that the United States will continue gradually withdrawing major ground force elements from South Korea and Japan, Washington has made it clear that it intends to maintain the presence of its air and naval strike platforms in the Asia-Pacific, many of which are configured with nuclear-capable systems.84 While the United States no longer deploys tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea, and although the U.S. Navy has removed nuclear weapons from its surface fleet, American submarines traversing the Pacific Ocean are armed with a nuclear cruise missile capability and B-52s stationed in Guam in the Pacific remain nuclear capable.8^ These theater force elements could be supplemented by nuclear-capable systems on the continental United States, including the B-2 bomber force and America's large ICBM arsenal. Against this background, the chances of North Korea being deterred from using (or even seriously brandishing) nuclear weapons in Northeast Asia are greater than many within the policy and academic community have conceded. Despite previous statements by the Bush administration alleging that the Pyongyang regime is &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;unbalanced&quot; in its behavior, senior U.S. officials, including the Secretary of State, have signaled their belief that North Korea will remain deterred at the nuclear level for as long as the United States maintains a credible strategic presence in Northeast Asia.86 There are three additional conditions that strengthen the prospects for a stable system of nuclear deterrence between North Korea and the United States. The first, and the most noteworthy, is the existing template of conventional deterrence on the Korean peninsula. Despite ominous predictions following the Korean War armistice of 1953, there has been no armed conflict on the peninsula for more than half a century. As David Kang points out, the reason for this is disarmingly straightforward: &quot;The peninsula has been stable for fifty years because deterrence has been clear and unambiguous.&quot;8' Even during the 1960s and 1970s, a period in which many observers credited Pyongyang with having a very good chance of success in reunifying the peninsula by force, North Korea remained deterred from attacking the South. While there can be little doubt that the U.S. nuclear deterrent was a factor, it is also likely that the regime in Pyongyang judged the massive costs of any invasion (illuminated brutally between 1950-53) as nullifying any potential gains. If anything, this deterrence logic has probably been strengthened in the eyes of the DPRK leadership over the last decade or so in the context of the relative decline of North Korea's conventional force capabilities. Given that North Korea has been deterred consistently at the conventional level since 1953, there are few grounds for assuming that Pyongyang would behave any differently at the nuclear level. The point to stress is that conventional deterrence provides a fairly reliable measure of how North Korea would behave at the nuclear level. At both levels, the regime must realize that any breakdown in deterrence would in all likelihood lead to war, defeat, and, ultimately, its extinction. The second condition is that the United States itself appears to be deterred from striking nuclear targets in North Korea. This is despite the Bush administration's promulgation of the doctrine of preemption in 2002 and the belief in some quarters of the American policy community that North Korea's nuclear capability could eventually pose a tangible threat to the United States mainland if married with an operational ICBM capability. Of course, it is plausible that a future U.S. administration may well decide to reverse this position and attempt to nullify Pyongyang's nuclear capability through the use of force. But even those who see this as increasingly likely in the context of growing support within the United States for regime change in North Korea estimate that the chances of &quot;such an attack being ordered in the next few years is perhaps something between 10 percent and 30 percent.&quot;88 Washington's evident reluctance to carry out preventive strikes against nuclear targets in North Korea, despite North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT and its decision to carry out a nuclear test, stems from two reasons. The first is that military strikes, no matter how carefully tailored to reassure the regime in Pyongyang that they did not represent the first phase of a full-scale invasion, would almost certainly trigger large-scale North Korean retaliation against South Korea. In the unlikely event that the regime believed U.S. reassurances, it would probably not accept them. Faced with the prospect of its highly prized nuclear inventory being neutralized. North Korea's senior elites would seek to extract a heavy price. The DPRK's massive artillery and rocket forces within short range of Seoul would make this a relatively straightforward option. The second reason why the United States remains deterred from undertaking strike missions inside the DPRK is a realization that American air assets and special operations forces may not be able to capture or destroy North Korea's nuclear capabilities before Pyongyang has an opportunity to use them against a range of possible targets in South Korea and Japan. In these circumstances, American action would have the effect of exposing its regional allies to the very threat it had sought to negate. The third condition that bolsters the prospects for deterrence on the Korean peninsula is that regional countries have had some time to get used to the idea (if not the reality) of a nuclear-armed North Korea. For Japan and South Korea, the prospect of dealing with a nuclear DPRK may not be particularly appealing, but nor is it a bolt from the blue. States in Northeast Asia have been aware for some time that North Korea has been seeking (and gradually acquiring) nuclear weapons and have no doubt factored the scenario of a nuclear-armed DPRK into their strategic planning. A nuclear domino effect in Northeast Asia has been identified in some quarters as a corollary of Pyongyang going nuclear, but such an outcome is by no means preordained. For South Korea, a nuclear-armed DPRK does not pose a new threat as such: for decades Seoul has faced the prospect of massive destruction and loss of life on ROK territory due to North Korea's ability to unleash its prodigious conventional firepower against major South Korean cities. It is hard to see any persuasive rationale for South Korea to follow in the North's nuclear footsteps in a context where Seoul seems less concerned about confronting the DPRK militarily and more intent on preserving the status quo on the peninsula.89 In the case of Japan, which remains a threshold nuclear state, for much of the cold war successive governments in Tokyo were persuaded of the credibility of U.S. guarantees that the latter would use nuclear weapons to defend Japan's territorial sovereignty against the large-scale Soviet nuclear inventory.90 There is no obvious reason why Japan would review the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence guarantees against a comparatively small arsenal as that possessed by North Korea. In the wake of North Korea's nuclear test, senior Japanese officials publicly ruled out responding with a nuclear weapons program of their own following the reaffirmation of U.S. security guarantees.91 </span></span><br />

Upon taking office in January 2009, the <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama </span></span>administration made clear its willingness to engage directly with Pyongyang but also that it <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">wanted to push ahead with the six-party talks</span></span> intended to shutter the regime's nuclear-weapon program. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The North responded with</span></span> an apparent <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">ballistic missile test</span></span> in April and its second nuclear test in May, and was hit with stronger U.N. sanctions for its efforts. Pressure and heated rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang have eased since then, according to Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. North Korea has expressed a willingness to participate in denuclearization negotiations with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States, which were last held in December 2008 - but only after being freed from sanctions and beginning peace talks with the United States. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Experts voiced </span></span>their <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">pessimism over the chance of progress in any talks</span></span>, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">based on failures by </span></span>Washington and the other <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">governments to deter North Korea from pursuing nuclear weapons even after </span></span>giving Pyongyang <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">numerous incentives</span></span>. &quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">I don't think that this administration or any future administration can promise more</span></span>,&quot; <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Cha</span></span>, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">a former negotiator</span></span> to the talks, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">said </span></span>at the Feb. 18 event. Diplomatic efforts by prior U.S. presidential administrations differed in approach but have offered North Korea the same basic incentives going back to the administration of President George H.W. Bush, Cha said. These promises included energy and economic support, normalization of relations between the Pyongyang and Washington, supporting a civilian nuclear energy program in the North, and consideration of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War. Under the most recent agreement, in 2007, the Bush administration removed North Korea from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and joined several other six-party states in providing heavy fuel oil for isolated state. Pyongyang took steps toward disabling its plutonium-producing Yongbyon complex, but never followed through on its pledge to dismantle the site. It has since ejected international monitors and resumed operations there. In previous agreements with the North, the other states &quot;put all the hard requirements down later on in the agreement just so you can get the negotiations going,&quot; said Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. &quot;It's classic confidence building. The problem with that is every time we've done this, it's placed these sort of agreements at risk later on and they fall apart when there's anything serious about to be done.&quot; North Korea has conducted two nuclear test blasts and is believed to have sufficient plutonium for several weapons. However, its ability to actually delivery any warhead remains in doubt. The fundamental question underlining the years-long process of the six-party talks was the possibility North Korea could be persuaded to eliminate its nuclear program if given the right incentives. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Pyongyang</span></span>, though, has,&quot; and numerous U.S. pledges of its nonhostile intentions have not quelled that mistrust. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">continually cited the need for nuclear weapons in the face of &quot;external threats This standoff is evidence that <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">no U.S. assurances or incentives</span> would curb North Korean</span></span> doubts and persuade it to take meaningful steps toward <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">denuclearization</span></span>, according to Cha. &quot;It is very difficult for me to see this particular regime ever denuclearizing because even if you got rid of every potential external threat to North Korea -- even <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">if you surrounded North Korea with five Costa Ricas</span></span> --<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">this regime would still feel insecure,&quot;</span></span> he said. &quot;It's the nature of the regime; its inability to fulfill at least their version of the socialist contract with their people. This is the primary insecurity to the regime.&quot; Cronin was similarly downbeat. &quot;I hate to be an additional realist and skeptic on this,&quot; he said. &quot;Are we asking and expecting too much from six-party talks?&quot; The United States should not expect the regime's &quot;calculus&quot; to change through negotiations, he added. Instead, the Obama administration should use the talks to maintain and strengthen partnerships with allies South Korea and Japan, according to Cronin. An additional obstacle to North Korean nuclear disarmament is the program's international notoriety, according to one speaker. &quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">I </span></span>just <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">don't see that the government</span></span> in Pyongyang <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">has much </span></span>reason -- or much <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">incentive </span></span>-- <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">to give away the one thing that has caused the</span></span> rest of the <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">world to pay them any </span></span>significant <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">attention</span></span> whatsoever since the end of the Cold War,&quot; said Christopher Ford, director of the Center for Technology and Global Security at the Hudson Institute.<br />

The Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Review notes that tests of the North's Taepodong 2 ballistic missile in 2006 and 2009 failed, the Korea Herald reported. &quot;We must assume that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">sooner or later North Korea will have a successful test</span></span> of its TD-2 and, if there are no major changes in its national security strategy in the next decade, it will be able to mate a nuclear warhead to a proven delivery system,&quot; the authors stated. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Pyongyang has &quot;successfully tested many technologies associated with an ICBM despite the most recent launch's failure</span></span> in its stated mission of orbiting a small communications satellite,&quot; the review noted, referring to an April 2009 launch by the North that was widely seen as a test of long-range missile technology (Korea Herald I, Feb. 2). At a news conference yesterday in Washington, U.S. Defense Undersecretary Michele Flournoy said the United States was presently safeguarded from a ballistic missile strike from North Korea, the Yonhap News Agency reported. &quot;It's important to note that U.S. homeland missile defense efforts are focused on regional actors such as North Korea and Iran and are not intended to affect the strategic balance with Russia or China,&quot; Flournoy said. &quot;We're currently protected against a limited ballistic missile attack, and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future.&quot; However, the potential spread of North Korean nuclear technology and materials is a serious concern at the Pentagon. &quot;The instability or collapse of a WMD-armed state is among our most troubling concerns,&quot; the Pentagon's newly released Quadrennial Defense Review said in an apparent reference to the impoverished and isolated North Korean regime. &quot;Such an occurrence could lead to a rapid proliferation of WMD material, weapons and technology, and could quickly become a global crisis posing a direct physical threat to the United States and all other nations&quot; (Hwang Doo-hyong, Yonhap News Agency, Feb. 1). Meanwhile, South Korea's chief official for North Korean policy, Hyun In-taek, voiced doubts today on whether Pyongyang would ever agree to relinquish its nuclear weapons, Agence France-Presse reported. &quot;With regard to the North Korean nuclear problem we are still stuck in a deep, dark tunnel,&quot; the unification minister said in Seoul. He noted that without offering concessions of its own, the Stalinist regime was demanding that U.N. Security Council sanctions be lifted as a precondition to returning to six-nation nuclear negotiations with China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States. The disarmament talks were last held more than a year ago. &quot;It has come to the point of using its return to the six-party talks as a bargaining chip,&quot; Hyun said. &quot;If this continues, we can never be sure when the North Korean nuclear problem will be solved&quot; (Agence France-Presse/Spacewar.com, Feb. 2). Hyun was also doubtful on the prospects of a possible inter-Korean summit making any headway on the nuclear issue, the Korea Herald reported. &quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The mere mention of the North Korean nuclear issue at the summit</span></span> ... <span class="Underline"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;">would be meaningless</span></span>,&quot; he said.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> Most of the foreign policy community has still not absorbed the facts about North Korean developments over the past eight years. One of the poorest and most isolated states on earth, North Korea had at most two bombs' worth of plutonium in 2001. Today, it has an arsenal of ten bombs and has conducted two nuclear weapons tests. It is currently harvesting the plutonium for an 11th bomb and restoring its reactor in Yongbyon, which has the capacity to produce a further two bombs' worth of plutonium a year. In addition, Pyongyang has repeatedly tested long-range missiles that are increasingly reliable, has proliferated nuclear technologies (including the sale of a Yongbyon-style reactor to Syria), and may be developing a second path to nuclear weapons by building a facility to enrich uranium. </span></span><br />

<br />
As Model 1 in Table IV illustrates, all of our variables are statistically significant except for the protracted conflict variable. Our primary independent variable, the number of nuclear actors involved in the crisis, has a negative relationship with the severity of violence and is significant. This lends preliminary support to the argument that nuclear weapons have a restraining affect on crisis behavior, as stated in H1. It should be noted that, of the crises that involved four nuclear actors – Suez Nationalization War (1956), Berlin Wall (1961), October Yom Kippur War (1973), and Iraq No-Fly Zone (1992) – and five nuclear actors – Gulf War (1990) – only two are not full-scale wars. While this demonstrates that the pacifying effect of more nuclear actors is not strong enough to prevent war in all situations, it does not necessarily weaken the argument that there is actually a pacifying effect. The positive and statistically significant coefficient on the variable that counts the number of crisis actors has a magnitude greater than that on the variable that counts the number of nuclear actors. Since increases in the number of overall actors in a crisis are strongly associated with higher levels of violence, it should be no surprise that many of the conflicts with many nuclear actors – by extension, many general actors as well – experienced war. Therefore, the results can only suggest that, keeping the number of crisis actors fixed, increasing the proportion of nuclear actors has a pacifying effect. They do not suggest that adding nuclear actors to a crisis will decrease the risk of high levels violence; but rather, adding more actors of any type to a crisis can have a destabilizing effect. Also in Table IV, Model 2 demonstrates that the effect of a nuclear dyad is only approaching statistical significance, but does have a sign that indicates higher levels of violence are less likely in crises with opponents that have nuclear weapons than other crises. This lukewarm result suggests that it might not be necessary for nuclear actors to face each other in order to get the effect of decreased propensity for violence. All actors should tend to be more cautious in escalation when there is a nuclear opponent, regardless of their own capabilities. While this might weaken support for focusing on specifically a ‘balance of terror’ as a source of stability (see Gaddis, 1986; Waltz, 1990; Sagan &amp; Waltz, 2003; Mearsheimer, 1990), it supports the logic in this article that nuclear weapons can serve as a deterrent of aggression from both nuclear and non-nuclear opponents.6 Model 3 transforms the violence variable to a binary indicator of war and demonstrates that the principal relationship between the number of nuclear actors and violence holds for the most crucial outcome of full-scale war. Model 4 demonstrates that accounting for the presence of new nuclear actors does not greatly change the results. The coefficient on the new nuclear actor variable is statistically insignificant, which lends credence to the optimists’ view that new nuclear-weapon states should not be presupposed to behave less responsibly than the USA, USSR, UK, France, and China did during the Cold War. Finally, Model 5 similarly illustrates that crises involving super- powers are not more or less prone to violence than others. Superpower activity appears to not be driving the observed relationships between the number of nuclear-crisis actors and restraint toward violence. It is important to establish more specifically what the change in the probability of full-scale war is when nuclear actors are involved. Table V presents the probability of different levels of violence as the number of nuclear actors increases in the Clarify simulations. The control variables are held at their modes or means, with the exception of the variable that counts the number of crisis actors. Because it would be impossible to have, say, five nuclear-crisis actors and only two crisis actors, the number of crisis actors is held constant at five. As we can see, the impact of an increase in the number of nuclear actors is substantial. Starting from a crisis situation without any nuclear actors, including one nuclear actor (out of five) reduces the likelihood of full-scale war by nine percentage points. As we continue to add nuclear actors, the likelihood of full-scale war declines sharply, so that the probability of a war with the maximum number of nuclear actors is about three times less than the probability with no nuclear actors. In addition, the probabilities of no violence and only minor clashes increase substantially as the number of nuclear actors increases. The probability of serious clashes is relatively constant. Overall, the analysis lends significant support to the more optimistic proliferation argument related to the expectation of violent conflict when nuclear actors are involved. While the presence of nuclear powers does not prevent war, it significantly reduces the probability of full-scale war, with more reduction as the number of nuclear powers involved in the conflict increases. As mentioned, concerns about selection effects in deterrence models, as raised by Fearon (2002), should be taken seriously. While we control for the strategic selection of serious threats within crises, we are unable to control for the non-random initial initiation of a crisis in which the actors may choose to enter a crisis based on some ex ante assessment of the out-comes. To account for possible selection bias caused by the use of a truncated sample that does not include any non-crisis cases, one would need to use another dataset in which the crisis cases are a subset and then run Heckman-type selection models (see Lemke &amp; Reed, 2001). It would, however, be difficult to think of a different unit of analysis that might be employed, such that the set of crises is a subset of a larger category of interaction.<br />

<br />
A growing and compelling body of research suggests that nuclear weapons may not, in fact, make the world more dangerous, as Obama and most people assume. The bomb may actually make us safer. In this era of rogue states and transnational terrorists, that idea sounds so obviously wrongheaded that few politicians or policymakers are willing to entertain it. But that’s a mistake. Knowing the truth about nukes would have a profound impact on government policy. Obama’s idealistic campaign, so out of character for a pragmatic administration, may be unlikely to get far (past presidents have tried and failed). But it’s not even clear he should make the effort. There are more important measures the U.S. government can and should take to make the real world safer, and these mustn’t be ignored in the name of a dreamy ideal (a nukefree planet) that’s both unrealistic and possibly undesirable. The argument that nuclear weapons can be agents of peace as well as destruction rests on two deceptively simple observations. First, nuclear weapons have not been used since 1945. Second, there’s never been a nuclear, or even a nonnuclear, war between two states that possess them. Just stop for a second and think about that: it’s hard to overstate how remarkable it is, especially given the singular viciousness of the 20th century. As Kenneth Waltz, the leading “nuclear optimist” and a professor emeritus of political science at UC Berkeley puts it, “We now have 64 years of experience since Hiroshima. It’s striking and against all historical precedent that for that substantial period, there has not been any war among nuclear states.” To understand why—and why the next 64 years are likely to play out the same way—you need to start by recognizing that all states are rational on some basic level. Their leaders may be stupid, petty, venal, even evil, but they tend to do things only when they’re pretty sure they can get away with them. Take war: a country will start a fight only when it’s almost certain it can get what it wants at an acceptable price. Not even Hitler or Saddam waged wars they didn’t think they could win. The problem historically has been that leaders often make the wrong gamble and underestimate the other side—and millions of innocents pay the price. Nuclear weapons change all that by making the costs of war obvious, inevitable, and unacceptable. Suddenly, when both sides have the ability to turn the other to ashes with the push of a button— and everybody knows it—the basic math shifts. Even the craziest tin-pot dictator is forced to accept that war with a nuclear state is unwinnable and thus not worth the effort. As Waltz puts it, “Why fight if you can’t win and might lose everything?” Why indeed? The iron logic of deterrence and mutually assured destruction is so compelling, it’s led to what’s known as the nuclear peace: the virtually unprecedented stretch since the end of World War II in which all the world’s major powers have avoided coming to blows. They did fight proxy wars, ranging from Korea to Vietnam to Angola to Latin America. But these never matched the furious destruction of full-on, great-power war (World War II alone was responsible for some 50 million to 70 million deaths). And since the end of the Cold War, such bloodshed has declined precipitously. Meanwhile, the nuclear powers have scrupulously avoided direct combat, and there’s very good reason to think they always will. There have been some near misses, but a close look at these cases is fundamentally reassuring—because in each instance, very different leaders all came to the same safe conclusion. Take the mother of all nuclear standoffs: the Cuban missile crisis. For 13 days in October 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union each threatened the other with destruction. But both countries soon stepped back from the brink when they recognized that a war would have meant curtains for everyone. As important as the fact that they did is the reason why: Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev’s aide Fyodor Burlatsky said later on, “It is impossible to win a nuclear war, and both sides realized that, maybe for the first time.” The record since then shows the same pattern repeating: nucleararmed enemies slide toward war, then pull back, always for the same reasons. The best recent example is India and Pakistan, which fought three bloody wars after independence before acquiring their own nukes in 1998. Getting their hands on weapons of mass destruction didn’t do anything to lessen their animosity. But it did dramatically mellow their behavior. Since acquiring atomic weapons, the two sides have never fought another war, despite severe provocations (like Pakistani-based terrorist attacks on India in 2001 and 2008). They have skirmished once. But during that flare-up, in Kashmir in 1999, both countries were careful to keep the fighting limited and to avoid threatening the other’s vital interests. Sumit Ganguly, an Indiana University professor and coauthor of the forthcoming India, Pakistan, and the Bomb, has found that on both sides, officials’ thinking was strikingly similar to that of the Russians and Americans in 1962. The prospect of war brought Delhi and Islamabad face to face with a nuclear holocaust, and leaders in each country did what they had to do to avoid it. Nuclear pessimists—and there are many—insist that even if this pattern has held in the past, it’s crazy to rely on it in the future, for several reasons. The first is that today’s nuclear wannabes are so completely unhinged, you’d be mad to trust them with a bomb. Take the sybaritic Kim Jong Il, who’s never missed a chance to demonstrate his battiness, or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has denied the Holocaust and promised the destruction of Israel, and who, according to some respected Middle East scholars, runs a messianic martyrdom cult that would welcome nuclear obliteration. These regimes are the ultimate rogues, the thinking goes —and there’s no deterring rogues. But are Kim and Ahmadinejad really scarier and crazier than were Stalin and Mao? It might look that way from Seoul or Tel Aviv, but history says otherwise. Khrushchev, remember, threatened to “bury” the United States, and in 1957, Mao blithely declared that a nuclear war with America wouldn’t be so bad because even “if half of mankind died . . . the whole world would become socialist.” Pyongyang and Tehran support terrorism—but so did Moscow and Beijing. And as for seeming suicidal, Michael Desch of the University of Notre Dame points out that Stalin and Mao are the real recordholders here: both were responsible for the deaths of some 20 million of their own citizens. Yet when push came to shove, their regimes balked at nuclear suicide, and so would today’s international bogeymen. For all of Ahmadinejad’s antics, his power is limited, and the clerical regime has always proved rational and pragmatic when its life is on the line. Revolutionary Iran has never started a war, has done deals with both Washington and Jerusalem, and sued for peace in its war with Iraq (which Saddam started) once it realized it couldn’t win. North Korea, meanwhile, is a tiny, impoverished, family-run country with a history of being invaded; its overwhelming preoccupation is survival, and every time it becomes more belligerent it reverses itself a few months later (witness last week, when Pyongyang told Seoul and Washington it was ready to return to the bargaining table). These countries may be brutally oppressive, but nothing in their behavior suggests they have a death wish.<br />

<strong>Prolif solves conventional wars</strong><br />
<strong>Preston 9—</strong>assoc prof, IR, Wash State U (Thomas, From Lambs to Lions, 31-2, AMiles)<br />
<br />
Advocates of deterrence seldom take the position that it will always work or that it cannot fail. Rather, they take the position that if one can achieve the requisite elements required to achieve a stable deterrent relationship between parties, it vastly decreases the chances of miscalculation and resorting to war—even in contexts where it might otherwise be expected to occur (George and Smoke 1974; Harvey 1997a; Powell 1990, 2003; Goldstein 2000). Unfortunately, critics of deterrence take the understandable, if unrealistic, position that if deterrence cannot be 100 percent effective under all circumstances, then it is an unsound strategic approach for states to rely upon, especially considering the immense destructiveness of nuclear weapons. Feaver (1993,162). for example, criticizes reliance on nuclear deterrence because it can fail and that rational deterrence theory can only predict that peace should occur most of the time (e.g., Lebow and Stein 1989). Yet, were we to apply this standard of perfection to most other policy approaches concerning security matters—whether it be arms control or proliferation regime efforts, military procurement policies, alliance formation strategies, diplomacy, or sanctions—none could be argued with any more certainty to completely remove the threat of equally devastating wars either. Indeed, one could easily make the argument that these alternative means have shown themselves historically to be far less effective than nuclear arms in preventing wars. Certainly, the twentieth century was replete with examples of devastating conventional conflicts which were not deterred through non-nuclear measures. Although the potential costs of a nuclear exchange between small states would indeed cause a frightful loss of life, it would be no more costly (and likely far less so) than large-scale conventional conflicts have been for combatants. Moreover, if nuclear deterrence raises the potential costs of war high enough for policy makers to want to avoid (rather than risk) conflict, it is just as legitimate (if not more so) for optimists to argue in favor of nuclear deterrence in terms of the lives saved through the avoidance of far more likely recourses to conventional wars, as it is for pessimists to warn of the potential costs of deterrence failure. And, while some accounts describing the &quot;immense weaknesses&quot;' of deterrence theory (Lebow and Stein 1989. 1990) would lead one to believe deterrence was almost impossible to either obtain or maintain, since 1945 there has not been one single historical instance of nuclear deterrence failure {especially when this notion is limited to threats to key central state interests like survival, and not to minor probing of peripheral interests). Moreover, the actual costs of twentieth-century conventional conflicts have been staggeringly immense, especially when compared to the actual costs of nuclear conflicts (for example, 210,000 fatalities in the combined 1945 Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings compared to 62 million killed overall during World War II. over three million dead in both the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, etc.) (McKinzie et al. 2001.28).3 Further, as Gray (1999. 158-59) observes, &quot;it is improbable that policymakers anywhere need to be educated as to the extraordinary qualities and quantities of nuclear armaments.&quot; Indeed, the high costs and uncontestable, immense levels of destruction that would be caused by nuclear weapons have been shown historically to be facts that have not only been readily apparent and salient to a wide range of policy makers, but ones that have clearly been demonstrated to moderate extreme policy or risk-taking behavior (Blight 1992; Preston 2001) Could it go wrong? Of course. There is always that potential with human beings in the loop. Nevertheless, it has also been shown to be effective at moderating policy maker behavior and introducing an element of constraint into situations that otherwise would likely have resulted in war (Hagerty 1998).<br />

<strong>Curbing nuclear prolif causes a shift to bioweapons.</strong><br />
<strong>Zilinskas 2k—</strong>Former Clinical Microbiologist. Dir. – Chem/Bio Weapons Nonproliferation Program – Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Monterey Institute of International Studies (Raymond, Biological warfare: modern offense and defense, 1-2, AMiles)<br />
<br />
It is an odd characteristic of biological weapons that military generals tend to view them with distaste, but civilian bioscientists often have lobbied for their development and deployment. There are, of course, understandable reasons for this oddity; generals find that these weapons do not fit neatly into tactical or strategic military doctrines of attack or defense, whereas researchers have observed that transforming microbes into weapons presents interesting scientific challenges whose solution governments have been willing to pay well for. Another oddity is that whenever biological weapons have been employed in battle, they have proven militarily ineffectual, yet bellicose national leaders persevere in seeking to acquire them. There is also a facile explanation for this anomaly, namely, that although pathogens are all too willing to invade prospective hosts, human ingenuity so far has failed to devise reliable methods for effectively conveying a large number of pathogens to the population targeted for annihilation by disease. This repeated failure has not deterred leaders; again and again they become allured by the potential destructive power of biological weapons. Perhaps trusting science too much, they direct government scientists to develop them, believing that this time a usable weapon of mass destruction will be achieved. Their belief so far has been thwarted, but is it possible that within the foreseeable future the potential of biological weapons will be realized and that the effect of a biological bomb, missile, or aerosolized cloud can be as readily predetermined as that of a bomb or missile carrying a conventional or nuclear warhead? There are many who believe that today's bioscientists and chemical engineers working in unison and wielding the techniques of molecule biology developed since the early 1970s could, if so commanded, develop militarily effective biological weapons within a fairly short time. If this supposition is correct, our perception of biological weapons as being undependable, uncontrollable, and unreliable must change. The reason is simple: if these weapons are demonstrated to possess properties that make it possible for commanders to effect controlled, confined mass destruction on command, all governments would be forced to construct defenses against them and some undoubtedly would be tempted to arm their military with these weapons that would be both powerful and relatively inexpensive to acquire. Ironically, as tougher international controls are put into place to deter nations from seeking to acquire chemical and nuclear weapons, leaders may be even more drawn to biological arms as the most accessible form of weapon of mass destruction. Before beginning a consideration of the implications of molecular biology for biological warfare (BW) and defense, it is worthwhile to briefly review the history of microbiology. It has passed through two eras, and we presently are in its third era. The first was the “pre-Pasteur” era; when the underlying science of fermentation was unknown, so microbiology was applied strictly on an empirical basis. Although undoubtedly any fine beers and wines, as well as breads and other fermented foods, were produced through the use of empirically developed fermentation techniques, no finely controlled production of chemicals was possible. During this era, BW was also empirically based. Common tactics included contaminating water sources with bloated animal carcasses and catapulting infected cadavers into citadels (Poupard and Miller, 1992).<br />

<strong>Extinction.</strong><br />

Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. Potentially worse than that, bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation. AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE. ﻿<br />

<span style="mso-pagination: none;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The above analysis indicates that a nuclearized Iran is extremely unlikely to pose an existential threat to Israel. The doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction holds in the Iranian context: Iran’s clerical rulers, anxious to protect their own power, citizens and civilization, will not launch a war that will lead to their own destruction. Iran’s rulers are extremely unlikely to pass nuclear material on to terrorist actors whose loyalty they cannot ensure. They are also unlikely to step up conventional or terrorist harassment of Israel for fear of the escalation of hostilities to nuclear warfare. The impact of Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons upon Israel’s regional interests is less problematic than one might think. Although the regime-change option would be off the table, it is not clear that it has ever been a feasible alternative given current geopolitical realities. Any increase in domestic political support for the Iranian regime is likely to be temporary. Iran may indeed be empowered to pursue its own regional interests, but such pursuit is not necessarily bad for Israeli interests. Finally, it will be many years before Iran’s weapons stockpile begins to approach Israel’s and the latter is compelled to engage in an expensive arms race. Indeed, there is reason to believe that Iran’s access to nuclear weapons may increase the prospects for regional stability and even Middle East peace. Given the horrendous consequences of an accidental nuclear war, it will be imperative that Iran and Israel develop some sort of ability to communicate with one another directly. It is not outside the realm of possibility that the institutionalization of such communications may be the first step in the normalization of relations between the two countries and the future integration of Israel into its neighborhood. This is not to say that Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons is a good thing for Israel, the United States or the world as a whole. There are many legitimate reasons to be concerned about nuclear proliferation in any country, and the international community should do all it can to dissuade Iran and other nations from their nuclear aspirations and encourage current members of the nuclear club to reduce and even eliminate their stockpiles<strong>. The analysis presented above does suggest, however, that the acquisition of nuclear weapons by the Islamic Republic is not likely to lead to any more nuclear events than the world has witnessed since Hiroshima and Nagasaki--that is, zero.</strong> </span></span><br />

<span style="mso-pagination: none;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="mso-pagination: none;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Finally, even if the acquisition of nuclear weapons does enhance Iran’s ability to pursue its regional interests, there is no reason to assume that Israeli interests will automatically be trampled as a result. There are significant areas of overlapping and complementary interests between the two countries. Both will benefit, for example, from increased stability in Iraq, the containment of fundamentalist strands of Islam, and – most important – the moderation of conflicts that might escalate to nuclear war.  </span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Iran could be building &quot;the bomb&quot;. Iran would then be the second power in the region to possess the bomb, and would certainly be the first of what will soon be a rapid escalation of regional states with the wealth and wherewithal to acquire the bomb. In addition, this proliferation of bomb-owning states is a function of economics, and as such, is inevitable, its containment improbable by any rational measure. Finally, the &quot;bomb&quot; itself is nothing more than a bargaining chip among established bomb-owning states to advance their own self interests- all hinging around ... oil. Pakistan has a lot of nuclear bombs, and is one of the most unstable nation-states in the world. It has the bomb because its hated rival India has its own set of bombs. Israel has a whack of over 200 bombs, none of which are regulated in any way by anybody. It's a secret. Americans have the bomb. American has thousands of bombs, is the only nation to have ever used the bomb, and currently has a collection of the best of them scattered in and around their vassal state, Iraq. There are lots of bombs in the Middle East, their plurality irrelevant where the simple act of just firing a single one can and will do the job of melting down the Western world. All the bombs that do exist in the Middle East - or anywhere else there is land, sea, or space above - are in the possession of well advanced technological states with the enormous amounts of wealth needed to design, build, and maintain a weapon of unimaginable cost. Except Pakistan and North Korea, who simply stole their way in through the back door, and are the most poorly dressed members at the party. As it is the nature of our global economic system that wealth is power, and growth means wealth, the onward march of progress will bring more and more emerging nations into a position where they too can have the bomb. We have the first Muslim bomb in Pakistan, the first Jewish bomb in Israel, and we could soon have the first Persian bomb. We need an Arab bomb now, one would guess, to complete the set. Turkey will need the bomb, and will soon be able to afford one. That would be an unbroken chain of bomb-wielding states stretching from the Taiwan Strait to the Suez Canal, covering every major religion, culture, and form of politics. A veritable bomb &quot;beltway&quot; if you will. Poor Africa, no bomb for you. So, there are lots of bombs in the most unstable region of the world, and there are destined to be more. Iran could be one of them. Given the bigger picture, why does that matter? If Iran had the bomb - so what? In fact, Iran without a bomb makes the place just a smidgen less stable than Iran with the bomb, and a smidgen in the nuclear age is a lot. If nations feel compelled to carve gargantuan amounts of productivity out of their people for bombs, it is because of the lessons learned as worthless peons in the golden age of the Cold War. Money talks, and money is best represented by the bomb. Like feathered plumage, a radiating display of nuclear quills signals to everybody that there will be consequences to their most impolite actions. Far from being an offensive doomsday machine, the lesson of the Cold War is that the bomb is a superb defensive weapon. Fraught with the fear and danger of unknown futures, a parked nuclear warhead is a menacing threat. Once fired, it is useless, spent on well understood, mutual, and arithmetically assured destruction. To be effective, that parked nuke must have a threat of equal veracity to threaten it. Every nuke needs an enemy. The failure to provide a compensating catastrophic consequence for the use of a bomb makes it perfectly rational to use one. <strong>Want to add stability to the world? Give Iran the bomb.</strong> Just give them a bunch. That takes not just those, but all regional bombs off the table, turning a parcel of offensive weapons into a bushel of defensive ones. It's called &quot;Game Theory&quot;, and is an essential component to every bomb-owner's manual. A perfectly rational series of mathematical equations that have ruled the atomic age since physicists played poker. A systems analysis of the range of decisions a bomb owner must make to maximize his position without breaking 21. Game Theory predicts that nuclear superiority rests on what the other guy is thinking about you. It insists that both parties must have a credible threat, each threat with consequences that each player feels is not in his long term interests. Mutually assured destruction rests on the balance and parity of each side's threat. Without that parity, <strong>imbalance makes the use of a nuke almost certain</strong> in circumstances where parity would otherwise prevail. This was, and is an American doctrine. However, it has come to develop into the basic architecture of deterrence in the nuclear age. When Americans struggle to insist that a nuclear Iran is bad for everybody, they understand perfectly the irrationality of the condemnation. Americans warn that an Iran with the bomb would use it on Israel, and is the sole reason Iran is possibly pursuing one at all. Israel argues it must stop Iran as it is an &quot;existential&quot; threat to their existence, and thus, an Iranian bomb the very end of that existence. Both know otherwise of course. Both know that should the Iranians get the bomb, they will not fire the one or two they have at Israel and the United States. That action has virtually no offsetting effect on their enemies to ever come close to the punishment they would suffer in return for the decision. They won't make that call, <strong>which explains why they have not invaded another country for 600 years</strong> and have a civilization that stretches back thousands. They are not a stupid people. So what's all the fuss about? Iran has oil. Iran is the world's fourth-largest crude exporter, a card carrying charter member of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that pumps in excess of two-and-a-half million barrels a day of clean, inexpensive black goo. Iran's reserves of clean crude are the third-largest in the world. Iran also controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 40% of the Western world's oil flows, and is a long fly ball from Saudi Arabia's biggest oil export hub at Ras Tanura. Iran is wealthy enough to build a bomb because Iran has oil. Iran is a threat to the West's oil supply, as well as the Arab players who are traditional enemies of the Persians. Iran is also across the street from Iraq and thus, in America's backyard. Israel is in Iran's front yard, the home of 5,000 years of history between Persians and Jews. Iran sits atop a veritable sea of the world's most precious strategic commodity, and is surrounded by well-intentioned Western interests aligned with its enemies, all of whom possess the bomb. So Iran wants a bomb. No kidding. Iran sells 16% of its oil exports to China, about 411 million barrels a day and rising, and is China's second-largest source of crude after Saudi Arabia. China needs oil in quantities never before imagined to fuel its growth, and is scouring the world for wall flowers untouched by political ideology. China is buying up Africa under the noses of the squabbling Cold War warriors, and has no dog in the ancient races of the Middle East. It needs oil and that's all, and it has invested over $100 billion in Iran to prove it. China considers Iran a new friend in a formerly insular world. And a friend in need is a friend indeed. China has its own regional threats, and one of them is India, another of those traditional enemy types that drive Western sensibilities nuts. A China-friendly, oil-soaked Iran is a wonderful way to influence India from another direction. China, of course, has the bomb. India has the bomb as well, but is also one of the world's other great centers of progress. India needs as much oil as China for all the same reasons, and imports almost as much as China from Iran. A full third of Iran's oil exports go to the super developing economies of China and India. In addition, Iran imports back a great deal of its oil exports to India in the form of refined gasoline, making it the perfect stratified business model, and stupid profitable for all concerned. For both China and India, an Iranian bomb would mean security for their oil resources and investments. Without one, each would have to make decisions about threats to their oil supplies - as they do now. It also helps to have a well-defended oil head that is willing to defend their price point interests as well. Having access to oil is one thing, being able to pay for it is another. Russia does not want Iran to have the bomb. Russia is in the enviable position of being a world leader in both the bomb and oil. They have loads of each. By supplying Iran with technological support for their &quot;civilian&quot; nuclear program, the Russians are taking care of business on several different fronts. If a bomb were built in Iran, it would cause instability in the short run, and that would help support the oil prices Russia needs to maintain its own progressive economic agenda. Furthermore, Russia can mitigate the speed and scope of Iranian nuclear development, a fact not unknown to American statesmen. For Russia, the Iranian bomb thingy is a perfect bargaining chip for use in extracting both geographic security and open markets from the Americans. If the Iranians are going to develop a bomb, they figure, it might as well be with them. It's good business and it extends Russian influence into the Middle East through the regions latest hegemon. Russia shares nuclear proliferation concerns with America, however. It is absolutely essential that the former Cold War enemies contain the spread of bomb-equipped nations. Each is facing crippling expense in building and maintaining vast, unnecessary nuclear arsenals. Game Theory demanded an ever-increasing build up in arms to maintain the deterrent value and effect. The point at which theory left and insanity stepped in is hard to discern, however contemporary leaders in both America and Russia are learning that as long as each reduces arms at a rate that does not disturb the equilibrium, both can save a bunch of time, trouble and money. The increase in nuclear states threatens to keep this threat floor artificially high, and eat into projected billions of dollars saved. It would be tough to decide who needs oil more, America or China. Each is approaching the issue from different directions. China is quietly using its Goliath state industries to buy up the resources of the Earth necessary to power its future. It can do this because capitalism is becoming no match for state-controlled resource acquisition. At the same time, America has been foiled in its attempt to use its super power status and invincible military machine to project influence over the most important sources of ready oil in the world. Addicted to oil, America depends solely on the strength of free markets now to keep a tenuous grip on its future supply. America needs not just oil, however, but politically predictable prices for oil to defend its economy and the US dollar that the economy supports. America has an arsenal of bomb and bomb-like technology that has become so large it has made its investment pointless. Even an untoward glance towards the button, and an economic thermal nuclear explosion would blow through every household in America. $7.00 a gallon gasoline. War-making in America is approaching a trillion dollars a year and it has done nothing to protect America's most strategic asset, the oil it needs but doesn't have. America is also friends with both the Saudis and the Israelis, each of whom are sworn enemies of each other. America exchanges military hardware and their nuclear umbrella over the Saudis in exchange for oil, unfettered access to history's most epic sinkhole of energy, and simply scads of money. The Saudis need this protection from its neighbors, the late, great Saddam Hussein and his heretical secularist Islamic state, and the dreaded Persians. The shield is useless against a bomb-laden Israel though. Israel is justifiably nervous about the geographic reality the British left them in 1948. Israel imports absolutely everything of value, oil included. It also sits atop the most irrationally contested real estate in all of human civilization. Attacking threats without the bomb mercilessly has proven to be well worth the penalties on every occasion. That is because the penalty for attacking an existential threat that can unleash holy hell on its principal ally is several orders of magnitude greater. An Iranian nuclear response to an aggressive Israel would have ramifications that no theory of games could ever envision. Absolutely no one is in a position to imagine what may come next. What would China do about its investment in Iran? India? How would Pakistan react to India? What would the Russians do - sit back and watch the show, the price of their massive oil supplies rocketing skyward? What on earth would the Americans do? Who can tell and what's more, who wants to find out? Nobody. America should simply give Iran the bomb. That is the rational solution to the problem. Iran could most possibly get one regardless, and if it does it would lean on Russia for support. A nuclear Iran would restore parity to the insanity of nuclear gamesmanship, and provide everybody with the same rational consequence to its foreign policy decisions. Being supported by America, an Iranian nuclear program would be inoculated against a very real and probable Israeli threat. Iran would have no further use for its traditional tools of regional power like Hezbollah in Lebanon. This also guarantees China and India oil security, and checks the expansion of Russian influence over Iran which, incidentally, sits between Iraq and Afghanistan. America exchanges arms for oil market stability, and everybody wins.  </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">China's internal dynamism creates external ambitions</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. Empires rarely come about by design; they grow organically. As states become stronger, they cultivate new needs and--this may seem counterintuitive--apprehensions that force them to expand in various forms. Even under the stewardship of some of the most forgettable presidents--Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, Chester Arthur, Benjamin Harrison--the United States? economy grew steadily and quietly in the late nineteenth century. As the country traded more with the outside world, it developed complex economic and strategic interests in far-flung places. Sometimes, as in South America and the Pacific region, for example, these interests justified military action. The United States was also able to start focusing outward during that period because it had consolidated the interior of the continent; the last major battle of the Indian Wars was fought in 1890. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">China today is consolidating its land borders and beginning to turn outward. China's foreign policy ambitions are as aggressive as those of the United States a century ago, but for completely different reasons. China does not take a missionary approach to world affairs, seeking to spread an ideology or a system of government. Moral progress in international affairs is an American goal, not a Chinese one; China's actions abroad are <strong>propelled by its need to secure energy</strong>, metals, and strategic minerals in order to support the rising living standards of its immense population, which amounts to about one-fifth of the world's total. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential <strong>to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war</strong>, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study. </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Russian economic decline causes civil war—escalates and goes nuclear </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">David, 99</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> – Professor of Politics Science at Johns Hopkins (Steven, Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb, lexis) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">If <strong>internal war does strike</strong> Russia, economic deterioration will be a prime cause. From 1989 to the present, the GDP has fallen by 50 percent. In a society where, ten years ago, unemployment scarcely existed, it reached 9.5 percent in 1997 with many economists declaring the true figure to be much higher. Twenty-two percent of Russians live below the official poverty line (earning less than $ 70 a month). Modern Russia can neither collect taxes (it gathers only half the revenue it is due) nor significantly cut spending. Reformers tout privatization as the country's cure-all, but in a land without well-defined property rights or contract law and where subsidies remain a way of life, the prospects for transition to an American-style capitalist economy look remote at best. As the massive devaluation of the ruble and the current political crisis show, Russia's condition is even worse than most analysts feared. If conditions get worse, even the stoic Russian people will soon run out of patience. A future conflict would quickly draw in Russia's military. In the Soviet days civilian rule kept the powerful armed forces in check. But with the Communist Party out of office, what little civilian control remains relies on an exceedingly fragile foundation -- personal friendships between government leaders and military commanders. Meanwhile, the morale of Russian soldiers has fallen to a dangerous low. Drastic cuts in spending mean inadequate pay, housing, and medical care. A new emphasis on domestic missions has created an ideological split between the old and new guard in the military leadership, increasing the risk that disgruntled generals may enter the political fray and feeding the resentment of soldiers who dislike being used as a national police force. Newly enhanced ties between military units and local authorities pose another danger. Soldiers grow ever more dependent on local governments for housing, food, and wages. Draftees serve closer to home, and new laws have increased local control over the armed forces. Were a conflict to emerge between a regional power and Moscow, it is not at all clear which side the military would support. Divining the military's allegiance is crucial, however, since the structure of the Russian Federation makes it virtually certain that regional conflicts will continue to erupt. Russia's 89 republics, <em>krais,</em> and <em>oblasts</em> grow ever more independent in a system that does little to keep them together. As the central government finds itself unable to force its will beyond Moscow (if even that far), power devolves to the periphery. With the economy collapsing, republics feel less and less incentive to pay taxes to Moscow when they receive so little in return. Three-quarters of them already have their own constitutions, nearly all of which make some claim to sovereignty. Strong ethnic bonds promoted by shortsighted Soviet policies may motivate non-Russians to secede from the Federation. Chechnya's successful revolt against Russian control inspired similar movements for autonomy and independence throughout the country. If these rebellions spread and Moscow responds with force, civil war is likely. Should Russia succumb to internal war, the consequences for the United States and Europe will be severe. A major power like Russia -- even though in decline -- does not suffer civil war quietly or alone. An embattled Russian Federation might provoke opportunistic attacks from enemies such as China. Massive flows of refugees would pour into central and western Europe. Armed struggles in Russia could easily spill into its neighbors. Damage from the fighting, particularly attacks on nuclear plants, would poison the environment of much of Europe and Asia. Within Russia, the consequences would be even worse. Just as the sheer brutality of the last Russian civil war laid the basis for the privations of Soviet communism, a second civil war might produce another horrific regime. Most alarming is the real possibility that the violent disintegration of Russia could lead to loss of control over its nuclear arsenal. No nuclear state has ever fallen victim to civil war, but even without a clear precedent the grim consequences can be foreseen. Russia retains some 20,000 nuclear weapons and the raw material for tens of thousands more, in scores of sites scattered throughout the country. So far, the government has managed to prevent the loss of any weapons or much material. If war erupts, however, Moscow's already weak grip on nuclear sites will slacken, making weapons and supplies available to a wide range of anti-American groups and states. Such dispersal of nuclear weapons represents the greatest physical threat America now faces. And it is hard to think of anything that would increase this threat more than the chaos that would follow a Russian civil war. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Since the advent of the nuclear age, scientists, activists, academics, and politicians have feared that the spread of atomic weapons would prove unstoppable. The rhetoric one hears today regarding the probable reaction of Middle Eastern countries to a nuclear Iran echoes concerns put forth by experts when the Soviet Union, China, and even France got the bomb. Yet the <strong>worst-case scenarios rarely came to pass</strong> -- Germany and Japan, for instance, remained nonnuclear despite expectations -- and there is no reason to suspect that the Middle East will buck this historical trend. Analysts are particularly concerned about the reactions of countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia to an Iranian nuclear program. What they seem to forget is that the Arab world already has been living with a nuclear neighbor, Israel -- a state against which many Arab countries have fought wars and still do not recognize. Still, the Arab world has been unable or unwilling to respond in kind. An Iranian nuclear capability would not threaten these states more, or even as much as, an Israeli weapon. And in terms of prestige and influence, a Persian bomb should not be any more significant to these states than a Jewish one. Furthermore, developing a nuclear weapon is not as simple as flipping a switch. Libya spent close to two decades trying to acquire a nuclear weapon before giving up its program in 2003. Technology has never been the region's strong suit, and even with A. Q. Khan-supplied centrifuge drawings readily available, it would be foolish to expect a rash of nuclear successes in the near future.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Instead of first striking—nuclear parity encourages Israel to disclose its arsenal and abandon aggression—this is the only chance for peace process success and long-term stability  </span></strong></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This mentality can mean that Israel misses opportunities to engage in peace talks with contiguous states, and its default reaction to apparently positive overtures can be to focus upon negative signals and dismiss conciliatory gestures. Although the Arab side in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute bears equal blame for the continuation of the conflict, many Israelis are concerned about the negative impact that the Israeli mentality has on peacemaking. Some of the most important critics of the present posture reside in the Israeli defence establishment itself, a significant minority of whom are concerned that the policy produces self-fulfilling prophecies. Most notably, Israel’s offensive military doctrine can create enemies where previously they did not exist. As technological advancements bring states previously located in Tel Aviv’s periphery into range, present doctrine demands that Israel must seek military dominance over an increasing number of distant countries, most notably Iran. Abrasive rhetoric from Tehran, most notably President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s call in October 2005 to wipe Israel off the map, does not help Israel to relinquish its longheld policy, even though there are no definitive signals indicating that Tehran is intent upon a return to its radical policies of the early 1980s. Nevertheless, for much of the last decade Israel has assumed the worst and spearheaded a campaign to isolate and weaken Iran. After 55 years of continuous conflict with the Islamic world, Israelis are exhausted. Even some of the most hawkish Israeli politicians are reaching the conclusion that the state cannot adhere to such a stance indefinitely, particularly as Israel’s military doctrine is bringing it into conflict with a state that has no historical grievances against them. According to a senior analyst with the Bureau of Defense Policy Planning, there is a general reluctance to accept this, as it offers de facto recognition of Iran’s nuclearisation and Israel losing its military edge. What some call resignation, others refer to as a change of mindset. Reuven Pedatzur, director of the Galilee Centre for Strategy and National Security, has long asserted that Israel’s defence establishment needs new patterns of thinking. But paradigm shifts are usually born out of momentous events, and the loss of Israel’s nuclear monopoly in the region may constitute such a trigger. Future doctrine If disparity is lost, it will most likely prompt two key developments that some argue can gain Israel the peace and stability that military superiority failed to produce. First, a new military doctrine will be adopted – mutual assured destruction (MAD). This will compel Israel to end its long-standing policy of nuclear ambiguity. The crystallising geopolitical rivalry between Israel and Iran has been ambiguous precisely because Israel felt it had the ability to pursue a complete victory. Under nuclear parity, however, that option will be lost and ambiguity will be replaced with deterrence. Unlike the current situation, deterrence requires communication. Ambiguities cannot be resolved and red lines established unless channels of communication are opened between Tehran and Tel Aviv. Increased communication “can have positive effects on the relationship between Iran and Israel,” according to Leon Hadar, an Israeli research fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington DC, as it will end the dangers inherent in the current state of uncertainty. The existence of nuclear weapons programmes can <strong>tame the behaviour of both sides</strong> and reduce the probability of overt aggression, since the cost of failure will be infinitely greater than at present. Deterrence also forces Israel to ascribe to Tehran a level of rationality presently absent in its thinking. For instance, Project Daniel, a report written by foreign policy and military experts delivered to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004, argued that the existential threat to Israel was exacerbated by the fact that Arab and Iranian leaders were irrational and did not value self preservation. Such an approach can be viewed as political posturing consistent with Israel’s overarching military policy. As long as Israel’s strategic edge could be salvaged, all means had to be used to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear technology. This included the depiction of Iranian decision-makers as irrational in order to compel the international community to take action. As it becomes clear that disparity will be lost, such a portrayal will lose much of its political utility. Beyond the rhetoric Looking beyond the ‘mad mullah’ rhetoric, Israelis are careful not to underestimate Tehran. Yaari told JIR: “People here respect the Iranians and the Iranian regime. They take them as very serious, calculating players.” Most Israeli strategists differentiate between extremism and irrationality: although they view the Iranian government as extreme in its views, they do not see it as irrational. Therefore, deterring an Iranian nuclear threat has a strong chance of success, precisely because Tehran understands the price of a nuclear clash. Israel has already taken steps to strengthen its deterrence. In mid-November, it emerged that Israel’s government had signed a letter of intent with its German counterpart to receive two modified Dolphin-class advanced attack submarines (in addition to its existing three Dolphin-class submarines). Israel has repeatedly failed to confirm reports that the submarines are meant to create a second-strike capability to deter potential enemies who possess weapons of mass destruction. Israel refers to the Dolphin submarines as “national deterrence assets”, but an Israeli analyst confirmed to JIR that the submarines purchases were intended to signal a second-strike capability. In addition, the Israeli Air Force has an inventory of 25 F-15I aircraft with a range of 4,450 km. When combined with the Dolphin class submarines (and presuming that they afford a genuine second-strike capability) the F-15I ensure that Israel will be able to retaliate against a nuclear assault. Moreover, nuclear rivalry with Iran will increase the cost of Israel’s state of nonpeace with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians. Iran’s nuclear umbrella can embolden the radical Arabs and even prompt Israel’s more moderate neighbours into acting more aggressively. Fear of this scenario could compel Israel to accelerate the peace process as a preventive measure. Tel Aviv will not be able to afford a conflict with its regional adversaries and a nuclear rivalry with Tehran at the same time. Israel will be pushed to minimise its conflicts with its immediate neighbours in order to be better equipped to deal with the rivalry and threat catalysed by Iran. This pattern in Israeli behaviour has been evident before; one of Yitzhak Rabin’s primary motivations for making peace with the Palestinians in the early 1990s was to better prepare Israel for future conflict scenarios with states such as Iran. Furthermore, reduced tensions with Israel’s immediate neighbours will deprive Tehran of points of hostility that it can use against Tel Aviv. An understanding with Lebanon and Syria will significantly weaken the Iranian influence in those countries, as well as their need for military ties to Iran. Brigadier- General Shlomo Brom, former chief of the Strategic Planning Division of the Israeli Defense Forces, maintained: “If Israel succeeds in concluding an agreement with Syria, that will deny Iran a major instrument of friction with Israel.” Paradoxically, these factors – deterrence rather than domination and the increased communication between Iran and Israel that it entails, as well as Israel’s need to resolve disputes with its neighbours to limit friction with Iran – can serve to <strong>advance stability</strong> in the Middle East. Although the difficulty in maintaining Israel’s quantitative military supremacy is becoming clear to an increasing number of Israeli strategists, only liberal elements in the military and academia have so far openly argued for the benefits of parity. The difficulty in preventing advances in Iran’s nuclear programme is forcing many in Israel to look beyond the doomsday scenario Tel Aviv has portrayed it to be and reassess the implications of a nuclear balance of power. In particular, it is becoming increasingly clear that the only remedy to a nuclear Iran emboldening Syria, Hizbullah and the Palestinians is to hasten efforts to conclude peace deals with the Arabs and not to ‘bargain out’ and expect Israel’s military superiority to predetermine the result of the negotiations. The cost of continuing the state of ‘no war, no peace’ will outweigh the benefits of holding on to occupied territory at the expense of peace. As the prospects for nuclear parity force Israel to rid itself of the doctrine that has kept it in a state of perpetual conflict since the Yom Kippur War, it will be balance and not imbalance of power that finally will win Israel the peace it has craved for so long. “I think [that] in the long run, it will be good for the Middle East,” Pedatzur told JIR. “Because the deterrence will work just as it worked between the superpowers.” [1]  </span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Then there's the &quot;irrational Arab leader&quot; argument. In conventional warfare, there's ample room for miscalculating costs, and so for gambling on aggressive behavior. But with nuclear weapons, the costs are clearly so high as to make the risk unacceptable. An Arab leader who launched a nuclear attack against Israel would not only destroy what is presumably valued - Palestine - but risk the destruction of Jerusalem, the dangers of nuclear fallout, and the international political backlash, not to mention Israel's presumed ability to launch an annihilating counterstrike. As using nuclear weapons offers high costs and no gains, even someone like Saddam Hussein would understand that the risks of threatening Israel are unacceptable. If the slippery slope leads to annihilation, who would take the first step?</span></span><br />

Notice next that at least ten times biodiversity fell rapidly; none of these extreme reductions in biodiversity were caused by humans. Around 250 million years ago the number of genera was reduce 85 percent from about 1200 to around 200, by any definition a significant reduction in biodiversity. Now notice that after this extinction a steep and rapid rise of biodiversity. In fact, if you look closely at the curve, you will find that every mass-extinction was followed by a massive increase in biodiversity. Why was that? Do you suppose it had anything to do with the number environmental niches available for exploitation? If you do, you are right. Extinctions are necessary for creation. Each time a mass extinction occurs the world is filled with new and better-adapted species. That is the way evolution works, its called survival of the fittest. Those species that could not adapted to the changing world conditions simply disappeared and better species evolved. How efficient is that? Those that could adapt to change continued to thrive. For example, the cockroach and the shark have been around well over 300 million years. There is a pair to draw to, two successful species that any creator would be proud to produce. To date these creatures have successful survived six extinctions, without the aid of humans or the EPA. Now notice that only once in the last 500 million years did life ever exceed 1500 genera, and that was in the middle of the Cretaceous Period around 100 million years ago, when the dinosaurs exploded on the planet. Obviously, biodiversity has a bad side. The direct result of this explosion in biodiversity was the extinction of the dinosaurs that followed 45 million years later at the KT boundary. It is interesting to note, that at the end of the extinction the number of genera had returned to the 1500 level almost exactly. Presently biodiversity is at an all time high and has again far exceeded the 1500 genera level. Are we over due for another extinction? A closer look at the KT extinction 65 million years ago reveals at least three things. First the 1500 genera that remained had passed the test of environmental compatibility and remained on the planet. This was not an accident. Second, these extinctions freed niches for occupation by better-adapted species. The remaining genera now faced an environment with hundreds of thousands of vacant niches. Third, it only took about 15 million years to refill all of those niches and completely replaced the dinosaurs, with new and better species. In this context, a better species is by definition one that is more successful in dealing with a changing environment.<br />

The ESA manifests no evidence that its drafters understood the biological realities and history of extinction. As discussed earlier, species have been evolving and going extinct since the daybreak of life on this planet. During several epochs, huge numbers of species went out of existence at roughly the same time, greatly reducing earth's biodiversity. Most of these millions of extinction events took place without any human involvement; in fact most of them preceded man's arrival as a species. These extinctions were caused by climatic shifts, competitive inferiority [*560] compared to other or newer species, habitat alteration, and other factors quite unrelated to Homo sapiens. Included among the myriad species that died out before the human era are some of the most spectacular, successful, and fascinating &quot;charismatic megafauna&quot; of all time -- the multitudinous varieties of dinosaurs and giant mammals. As much as we might crave the opportunity to see these creatures alive today, the fact remains that their extinction evidently was necessary for life on earth to evolve in such a way that other species such as humans could thrive. Evolution cannot proceed without the extinction of organisms that are less well-adapted to changing conditions. Yet, if humans and the ESA had somehow existed at the time, we would have been required to stand in the path of evolutionary progress. Despite the unquestionable benefits to mankind and other species from the disappearance of the previously dominant dinosaurs, the ESA would have forced us to try to preserve them. The notion that some extinctions are desirable might seem callous or cynical, and it certainly is subject to overuse and exploitation; but it is also true. Extinction is an essential part of the brutal, unforgiving struggle that is evolution. It clears limited habitat and resources for use by the species that are best adapted for current conditions, thus rewarding the life forms that have been most successful in the game of living. It is a natural method of weeding the garden, of filtering out the weaker, or inflexible, or anachronistic species so as to maximize the evolutionary fitness of the gene pool at any point in time.<br />

If biological evolution really is a self-organised Earth-life system there are some very important consequences. One is that life on this planet continues despite internal and external setbacks, because it is the system that recovers at the expense of some of its former parts. For example, the end of the dinosaurs enabled mammals to diversify. Otherwise if the exponential rise were to reach infinity, there would not be space or food to sustain life. It would come to a stop. Extinctions are necessary to retain life on this planet.<br />

<br />
The same trend of long-drawn-out survival of the final relicts has been further considered by Bob May's group at Oxford, particularly Sean Nee. The Oxford group are vociferous wailers of gloom and doom: 'Extinction episodes, such as the anthropogenic one currently under way, result in a pruned tree of life.' But they go on to argue that the vast majority of groups survive this pruning, so that evolution goes on, albeit along a different path if the environment is changed. Indeed, the fossil record has taught us to expect a vigorous evolutional response when the ecosystem changes significantly. This kind of research is more evidence to support the idea that evolution thrives on culling. The planet did really well from the Big Five mass-extinction events. The victims' demise enabled new environments to develop and more diversification took place in other groups of animals and plants. Nature was the richer for it. In just this same way the planet can take advantage from the abuse we are giving it. The harder the abuse, the greater the change to the environment. But it also follows that it brings forward the extinctions of a whole selection of vulnerable organisms.<br />

<br />
The system of life on Earth behaves in a similar way for all its measurable variables, whether they are communities or ecosystems. For sand grains, substitute species or genes. For avalanches, substitute extinctions. Power laws tell us that large avalanches or large extinctions are much less common than small ones. The controlling factors for the sand piles are weight and angle of the sides of the pile; for mammals they are space and food within the ecosystem. We can kick the sand pile with our feet, and we can reduce the space and the food by changing the environment. But what would happen to the life-Earth system without these external changes? Could it be like a pile without avalanches, eventually collapsing into white noise? The answer lies in our theory of exponential diversification within macro-evolution; the curve ever rising towards the vertical when the Fossil Record 2 Family data are plotted (see figure 3.5). The situation starts to become critical when numbers rise above a comfortable quantity, whether the system is a pile of sand, cars on a motorway or large mammals in America. If there were no mass extinctions, that exponential curve really could have risen to the truly vertical. It could have happened long ago, and it could happen again if there were no extinctions holding it back from the vertical. If that were so, all life on planet Earth would cease. It would need to start again from scratch.<br />

<br />
In short, deterrence cannot be a “bluff”. The idea that nuclear weapons are only to stop an attack on the US but once deterrence breaks down cannot be used in retaliation could render our deterrent less than credible in the eyes of our adversaries. The US has always had some variant of a policy of reducing through counterforce retaliatory strikes the potential further damage to the US and its allies that could come from nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons. In short, our retaliatory option against the weapons or bunkers or facilities of our adversaries gives us a counterforce capability which must be part of our deterrent equation. Otherwise, if as the Senator writes “we must recognize what these weapons are---not a deterrent”, this implies we could eliminate most if not all funding for our nuclear arsenal and rely solely on our conventional capability to deter our adversaries and reassure our allies. Such a policy would be fraught with peril. It is vitally important, I believe, that America’s leaders carefully weigh what we say about nuclear weapons, their purpose and their employ. As Jim Schlesinger, the former Secretary of Defense has recently warned, the deterioration of our nuclear enterprise, which started from the neglect of its maintenance at the end of the Cold War, may undermine both the strength of our own deterrent and our extended deterrent under which our allies remain protected. If such a problem is not fully resolved, our allies may seek their own nuclear arsenals and our adversaries such as Iran and North Korea may also be emboldened. I believe there is no contradiction between seeking lower levels of nuclear weapons and maintaining a deterrent second to none. Until we get to that rather dramatically transformed world where approaching zero nuclear weapons is in our national interest, we have no choice but to see to it that Job #1, maintaining a strong nuclear enterprise, is at the top of our priority list. I am fairly confident that we are not ready for a world in which we can reduce our nuclear arsenal to such an extent that it is no larger than all other nuclear armed states but that is probably the geostrategic environment through which we would have to pass to get to zero. However attractive such a world might appear in theory, there is no substitute now for the hard work of maintaining our nuclear deterrent in the most robust manner to ensure the safety of this and future generations. That is what our Founders called upon us to do: “Provide for the Common Defense”.<br />

<strong>A US nuclear strike is key to deter use of chemical and biological weapons</strong><br />

However, if enemy CBW attacks were directed against important targets in the American homeland, or if they caused horrific numbers of U.S. and allied casualties in the field, it might well be that U.S. public opinion then would sanction a U.S. nuclear retaliatory response. In that case, an aroused American public might demand harsh nuclear retribution. Nuclear weapons have been used just twice in history and that was over half a century ago. There is likely to be a gradual erosion in the ability of the United States to deter military action by others with their threatened use as nuclear weapons become progressively delegitimized. Some analysts argue that at present the &quot;non-use ethos has become so persuasive that nuclear deterrence is no longer credible.&quot;14 Some believe that while any nuclear explosion anywhere would be a local disaster, there would be at least one global silver lining. Nuclear deterrence would be more credible and might then better scare off the enemy's use of chemical and biological weapons. For this reason, one analyst has provocatively suggested that &quot;the sooner a nuclear weapon is used in the world the better, on the grounds that only then will the United States and other nuclear powers be able to develop a credible strategy against weapons of mass destruction.”15 Some Rand Corporation analysts suggest that the United States make a nuclear declaratory policy statement that it will use such atomic arms in response to any NBC attacks. This announced policy would go beyond the “belligerent reprisal” doctrine that merely argues that it is legal to do so. Such a policy would say the United States would consider itself free to use nuclear arms against such WMD aggressors. This, it is argued, would help to dispel thinking by rogue state leaders that the United States may not be willing to escalate to the nuclear option. However, for those states that sign, ratify and simultaneously adhere to the NPT, CWC, and BWC pacts, these same analysts argue that the United States should make a “no first use” pledge regarding its nuclear forces. 16 Against a NASTI, U.S. nuclear threats and, if necessary, nuclear weapons employment might have a number of advantages over U.S. biological and chemical weapons responses in kind. 17 The compellence advantage of making a nuclear threat is that employment of such weapons could indeed inflict &quot;unacceptable levels of damage&quot; on almost any adversary. This is especially true in some areas of the world where one or two targets are of supreme cultural, economic, or political value to that society or state and where even a small nuclear strike could inflict ruinous damage on those targets. In the Middle East, for example, one analyst talks about most states being &quot;one bomb states,&quot;18 countries that would be ruined if their capital or major city were destroyed. It is highly unlikely that the United States today would elect to bomb a populated area where many civilians live in order to retaliate, but the Hiroshima and Nagasaki precedent <em>does</em> exist, and this precedent might make a NASTI think twice before starting the first use of weapons of mass destruction.<br />

<br />
<strong>I served as an arms negotiator on the last two agreements before the dissolution of the Soviet Union and have spent most of my career enmeshed in the complexity of nuclear weapons issues on the government side of the table. It is abundantly clear (to me) that formulating a new nuclear weapons policy for the start of the 21st Century will be a most difficult undertaking. While the often over-simplified picture of deterrence during the Cold War—two behemoths armed to the teeth, staring each other down—has thankfully retreated into history, there are nevertheless huge arsenals of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, all in quite usable states, that could be brought back quickly to their Cold War postures<span style="color: black;">.</span>Additionally, throughout the Cold War and ever since, there has been a steady proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction by other nations around the globe. The vast majority of these newly armed states are not U.S. allies<span style="color: black;">, </span>and some already are exhibiting hostile behaviors, while others have the potential to become aggressors toward the U.S., our allies, and our international interests. Russia has already begun to emphasize the importance of its arsenal of nuclear weapons to compensate for its limited conventional capabilities to deal with hostilities that appear to be increasing along its borders. It seems inescapable that the U.S. must carefully think through how we should be preparing to deal with new threats from other corners of the world, including the role that nuclear weapons might serve in deterring these threats from ever reaching actual aggressions. I personally see the abolition of nuclear weapons as an impractical dream in any foreseeable future. I came to this view from several directions. The first is the impossibility of ever “uninventing” or erasing from the human mind the knowledge of how to build such weapons. While the sudden appearance of a few tens of nuclear weapons causes only a small stir in a world where several thousands of such weapons already exist, their appearance in a world without nuclear weapons would produce huge effects. (The impact of the first two weapons in ending World War II should be a sufficient example.) I believe that the words of Winston Churchill, as quoted by Margaret Thatcher to a special joint session of the U.S. Congress on February 20, 1985, remain convincing on this point: “Be careful above all things not to let go of the atomic weapon until you are sure, and more sure than sure, that other means of preserving the peace are in your hands.” Similarly, it is my sincere view that the majority of the nations who<span style="color: black;"> have now</span>acquired arsenals of nuclear weapons believe them to be such potent tools for deterring conflicts that they would never surrender them. Against this backdrop, I recently began to worry that because there were few public statements by U.S. officials in reaffirming the unique role which nuclear weapons play in ensuring U.S. and world security, far too many people (including many in our own armed forces) were beginning to believe that perhaps nuclear weapons no longer had value. It seemed to me that it was time for someone to step forward and articulate the other side of these issues for the public: first, that nuclear weapons remain of vital importance to the security of the U.S. and to our allies and friends (today and for the near future); and second, that nuclear weapons will likely have an enduring role in preserving the peace and preventing world wars for the foreseeable future. These are my purposes in writing this paper. For the past eight years, I have served several Commanders-in-Chief of the U.S. Strategic Command by chairing the Policy Subcommittee of the Strategic Advisory Group (SAG). This group was asked to help develop a new terms of reference for nuclear strategy in the post-Cold War world. This paper draws on many of the discussions with my SAG colleagues (although one must not assume their endorsement of all of the ideas presented here). We addressed how nuclear deterrence might be extended—not just to deter Russia—but how it might serve a continuing role in deterring wider acts of aggression from any corner of the world, including deterring the use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. [Taken together, these are normally referred to as Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).] My approach here will be to: (1) examine what might be the appropriate roles for nuclear weapons for the future, (2) propose some new approaches to developing nuclear strategies and policies that are more appropriate for the post-Cold War world, and (3) consider the kinds of military systems and nuclear weapons that would be needed to match those policies. The Role(s) of Nuclear Weapons The Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Command, Admiral Rich Mies, succinctly reflected the current U.S. deterrent policy last year in testimony to the U.S. Senate: “Deterrence of aggression is a cornerstone of our national security strategy, and strategic nuclear forces serve as the most visible and most important element of our commitment Š (further) deterrence of major military attack on the United States and its allies, particularly attacks involving weapons of mass destruction, remains our highest defense priority.” While the application of this policy seemed clear, perhaps we could have said even “straightforward,” during the Cold War; application of that policy becomes even more complicated if we consider applying it to any nation other than Russia. Let me first stress that nuclear arms must never be thought of as a single “cure-all” for security concerns. For the past 20 years, only 10 percent of the U.S. defense budget has been spent on nuclear forces. The other 90 percent is for “war fighting” capabilities. Indeed, conflicts have continued to break out every few years in various regions of the globe, and these nonnuclear capabilities have been regularly employed. By contrast, we have not used nuclear weapons in conflict since World War II. This is an important distinction for us to emphasize as an element of U.S. defense policy, and one not well understood by the public at large. Nuclear weapons must never be considered as war fighting tools. Rather we should rely on the catastrophic nature of nuclear weapons to achieve war prevention, to prevent a conflict from escalating (e.g., to the use of weapons of mass destruction), or to help achieve war termination when it cannot be achieved by other means, e.g., if the enemy has already escalated the conflict through the use of weapons of mass destruction. Conventional armaments and forces will remain the backbone of U.S. defense forces, but the inherent threat to escalate to nuclear use can help to prevent conflicts from ever starting, can prevent their escalation, as well as bring these conflicts to a swift and certain end. In contrast to the situation facing Russia, I believe we cannot place an over-reliance on nuclear weapons<span style="color: black;">, </span>but that we must maintain adequate conventional capabilities to manage regional conflicts in any part of the world. Noting that the U.S. has always considered nuclear weapons as “weapons of last resort,” we need to give constant attention to improving conventional munitions in order to raise the threshold for which we would ever consider nuclear use. It is just as important for our policy makers to understand these interfaces as it is for our commanders. Defenses Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to strictly consider “defensive” tactics and armaments, I believe it is important for the United States to consider a continuum of defensive capabilities, from boost phase intercept to terminal defenses. Defenses have always been an important element of war fighting, and are likely to be so when defending against missiles. Defenses will also provide value in deterring conflicts or limiting escalations. Moreover, the existence of a credible defense to blunt attacks by armaments emanating from a rogue state could well eliminate that rogue nation’s ability to dissuade the U.S. from taking military actions. If any attack against the U.S., its allies, or its forces should be undertaken with nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, there should be no doubt in the attacker’s mind that the United States might retaliate for such an attack with nuclear weapons; but the choice would be in our hands.</strong>
