<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The Russian Impact on the U.S. and Canada Aside from building an ACRL, which would be the foundational stage, stages two and three of creating a Bering Strait crossing really involve Russia. Frankly, there is no reason to lay track in Alaska between Fairbanks and Nome unless there is clear intent to connect to the Russian rail system. Privately, one senior Alaskan political leader admitted he supports eventually building a Bering Strait tunnel, but unless Russia and other countries (e.g., China, South Korea, Canada) clamor for it, the American side will never act on its own.[18] Without clear-cut demonstrations of international support and even insistence, from the American point-of-view this project will remain a pipe dream. Since 2007, </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Russia has expressed</span>____<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> noticeable interest in a Bering Strait tunnel according to press reports</span>__<span style="font-size: 5pt;">…</span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> It should be seen as a great global task of permanent **peace-building.** </span>__
