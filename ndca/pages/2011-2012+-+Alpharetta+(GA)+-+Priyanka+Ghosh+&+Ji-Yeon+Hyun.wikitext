**Affirmative Questions : [[mailto:ghosh895@gmail.com|ghosh895@gmail.com]] (Priyanka Ghosh)**
**Negative Questions : [[mailto:jiyeonh.1@gmail.com|jiyeonh.1@gmail.com]] (Ji-Yeon Hyun)**
=Affirmative= 
==LSP 1AC (Wake Forest)== 
===Plan=== 

**Thus the plan: The United States Federal Government should develop a Lunar Power system on the Earth's Moon**

===Advantage 1 is Japan=== 
**Growing number of Japanese organizations are looking toward LSP projects - Japanese earthquake and energy strategy**
**EcoBusiness 7/12**/11 -- Asia Business Magazine ("Is 'Luna Ring' the energy solution or looney pipe dream?" <http://www.ecobusiness.com/news/is-luna-ring-the-energy-solution-or-looney-pipe-dream/>)

When Tetsuji Yoshida first unveiled...chance this could become reality.

**New pressures for LSP could have Japan implementing projects as soon as 2035**
**The Independent 7/10**/11 -- respected international news firm ("Japanese firm looks to solar power from the moon" <http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/japanese-firm-looks-to-solar-power-from-the-moon-2311568.html>)

Given Japan's well-documented recent energy problems...potential of wind, wave and geothermal energy.

**Japanese LSP on the moon precludes US Space Dominance, we isolate 2 scenarios:**

**1) Japanese LSP would control key moon real estate, moon energy infrastructure, and ensure Japanese lunar resource exploitation**
**Shimizu Corp** 6/20**/11** ("Lunar Solar Power Generation: The Energy Paradigm Shift Opens the Door to a Sustainable Society" <http://www.shimz.co.jp/english/theme/dream/lunaring.html>, Shimizu is lead Japanese organization aiming to build LSP on the moon)

A shift from economical use...from lunar resources and installing them.

**2) Energy provided by LSP system is the lynchpin for moon control - first one to build controls future colonization, exploration, science stations, and inter-solar travel**
**Ignatiey et al** 20**01** -- Professor Aerospace @ Unv Houston ("In-situ Electric Power Generation to Support Solar System Exploration and Colonization: Manufacture of Thin Film Silicon Solar Cells on the Moon" <http://ieexplore.ieee.org.ezp-prodl.hul.harvard.edu/stamp/stamp.isp?tn+&arnumber=931705>, Harvard Database, quals for other authors - Duke - professor @ Colorado School of Mines, Rosenberg - researcher @ In Space Propulsion, Ltd, Makel - owner and engineer @ Makel Engineering, Ltd)

Energy is fundamental to nearly everything...energy needed for the development of space.

**We isolate two impact scenarios:**

**1) Hegemony:**

**Lunar dominance is critical to overall leadership -- bolsters hard and soft power -- now is key**
**Spudis 10** - Paul D. Spudis, Senior Staff Scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, February 9, 2010, "The New Space Race," online: http://www.spudislunarresources.com/Opinion_Editorial/NewSpaceRace.pdf

In one of his early speeches...abandon the Vision for Space Exploration.

**Heg solves all impacts**
**Thayer** 20**06** [Bradley -- Pro. of security studies at Missouri State, "In Defense of Primacy", //The National Interest,// November/December, p.32-37]

A grand strategy based on American primacy...the equivalent of a blitzkreig.

**2) Lunar Resources**

**Lunar Exploration and Settlements are key to He3 mining and US Space Leadership**
**Jeffrey 5/26** (Terrence P. Jeffrey, Editor in Chief of CNS News, "Former Moon Astronaut and Senator: U.S. Should Settle Moon and Mars" http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/former-moon-astronaut-and-senator-us-sho, 5/26/2011)

He now believes America's political leadership...ideal fuel for nuclear fusion reactors.

**Control of He3 resources is key to prevent future resource wars**
**Lasker 10** (John Lasker, Freelance Jouranlist - Major contributor for magazines (eg. Wired & Christian Science Monitor), "Technoir", http://www.godlikeproductions.com/foruml/message1363174/pgl. 4/3/2010)

Back in 1998, representatives from Halliburton...that ends the human race.

**Resource Wars cause extinction**
**Klare 6** (Michael T. Klare, Ph.D, Professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire University, "The Coming Resource Wars", http://alternet.org/story/33243/the_coming_resource_wars, 3/10/2006)

It's official: the era of resource wars...involvement in these forms of conflict

===Advantage 2 is Energy=== 

**Scenario 1 is Beaming:**

**Warming is real and caused by humans**
**Dessler 10** Andrew Dessler, professor atmospheric scienes, Texas A&M University; Katherine Hayhoe, research associate professor of atmospheric sciences, Texas Tech University; Charles Jackson, research scientist, Institute for Geophysics. The University of Texas Austin; Gerald North, distinguished professor of atmospheric sciences, Texas A&M University; Andre Droxler, professor of earth science and director of the Center for the Study of Environment and Society, Rice University; and Rong Fu, professor, Jackson School of Geosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, March 6, 2010, (Chronicle, On Global Warming, the science is solid, http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/outlook/6900556.html)

In recent months, e-mails stolen from...the dominant influence on our climate.

**LSP solves energy crisis and nurtures the biosphere -- provides cheap energy that trades off with harmful CO2-based fuel**
D **Criswell** 20**02** -- Director of the University of Houston's Institute for Space Systems Operation (//Innovative Solutions to CO2 Stabilization// <http://www.agci.org/dB/PDFs/Publications/EOC9851_book.pdf>, A Report of the Aspen Global Change Institute)

Most humans will remain very poor...ample power for all of humanity.

**Global warming destroys the planet**
Dr. **Brandenberg '99** (Physicist (Ph.D) and Paxson a science writer '99 - John and Monica, Dead Mars Dying Earth p. 232-3

The ozone hole expands, driven by...a few hardy microbes surviving.

**Scenario 2 is Dependence:**

**LSP solves fossil fuel dependence in the long term and reduces short term prices**
**Dinkin '5** [April 11, 2005, Sam Dinkin, Ph.D in Economics from the University of Arizona. Founder & CEO at Spaceshot, Inc. Rectifying the case for beaming lunar solar power, from the Space Review, http://www.spacereview.com/article/354/2; WBTR]

To think like the DoD...be ramped up very quickly.

**The U.S. is falling behind in energy dependence -- erodes leadership**
Alex Michael **Bonnici** 20**09,** involved with Atlantica Expeditions, appointed the European Union Liaison for the Undersea Colony project, physics teacher, Tuesday, January 20, 2009 (The Discovery Enterprise, "Solar Power Satellites: The Yes Case", http://discoveryenterprise.blogspot.com/2009/01/solar-power-satellites-yes-case.html)

Is now the time for major government...funding to date in comparison.

**Anthropogenic risks massively outweigh natural ones -- history is on our side**
Nick **Bostrom 09,** Professor in the Faculty of Philosophy & Oxford Martin School, Director of the Future of Humanity Institute, and Director of the Programme on the Impact of Future Technology at the University of Oxford, recipient of the 2009 Eugene R. Gannon Award for the Continued Pursuit of Human Advancement, holds a Ph.D in Philosophy from the London School of Economics, 2009 ("The Future of Humanity," //Geopolitics, History and International Relations,// Volume 9, Issue 2, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via ProQuest Research Library, Reprinted Online at http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/future.pdf, Accessed 07-06-2011, p.10-11)

The greatest extinction risks (and existential risks more generally)...still remain to be discovered.

**Must act now to prevent extinction**
**Tyree 08,** 7-13-08, Geologist Formerly @ State Dept. Env. Protection of West Virginia (Mel, Charleston Gazette, "We have one year to save climate", L/N)

It there is a silver lining...Arctic ice cap or we won't.

**Reducing existential risks __by even a tiny amount__ outweighs __every other impact__ -- the main is conclusively on our side**
Nick **Bostrom 11,** Professor in the Faculty of Philosophy & Oxford Martin School, Director of the Future of Humanity Institute, and Director of the Programme on the Impact of Future Technology at the University of Oxford, recipient of the 2009 Eugene R. Gannon Award for the Continued Pursuit of Human Advancement, holds a Ph.D in Philosophy from the London School of Economics, 2009 ("The Concept of Existential Risk", Draft of a Paper published on ExistentialRisk.com, Available Online at http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html, Accessed 07-04-2011)

Holding probability constant, risks become...benefit of such an action.

**Catastrophic impacts pale in comparison to exitential ones -- their impacts are recoverable setbacks while ours end the game**
Nick **Bostrom 09,** Professor in the Faculty of Philosophy & Oxford Martin School, Director of the Future of Humanity Institute, and Director of the Programme on the Impact of Future Technology at the University of Oxford, recipient of the 2009 Eugene R. Gannon Award for the Continued Pursuit of Human Advancement, holds a Ph.D in Philosophy from the London School of Economics, 2009 ("The Future of Humanity," //Geopolitics, History and International Relations,// Volume 9, Issue 2, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via ProQuest Research Library, Reprinted Online at http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/future.pdf, Accessed 07-06-2011, p.10-11)

Extinction risks constitute an especially severe...a small misstep for mankind.
