**__Contention One:__ "If You See Something, Say Something"**

**September 11 was a moment of profound loss—imperial illusions of grandeur and a timeless empire were temporarily shattered when the border that defined our exceptionalism was transgressed. This momentary suspension of our First-World privilege left us in a liminal space marked by grief, rage, and uncertainty. In this way, the question of the collective memory of September 11 becomes a choice between the re-assertion of our imperial monopoly on violence, or a radical openness to a democratic future.**
**Butler, 6** (Judith - Ph.D. in philosophy from Yale University in 1984, Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkley, the author of many books including "Antigone's Claim", "The Psychic Life of Power", "Excitable Speech", "Bodies That
Matter" and "Gender Trouble" - "Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence," page 39-40)
"Most Americans have probably experienced something like ... of democratic political culture here and elsewhere."

**Less than two weeks after 9/11, then President Bush let us know exactly which path we were choosing. Grieving and mourning would end, to be replaced with the righteous vengeance of a shocked empire. Fear and uncertainty could be resolved, the narrative went, by locating and destroying the terrorists. In the name of the victims of 9/11, we declared war on Afghanistan and re-asserted the monumental timelessness of American primacy.**

"Let us return to the issue of grief ... support for our lives at the other."

**In the name of our righteous vengeance—we have turned the Afghani people into disposable people which allows the government to kill them remorselessly. These deaths must be mourned.**
**Gregory, 4** (Derek, professor of geography at the University of British Columbia, “The Colonial Present”, pages 63-71)
"In November 2001 thousands of Taliban troops ... 14 in the first 3 months of 2003."

**We’re stuck in Afghanistan now, paralyzed by fear and insecurity, killing for no other reason than our fear that pulling out will lead to some catastrophe as predicted by experts beholden to the military industrial complex. We have to understand the ruse this occupation presents.**
**Englehardt, 10** (Tom, the creator of the Nation Institute's tomdispatch.com, the co-founder American Empire Project and the author of the 1998 book, The End of Victory Culture: Cold War America and the Disillusioning of a Generation Engelhardt graduated from Yale College and took a Master's degree in Area Studies from Harvard University, where he was a founding member of the Committee of Concerned

"Yes, we could. No kidding. We ... many Afghanistans (and Iraqs) in the years to come."

**This is a kind of material and discursive violence in which they are rendered inhuman and invisible; the prohibition on grieving makes the violence exponential, repeated again and again as we demand the negation of those already socially dead by their coding as targets in the glorious crusade on Afghanistan.**
**Butler, 4** (Judith - Ph.D. in philosophy from Yale University in 1984, Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkley, the author of many books including "Antigone's Claim", "The Psychic Life of Power", "Excitable Speech", "Bodies That

"A hierarchy of grief could no doubt ... for the most part unmarkable and ungrievable."

**This is a process repeated globally in the march of empire. Criticizing the way we were seduced by a war on Afghanistan brings into relief the ways in which we attempt to resolve insecurity at every register through the destruction of the racially and sexually aberrant other.**
**Agathangelou et al, 8** (Anna M Agathangelous, M Daniel Bassichis, Tamara L Spire, "Intimate Investments: Homonormativity, Global Lockdown, and the Seductions of Empire," http://www.makezine.enoughenough.org/intimateinvestments.pdf)
"To (re)consolidate itself, empire requires ... do not even merit mention of attention."

**Thus Eleanor and I advocate the United States Federal Government should implement a complete and unconditional withdrawal of military and police presence from Afghanistan.**

**__Contention 2:__ "We Will Not Forget"**

**Criticizing the nationalist invocation of 9/11 makes possible visions of a new future.**
**Luciano, 7** (Dana, Georgetown English Professor, “Arranging Grief: Sacred Time and the Body in Nineteenth-Century America”, The Coda)
"Talking with others about this project ... of inventing new futures."

**We haven’t been able to reflect upon the event of 9/11, instead the state has taken away both the time and meaning to reflect in effort tried to resolve the issue by proliferating violence, disaster and attacks in commemoration of the event.**
**Luciano, 7** (Dana, Georgetown English Professor, “Arranging Grief: Sacred Time and the Body in Nineteenth-Century America”, page 267)
"At the outset of this book, I asserted ... arranged in the service of this possibility."

**Prefer the plan—it’s an interruption of all the variables that distinguish a logical artifice for our status quo. Take the ethical risk for once.**
**Butler, 9** (Judith, Prof of Rhetoric at Berkeley, Frames of War, 182-184)
"Non-violence thus would seem to require ... frames by which war is wrought time and again"
