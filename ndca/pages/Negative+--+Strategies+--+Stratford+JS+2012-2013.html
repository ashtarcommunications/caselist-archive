<br />

<br />

<strong>Ours is not a critique of their goal but rather of their methodological framing of &quot;aesthetic lack&quot; as a &quot;root cause&quot;.

Their attempt to <u>locate</u> a center to violence is <u>precisely</u> the enabling condition for oppression, as it scripts the possibilities for resistance in advance.

<strong>Their argument defeats itself by debating ; the attempt to unravel logic and reason using thought itself is an attempt to render the spontaneous deliberate, which is a self-defeating, melancholic and forfeits the possibility of true passion. Let's be real for a second ; they aren't that radical, their argument isn't that complex and they aren't an injection of the new but a repetition of the same arguments that critical teams have been making for years ; they are just better at getting away with it! By enacting the use of their speech as argument, they sacrifice its mythical potential. Their desire for authenticity collapses into a pornographic narcissism, their insistence on an intuitive, impassioned effluence of meaning is the most deliberate lie of the debate</strong><br />

1.3 Definitions<br />
We define (net) public investment as public expenditure that adds to the public physical capital stock. This would include the building of roads, ports, schools, hospitals etc. This corresponds to the definition of public investment in national accounts data, namely, capital expenditure. It is not within the scope of this paper to include public expenditure on health and education, despite the fact that many regard such expenditure as investment. Methods for assessing the poverty impact of public expenditure on social sectors such as health and education have been well covered elsewhere in recent years (see for example, van de Walle and Nead, 1995; Sahn and Younger, 2000; and World Bank, 2002).<br />

A: Loans must be repaid; investments can be lost. All loans have an agreement and a repayment schedule, sometimes called a promissory note. When someone invests in a business, they understand that it is a risk and they may lose their money or never see any profit from the investment. If your business that was loaned money fails, you still must repay the business loan and all associated interest. For regulatory reasons, loans are the ONLY financial tools available in Weemba at this time. Under no circumstances can repayment plans for projects include a share in a business or other ownership.<br />

Still, Tengo's reading of the story was his and his alone. He could not help feeling a certain sympathy for the trusting men and women who were &quot;left in a pool of mysterious question marks&quot; after reading Air Chrysalis. He pictured a bunch of dismayed-looking people clutching at colorful flotation rings as they drifted aimlessly in a large pool full of question marks. In the sky above them shone an utterly unrealistic sun. Tengo felt a certain sense of responsibility for having foisted such a state of affairs upon the public. But who can possibly save all the people of the world? Tengo thought. You could bring all the gods of the world into one place, and still they couldn't abolish nuclear weapons or eradicate terrorism. They couldn't end the drought in Africa or bring John Lennon back to life. Far from it -- the gods would just break into factions and start fighting among themsevles, and the world would probably become even more chaotic than it is now. Considering the sense of powerlessness that such a state of affairs would bring about, to have people floating in a pool of mysterious question marks seems like a minor sin.<br />

<strong>representative movements worked in the ‘60s because the dominant form was the centralized nation-state authority that relied on controlling subjects through exclusion. Their social change theory is out of date – the new transnational aggregates of sovereignty rely on breaking down borders in order to create a smooth space for control so that the body may be re-enslaved under the illusion of its own desire, coopting their movement into simply another identitarian brand name vying for air time on the neoliberal television that invariably changes the channel</strong><br />

Modern national sovereignty's major concern was the assignment of rights in order to sustain the national compromise between competing <u>[[#|social classes]]</u> and strata of society. Representation was a minor concern, always present and active but still minor (i.e. representation was principally conceived as the ways in which different social classes are interpellated by state apparatuses and are codified in the cultural imaginary). In the double-R axiom of national sovereignty rights were more central than representation. But neoliberalism changed this: the dismantling of social welfare systems and the rapidly rising levels of mobility on the part of post- Fordist labour led to an increasing diversification of social strata and classes. And this diversification brought with it the politics of difference. In other words, the cultural politics of neoliberalism has been postmodernism: the fight for representation. Cultural studies, feminism, postcolonial studies, queer politics have all participated in and critiqued this fight for representation (Hall and Jefferson, 1976; Clifford, 1986; Sedgwick, 1990; Spivak, 1999; Warner, 1999b; Butler, Laclau and Zizek, 2000; Mouffe, 2000). But what is this fight for representation, where does it come from? First of all, it stems from the dissolution of social class as the central actor in society. The different levels in Piranesi's etching seem to represent interconnected but contained social classes. This is not the case for the columns in Libeskind's Garden of Exile. Rather, the 49 columns appear as different social groups on a small scale, more akin to emerging subjectivities than to hierarchically organised classes. The political order of transnational sovereignty is an order with multiple players working to foster alliances between themselves and to establish new relations of power. And it is precisely this form of relationality which triggers the imperative for representation. Rep­resentation enters the realm of politics as the attempt to give voice and operative agency to social groups who have been excluded in the national social compromise's distribution of rights. After the Second World War, social actors focused more on matters of representation than on rights. This is the moment when hitherto imperceptible subjectivities emerge on the political scene and threaten to disrupt national sovereign power, which functions through a centralised allocation of rights. We can trace the singular trajectories of these sub­jectivities in civil rights movements, in the events of '68, in feminist movements, anti-work movements and new forms of cooperation, in the 1960s cultural rebellions and fights against colonialism. By the 1960s, the wild anomaly of the escaping and refusing mobs once again spreads through society and disseminates into the world (Connery, 2005). This is the moment when imperceptible politics coalesces as an escape from national sovereignty. The Intimacy of Power New social subjectivities and new social actors now emerge as a productive force, an immanent force which the modern nation state can no longer negate; national sovereignty is challenged. But this challenge, in turn, triggers its own response. Neoliberalism is not primarily the answer to the quest for a new mode of economic regulation (Aglietta, 1979). Nor does it primarily address demands for a new relation between culture and production (Jameson, 1991) or between market and society (Barry, Osborne and Rose, 1996; Donzelot, 1984). Neoliberalism is the answer to the wild insurgency and escape which emerges after the Second World War. Transnational neoliberal sovereignty only emerges in response to the necessity to tame the reappearance of imperceptible and escaping subjectivities in the post-Second World War period. It attempts to reabsorb the potentials of actors made evident in the 1960s and 1970s. This capture transforms what national sovereignty neglects, now the wild anomaly of the new social subjectivities is channelled into those of docile, productive actors in globalised, transnational neoliberal networks of power. There are neither historical laws nor inherent necessities of other kinds determining the emergence of transnational neoliberal sovereignty; there is only the necessity to tame the imperceptible and escaping subjectivities of the post-Second World War period. The forms of domestication imposed on these subjectivities by modern sovereignty become constraining and even obsolete. Transnational sovereignty functions without starting from a transcendent viewpoint, that is without being able to adopt a perspective from which society can be seen as a whole and without managing to impose a centralised form of regulation on the different social actors involved. Luhmann's (1995) vision of 'non-society' is the most brilliant and apt description of the workings and intricate relationalities dwelling in the social worlds emerging in transnational sovereignty. Instead of disrupting and negating the intimate affection between these new escaping subjectivities and their potentials, transnational sovereignty understands this intimate relation as the immanent, driving force of social life. Transnational sovereignty accepts and does not try to suppress the challenge of insurgent and escaping actors which emerged in the post-war period. Rather than negating the potentials of these subjectivities and imposing a transcendent relation between subjectivity and power, transnational sovereignty turns the intrinsic affection between subjectivity and its potentials into its core functioning principle. In the moment at which the intimacy of subjectivity and its potentials is installed at the heart of sovereignty, sovereignty itself becomes intimate. And of course, what emerges is an intimate form of power. We have here a new form of working with the body's potentialities. Modern sovereignty negates disruptive trajectories and the body's remaining potentials are absorbed into the grand corpus of society (the nation and the big Leviathan). Modern national sovereignty installs a hierarchical, transcendent relation between body and polity. In contrast, transnational sovereignty generalises the intrinsic relation between body, potential and power into the paramount principle according to which society functions. The body's potentials are redoubled and incorporated - not as the object of power - but as the very means through which transnational sovereignty operates. Singularity, potentiality are affirmed as necessary for participation in this flexible regime of control. Transnational sovereignty is decentralised and contagious. The redoubling of the body's potentials in transnational sovereignty means that the body itself takes on its own control. Control is not constructed as a transcendent relation between power and the body but is internalised in the very existence of the body itself (Deleuze, 1992). Transnational sovereignty no longer attempts to regulate the connections between the triptych of people, nation and state territory, rather it abandons the notion that there must be one persistent and prevalent mode of ordering this triptych. In place of any primary organising principle, now organisation arises out of subjectivities as autopoeitic systems and out of the relationality of self-activating bodies (Luhmann, 1985). The self-activating body appears in different guises - the self-organising agent, the robot, the cyborg, the embodied mind, embodied feelings (Varela, Thompson and Rosch, 1991; Haraway, 1991b; Brooks, 2002; Clark, 1997; Damasio, 1999; De Landa, 2002).<br />

Whatever angle you look at it from, there's no escape from the present. That's not the least of its virtues. For those who want absolutely to have hope, it knocks down every support. Those who claim to have solutions are proven wrong almost immediately. It's understood that now everything can only go from bad to worse. &quot;There's no future for the future&quot; is the wisdom behind an era that for all its appearances of extreme normalcy has come to have about the consciousness level of the first punks. The sphere of political representation is closed. From left to right, it's the same nothingness acting by turns either as the big shots or the virgins, the same sales shelf heads, changing up their discourse according to the latest dispatches from the information service. Those who still vote give one the impression that their only intention is to knock out the polling booths by voting as a pure act of protest. And we've started to understand that in fact it’s only against the vote itself that people go on voting. Nothing we've seen can come up to the heights of the present situation; not by far. By its very silence, the populace seems infinitely more 'grown up' than all those squabbling amongst themselves to govern it do. Any Belleville chibani 1 is wiser in his chats than in all of those puppets’ grand declarations put together. The lid of the social kettle is triple-tight, and the pressure inside won’t stop building. The ghost of Argentina’s Que Se Vayan Todos 2 is seriously starting to haunt the ruling heads. The fires of November 2005 will never cease to cast their shadow on all consciences. Those first joyous fires were the baptism of a whole decade full of promises. The media’s “suburbs vs. the Republic” myth, if it’s not inefficient, is certainly not true. The fatherland was ablaze all the way to downtown everywhere, with fires that were methodically snuffed out. Whole streets went up in flames of solidarity in Barcelona and no one but the people who lived there even found out about it. And the country hasn’t stopped burning since. Among the accused we find diverse profiles, without much in common besides a hatred for existing society; not united by class, race, or even by neighborhood. What was new wasn’t the “suburban revolt,” since that was already happening in the 80s, but the rupture with its established forms. The assailants weren’t listening to anybody at all anymore, not their big brothers, not the local associations assigned to help return things to normal. No “SOS Racism which only fatigue, falsification, and media omertà 4 could feign putting an end. The whole series of nocturnal strikes, anonymous attacks, wordless destruction, had the merit of busting wide open the split between politics and the political. No one can honestly deny the obvious weight of this assault which made no demands, and had no message other than a threat which had nothing to do with politics. But you’d have to be blind not to see what is purely political about this resolute negation of politics, and you’d certainly have to know absolutely nothing about the autonomous youth movements of the last 30 years. Like abandoned children we burned the first baby toys of a society that deserves no more respect than the monuments of Paris did at the end of Bloody Week 5 -- and knows it. There’s no social solution to the present situation. First off because the vague aggregate of social groupings, institutions, and individual bubbles that we designate by the anti-phrase “society” has no substance, because there’s no language left to express common experiences with. It took a half-century of fighting by the Lumières to thaw out the possibility of a French Revolution, and a century of fighting by work to give birth to the fearful “Welfare State.” Struggles creating the language in which the new order expresses itself. Nothing like today. Europe is now a de-monied continent that sneaks off to make a run to the Lidl 6 and has to fly with the low-cost airlines to be able to keep on flying. None of the “problems” formulated in the social language are resolvable. The “retirement pensions issue,” the issues of “precariousness,” the “youth” and their “violence” can only be kept in suspense as long as the ever more surprising “acting out” they thinly cover gets managed away police-like. No one’s going to be happy to see old people being wiped out at a knockdown price, abandoned by their own and with nothing to say. And those who’ve found less humiliation and more benefit in a life of crime than in sweeping floors will not give up their weapons, and prison won’t make them love society. The rage to enjoy of the hordes of the retired will not take the somber cuts to their monthly income on an empty stomach, and will get only too excited about the refusal to work among a large sector of the youth. And to conclude, no guaranteed income granted the day after a quasi-uprising will lay the foundations for a new New Deal, a new pact, and a new peace. The social sentiment is rather too evaporated for all that. As their solution, they’ll just never stop putting on the pressure, to make sure nothing happens, and with it we’ll have more and more police chases all over the neighborhood. The drone that even according to the police indeed did fly over Seine-Saint-Denis 7 last July 14 th is a picture of the future in much more straightforward colors than all the hazy images we get from the humanists. That they took the time to clarify that it was not armed shows pretty clearly the kind of road we’re headed down. The country is going to be cut up into ever more air-tight zones. Highways built along the border of the “sensitive neighborhoods” already form walls that are invisible and yet able to cut them off from the private subdivisions. Whatever good patriotic souls may think about it, the management of neighborhoods “by community” is most effective just by its notoriety. The purely metropolitan portions of the country, the main downtowns, lead their luxurious lives in an ever more calculating, ever more sophisticated, ever more shimmering deconstruction. They light up the whole planet with their whorehouse red lights, while the BAC 8 and the private security companies’ -- read: militias’ -- patrols multiply infinitely, all the while benefiting from being able to hide behind an ever more disrespectful judicial front. The catch-22 of the present, though perceptible everywhere, is denied everywhere. Never have so many psychologists, sociologists, and literary people devoted themselves to it, each with their own special jargon, and each with their own specially missing solution. It’s enough just to listen to the songs that come out these days, the trifling “new French music,” where the petty-bourgeoisie dissects the states of its soul and the K’1Fry mafia 9 makes its declarations of war, to know that this coexistence will come to an end soon and that a decision is about to be made. This book is signed in the name of an imaginary collective. Its editors are not its authors. They are merely content to do a little clean-up of what’s scattered around the era’s common areas, around the murmurings at bar-tables, behind closed bedroom doors. They’ve only determined a few necessary truths, whose universal repression fills up the psychiatric hospitals and the painful gazes. They’ve made themselves scribes of the situation. It’s the privilege of radical circumstances that justice leads them quite logically to revolution. It’s enough just to say what we can see and not avoid the conclusions to be drawn from it.<br />

The world has already ended, we just don’t know it yet. What can this statement mean? By stating this, I do not mean that the earth, universe, whatever we want to call “everything that exists (Spinoza’s “God”?) or even immanence itself has radically and literally come to an end, nor do I mean that we are on the verge of imminent apocalypse. What I do mean by this statement, what I hope to capture with this formulation, is the affect (or subjective experience)7 of a life lived in a “state of exception” that has become the norm. In this sense, it is meant to point to the proliferation of the radical separation accomplished in the exception. The “taking of the outside”8 accomplished in the exception is a radical separation of our bodies from themselves, from immanence—the outside, the “world”—as a non-essential, exterior foundation for politics, thought, and subjectivity. In this sense, this statement is meant to point to the despair of a life lived in separation from itself—from, even, its own encounters, relations, and exposures. Life in the state of exception is that which everywhere remains profoundly separated from itself. Life divided from life. A life that is perpetually emptied out, reduced to the brutal fact of mere survival (naked life)—the biopolitical production of life as mere survival.9 What remains of the world in the exception? Insofar as the time of and for the world (the outside) has grown short—insofar as the post-war era is marked by a state of perpetual suspension, a radical deferral and delay of the potential of subjectivity, thought, and politics—we can read this situation as the beginning of the end of time; of and for the political, of and for thought, of and for life. Within the closure of the outside that marks the exception, the time for any potential politics has grown short. There is little time left for the political—that is, before any hope of a politics becomes permanently suspended. Time is running out. The time that is left, the time that remains for life, for politics, for thought, has become contracted. This is the problem of messianic time. According to Agamben, Benjamin was the first to grasp the link between the state of exception and the messianic event in Jewish mysticism; that is, between the status of the law in the “state of exception” and the confrontation with the law marked by the arrival of the Messiah. The arrival of the Messiah does not, as is commonly thought, mark the end of time. It is not, as it has been assumed in many interpretations of Benjamin’s “Theses,” the time of the apocalypse, or the Last Days, but rather a time marked by the suspension of the Law.10 With the arrival of the Messiah, “the hidden foundation of the law [as being in force without significance] comes to light, and the law itself enters into a state of perpetual suspension.”11 The arrival of the Messiah inaugurates a radical suspension of the Law. Messianism is, according to Agamben, “a theory of the state of exception—except for the fact that in Messianism there is no authority in force to proclaim the state of exception; instead, there is the Messiah to subvert its power.”12 In the Jewish tradition, this is the time of the messianic event. Between the time of the creation, which includes the time of the end of the world, and the time after the end of the world, there is the time of the Messiah.13 This time is a remnant—it is the (non-relational) time that remains in the disjunction between two traditional concepts of time (historical or chronological time, and a “future” time after the end of the world).14 Messianic time, then, is an “immanent time. A time within time.”15 What is truly historical is not what redeems time in the direction of the future, or even the past; it is rather what fulfills time in the excess of a medium. The messianic Kingdom is neither the future (the millennium) nor the past (the golden age): it is, instead, a remaining time.16 “Messianism,” as Agamben makes clear, “is not the end of time, but the time of the end.”17 It is the time that is left. What can it mean, Agamben asks throughout Il tempo che resta, to think this remnant of time? Following Agamben, I would like to ask how this contraction of time that marks our present relates to our ability to think and experience something called the world? What can it mean to think the world as that which has already ended, without our being able to say why or, even that we fully know that this event has happened? It is in this image of the end of the world, I think, that the “now of recognizability &lt;Jetz der Erkennbarkeit&gt;”18 of the potential of the world (the outside) and its radical destruction and separation in the exception comes to us. How can we think—when thought itself, according to Deleuze, is based on an exteriority without reserve—in a situation that implies and enforces a radical separation from experience, one that would “take” any, potentially every, encounter with the outside? How, in the “taking of the outside” of the exception, is radical exteriority possible? And how, following Deleuze’s singular individuation, can thought be based on our unique experiences, encounters and relations—all of which “happen” in a space of radical exteriority, in the world— when it is precisely the “taking” of this that is accomplished in the exception? All of this is to ask, how can we think exposure in the exception?19 I am employing the term “world” here in the sense that Nietzsche uses it in his thought of the eternal return which, among much else, is also a theory of the world.20 For Nietzsche, the “world” is the abyss in which subjectivity and exteriority coincide in the exact same moment—a moment that is grasped, or should we say expressed and performed, in the ethical stance of the return: the willing of the eternal return of all that exists (the abyss), and the affirmation of chance and chaos. Deleuze’s statement regarding the loss of the “world” cited above refers, I think, to this conception of the world. In the speculations that follow, I want to delimit my inquiry to this aspect of the return—as an abyssal theory of the world in which subjectivity and exteriority coincide in the same moment (within the abyss). Such delimitation allows us to simultaneously blur the distinction between the ethical and epistemological thought of the return without, at the same time, completely abandoning every aspect of the latter (which seems both unnecessary and undesirable). In this delimited sense, my statement about the end of the world means two things. In the first place, it means the loss of the concept of an abyssal encounter with the world (as an existential-ontological and epistemological foundation) contained explicitly in Nietzsche’s “eternal return.” In other words, the “end of the world” as the experience of the exception means the end of the eternal return, of any truly abyssal thought as the basis for thinking exteriority and subjectivity (I will explain this in more detail below).21 Secondly, my statement is a play on the idea that without such a thought (which has influenced much, if not all, post-war thought on exteriority), we cannot think; it is the end of the world for thought, politics, and subjectivity. In other words, this statement points to the reaction to the thought of the exception and the problems it exposes, the unnecessary fear, I think, with which it has been met by theorists of radical exteriority. The separation from the outside (which is also, to say, from our “selves”) accomplished in the exception means that our ability to have a relation to the world, to make use of its potential—for thought, for life, for politics—has become permanently “policed” in the post-war era. The exception constitutes what Agamben calls a “prior movement”22 not only for our lives, but also for any corresponding theory of exposure, affect, and “becoming.”23 The exception, in other words, may precede our ways of thinking about both subjectivity and exteriority. What can it mean to say that the world and our relation to it have become suspended? Any effort to affirm our lives today as exposure and vulnerability—as the encounter of an abyssal body with an abyssal world— runs up against this limit of a “world” that, defined in this sense, has effectively ended.<br />

VP Since it happened a long time before I started to write, there’s no way to determine how it affected my writing. However, the effect of this book was really fantastic. There’s an expression “out of this world.” This book was totally out of the Soviet world. The evil magic of any totalitarian regime is based on its presumed capability to embrace and explain all the phenomena, their entire totality, because explanation is control. Hence the term totalitarian. So if there’s a book that takes you out of this totality of things explained and understood, it liberates you because it breaks the continuity of explanation and thus dispels the charms. It allows you to look in a different direction for a moment, but this moment is enough to understand that everything you saw before was a hallucination (though what you see in this different direction might well be another hallucination). The Master and Margarita was exactly this kind of book and it is very hard to explain its subtle effect to anybody who didn’t live in the USSR. Solzhenitsyn’s books were very anti-Soviet, but they didn’t liberate you, they only made you more enslaved as they explained to which degree you were a slave. The Master and Margarita didn’t even bother to be anti-Soviet yet reading this book would make you free instantly. It didn’t liberate you from some particular old ideas, but rather from the hypnotism of the entire order of things. LK What books have you most enjoyed reading in the last few years? In particular I wonder if there are any American authors among your recent favorites. VP I can’t say I read too much fiction. I liked Pastoralia and CivilWarLand in Bad Decline by George Saunders, but his best story I read so far was “I Can Speak!™” published in The New Yorker. I liked some stories by David Foster Wallace and plan to siege his Infinite Jest one infinite day. Talking of the old guard, I like Robert M. Pirsig. The real heroes in his books are concepts rather than humans, and they change and develop like characters do in more traditional novels: this is incredible. LK The ghost of Che Guevara appears in your most recent book, Homo Zapiens, propounding a theory of television as either (1) switched off, in which case it is like any other object, i.e., not any more or less difficult for the unquiet mind to pay attention to than, say, a rock, or (2) switched on, in which case it guides the attention of the viewer to such an extent that he becomes “possessed,” “techno-modified,” “a virtual subject” and no longer himself. In August of 2000, the Ostankino TV tower in Moscow caught fire, interrupting broadcasts for several days and rendering all television sets as objects of type (1). Was there a perceptible change of mood among Moscow citizens at that time? VP I think so. People were getting nervous and irritated, like drug addicts without a routine injection. But there were a lot of jokes about it nevertheless. As for me, I hadn’t been watching television for a long time by that moment, so I didn’t experience any personal problems. LK A big change over the last decade has been the decline in the influence of Russia’s military, which was called upon to fight a difficult war in Chechnya even as morale was falling and resources available to it were shrinking. Your father, who I understand passed away several years ago, was himself in the military. How did he view this decline in influence? VP My father was a rather strange Soviet military man, and never had any particular influence as such. He wasn’t even a party member, which made him kind of a white crow and impeded his career badly. It wasn’t his choice to join the military: the Soviet Union started its missile program when he was a student in Kiev, and many students from technical institutes were drafted to serve in this new branch of armed force as officers. Your consent wasn’t necessary for this at that time. I never had access to the inner workings of my father’s soul but I think he never totally identified himself with the Red Army’s military might, though he was a good specialist. At the time of the decline he was much more concerned with his own health, which was deteriorating quickly. But I think that, like many people who spent their entire lifetime in the USSR, he was too stunned by its demise to take any ensuing events seriously. LK In Homo Zapiens, the Russian government is portrayed as “virtual”: three-dimensional dummies on TV whose movements are scripted by screenwriters. This device seems particularly apt in describing the Yeltsin government, held together as it was with television coverage, funding from tycoons and the IMF, multiple heart bypasses and so forth. Do you believe it has become any less apt now, under the leadership of Putin? VP Phenomenologically any politician is a TV program, and this doesn’t change from one government to another. But if you want me to compare the government we had under Yeltsin with the one we have under Putin, I won’t be able to do it. Not only because I don’t watch television. For this kind of assessment you need a criterion. I guess the right one would be the way the government handles the economy, because its primary function is to take care of the economy. Politics is usually the function of the latter. To pass a judgment here you need to understand, even approximately, how the economy works. In the Western economy you have a set of instruments that allow you to make this assessment even if you are not a specialist. It is always clear whether it is a bull market or bear market. So you can say: bull market, good government, bear market, bad government (I know it is an oversimplification, but still). But these instruments are not applicable to the Russian economy because its very nature is different. The essence of your business cycle here in Russia is that you always have a pig market, which means that you don’t get whacked as long as you pay the pigs. And sometimes you get whacked even if you pay because it is a real pig market. Russian economy is the dimension where miracle meets subpoena and becomes state secret. How do you compare the numerous different governments that preside over this? The only criterion would be personal appeal of the ministers: a goatee fashion, a necktie color, et cetera. But for this you have to watch television. LK Reading philosophy is in some ways a disease, like alcohol or drugs or dog racing or any other addiction. I wonder what Western philosophers you have found most compelling. In particular I wonder if, like the moth Mitya in The Life of Insects, you have a particular affinity for Marcus Aurelius. Here I think of the Marcus Aurelius who insists upon an inner self that can’t be, except by its own assent, corrupted by the outer world. This seems to be a recurring theme in your works: the primacy of the individual mind in the face of a dangerous external world, whether the Soviet one or that of post-Soviet wild capitalism. VP If we put it your way, the most compelling Western philosophers in my life were Remy Martin and Jack Daniels. They compelled me to do many things I otherwise would never think of. If seriously, I don’t take professional philosophers seriously even when I understand what they say. Philosophy is a self-propelled thinking, and thinking, no matter how refined, only leads to further thinking. Uncoerced thinking gives us the best it can when it subsides down and halts, because it is the source of nearly all our problems. As far as I’m concerned, thoughts are justified in two cases: when they swiftly make us rich and when they fascinate us with their beauty. Philosophy could sometimes fit into the first category—for instance, if you write “The Philosophy That Burns Fat” or something like “The Philosophy of Swimming with Sharks without Being Eaten”—but it would be an exception. Sometimes philosophy fits into the second category (also an exception), and Marcus Aurelius is exactly the case. I read his book many times when I was a kid but I’m not sure I understood his philosophy—I was simply captivated by the noble beauty of his spirit. By the way, I read somewhere that Bill Clinton’s favorite quote came from Marcus Aurelius: “One could lead a decent life even in a palace.” The very notion of Western philosophy as opposed to Eastern seems to me quite dubious and arbitrary, though Bertrand Russell wrote a very good book on its history. This label implies that your mind starts to generalize in a different manner when it is placed in a different geographical location. But how would you classify Aldous Huxley’s Perennial Philosophy — as Eastern or Western? As for the self, it is a very tricky notion. We should define it before we use it. I prefer the term mind. I think you are absolutely right when you say that my theme is the primacy of the mind. But the external world is also your mind because the categories external and internal are purely mental. Mind is the ultimate paradox because when you start to look for it you can’t find it. But when you start to look for something that is not mind you also can’t find it. Mind is the central issue that interests me as a writer and as a person.<br />

When Spinoza says 'The surprising thing is the body ... we do not yet know what a body is capable of ... ', he does not want to make the body a model, and the soul simply de­pendent on the body. He has a subtler task. He wants to demolish the pseudo-superiority of the soul over the body. There is the soul and the body and both express one and the same thing: an attribute of the body is also an expressed of the soul (for example, speed). Just as you do not know what a body is capable of, just as there are many things in the body that you do not know, so there are in the soul many things which go beyond your consciousness. This is the question: what is a body capable of? what affects are you capable of? Experiment, but you need a lot of prudence to experiment. We live in a world which is generally disagreeable, where not only people but the established powers have a stake in transmitting sad affects to us. Sadness, sad affects, are all those which reduce our power to act. The established powers need our sadness to make us slaves. The tyrant, the priest, the captors of souls need to persuade us that life is hard and a burden. The powers that be need to repress us no less than to make us anxious or, as Virilio says, to administer and organize our intimate little fears. The long, universal moan about life: the lack-to-be which is life ... In vain someone says, 'Let's dance'; we are not really very happy. In vain someone says, ‘What misfortune death is'; for one would need to have lived to have something to lose. Those who are sick, in soul as in body, will not let go of us, the vampires, until they have transmitted to us their neurosis and their anxiety, their beloved castration, the resentment against life, filthy contagion. It is all a matter of blood. It is not easy to be a free man, to flee the plague, organize encounters, increase the power to act, to be moved by joy, to multiply the affects which express or encompass a maximum of affirmation. To make the body a power which is not reducible to the organism, to make thought a power which is not reducible to consciousness. Spinoza’s famous first principle (a single substance for all attributes) depends on this assemblage and not vice versa. There is a Spinoza-assemblage: soul and body, relationships and encounters, power to be affected, affects which realize this power, sadness and joy which qualify these affects. Here philosophy becomes the art of a functioning, of an assemblage. Spinoza, the man of encounters and becoming, the philosopher with the tick, Spinoza the imperceptible, always in the middle, always in flight although he does not shift much, a flight from the Jewish community, a flight from Powers, a flight from the sick and the malignant. He may be ill, he may himself die; he knows that death is neither the goal nor the end, but that, on the contrary, it is a case of passing his life to someone else. What Lawrence says about Whitman’s continuous life is well suited to Spinoza: the Soul and the Body, the soul is neither above nor inside, it is ‘with’, it is on the road, exposed to all contacts, encounters, in the company of those who follow the same way, ‘feel with them, seize the vibration of their soul and their body as they pass’, the opposite of a morality of salvation, teaching to soul its life, not to save it.<br />

<strong>Ours is not a critique of their goal but rather of their methodological framing of “fantasy documents” as a “rupture” in violence. It is this attempt to locate an origin to violence, creating a final avatar of Power to oppose that has made many of the masses kill in the name of their servitude and drives many systems of domination. Their attempt to <u>locate</u> a center to violence is <u>precisely</u> the enabling condition for oppression, as it scripts the possibilities for resistance in advance. Our challenge to their description <u>is</u> our alternative. Before establishing the desirability of their policy, we must first understand how they act upon the edifices of Power which they claim to change. Our politicization of thought itself is necessary to a <u>truly</u> liberatory politics of <u>conceptual mobility</u></strong><br />

How does one &quot;act&quot; on something, and what is the act or actuality of this potential? The act is reason. Notice that reason is not a faculty but a process, which consists precisely in actualizing a potential or giving form to matter. Reason is itself a pluralism, because nothing indicates that we should think of matter or the act as unique. We define or invent a process of rationalization each time we establish human relations in some material form, in some group, in some multiplicity.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/opera_quarterly/v021/21.4deleuze.html#FOOT4" rel="nofollow">4</a> The act itself, qua relation, is always political. Reason, as a process, is political. This may well be the case within a city, but it goes for other, smaller groups as well, or even for myself—and nowhere but in myself. Psychology, or rather the only bearable psychology, is politics, because I am forever creating human relationships with myself. There is no psychology, but rather a politics of the self. There is no metaphysics, but rather a politics of being. No science, but rather a politics of matter, since man is entrusted with matter itself. The same even applies to sickness: we have to &quot;manage&quot; it when we cannot conquer it, and thereby impose on it the form of human relationships. Consider the case of sonorous matter. The musical scale, or rather a musical scale, is a process of rationalization that consists in establishing human relationships via this matter in a manner that actualizes its potentiality and it itself becomes human. Marx analyzed the sense organs in this way in order to demonstrate through them the immanence of man and Nature: the ear becomes a human ear when the resonant object becomes musical. The very diverse group of processes of rationalization is what constitutes human becoming or activity, Praxis, or practices. We do not know in this regard if there is such a thing as a human unity, whether from the historical or the generic point of view. Is there a properly human matter, pure potential, distinct from actuality, that has the ability to fascinate us? There is nothing like &quot;freedom&quot; within us that does not also appear as its opposite: as something that &quot;imprisons&quot; us, as Châtelet is always saying. It would be quite obtuse of potentiality to oppose the act capable of realizing it—an inversion of reason, more than its opposite, a privation or alienation. It is as if there were a nonhuman relationship that nevertheless was internal or immanent to human relations, an inhumanity specific to humans: freedom that becomes the capacity of man to vanquish man, or to be vanquished. Potentiality is pathos, which is to say passivity or receptivity, but receptivity is first and foremost the power to receive blows and to give them: a strange kind of endurance. To be sure, one can draw up the history of systems of domination, in which the activity of the powerful is at work; but this activity is nothing without the appetite of those who aspire to give blows in the name of the blows they have received. They fight for their servitude as if it were their freedom, as Spinoza put it. Thus, whether exercised or endured, power is not merely the activity of man's social existence; it is also the passivity of man's natural existence. There is a unity of war [End Page 717] and land, the traces of which Châtelet detected in the work of Claude Simon—or in Marxism, which never separated the active existence of man as a historical being from its &quot;double,&quot; the passive existence of man as a natural being: Reason and its irrationality: this was Marx's own theme, [and] it is also ours. . . . He wants to produce a critical science of the actual, fundamental passivity of humanity. Man does not die because he is mortal (any more than he lies because he is a &quot;liar,&quot; or loves because he is a &quot;lover&quot;): he dies because he does not eat enough, because he is reduced to the state of bestiality, because he is killed. Historical materialism is there to remind us of these facts, and Marx, in Capital, lays the foundations for what might be a method enabling us to analyze, for a given period—quite a revealing period, in fact—the mechanisms at work in the fact of passivity. . . .<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/opera_quarterly/v021/21.4deleuze.html#FOOT5" rel="nofollow">5</a> Aren't there values specific to pathos? Maybe in the form of a despair about the world, something which is quite present in Châtelet, underneath his extreme politeness. If human beings are constantly in a process of mutual demolition, we might as well destroy ourselves, under pleasant, even fanciful conditions. &quot;Of course all life is a process of breaking down,&quot; as Fitzgerald said.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/opera_quarterly/v021/21.4deleuze.html#FOOT6" rel="nofollow">6</a> This &quot;of course&quot; has the ring of a verdict of immanence: the inhuman element in one's relationship to oneself. Châtelet's only novel, Les années de démolition (The Demolition Years), has a profoundly Fitzgeraldian motif, an elegance in the midst of disaster. It is not a question of dying, or of a desire to die, but of investing the temptation to die in a sublime element like music. Once again, this has less to do with psychoanalysis than with politics. We must take account of this vector of destruction, which can traverse a community or a man, Athens or Pericles. Périclès was Châtelet's first book.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/opera_quarterly/v021/21.4deleuze.html#FOOT7" rel="nofollow">7</a> Pericles was always the very image of the great man, or great hero, for Châtelet—even in Pericles's &quot;passivity,&quot; even in his failure (which was also the failure of democracy), even in spite of his disturbing trajectory [vecteur ]. Another value proper to pathos is politeness—a Greek politeness, in fact, which already contains an outline of human relationships, the beginnings of an act of reason. Human relationships begin with a reasoned system, an organization of space that undergirds a city. An art of establishing the right distances between humans, not hierarchically but geometrically, neither too far nor too close, to ensure that blows will not be given or received. To make human encounters into a rite, a kind of ritual of immanence, even if this requires a bit of schizophrenia. What the Greeks taught us, and [Louis] Gernet or [Jean-Pierre] Vernant reminded us, is to not let ourselves be nailed down to a fixed center, but to acquire the capacity to transport a center along with oneself, in order to organize sets of symmetrical, reversible relations established by free men. This may not be enough to defeat the despair of the world, for there are fewer and fewer polite men, and there must be at least two for the quality itself to exist. But François Châtelet's [End Page 718] extreme politeness was also a mask concealing a third value of pathos: what one might term goodness, a warm benevolence. The term is not quite right, even though this quality, this value, was deeply present in Châtelet. More than a quality or a value, it is a disposition of thought, an act of thinking. It consists in this: not knowing in advance how someone might yet be able to establish a process of rationalization, both within and outside himself. Of course there are all the lost causes, the despair. But if there is a chance [at establishing a process of rationalization], what does that someone need, how does he escape his own destruction? All of us, perhaps, are born on terrain favorable to demolition, but we will not miss a chance. There is no pure reason or rationality par excellence. There are processes of rationalization—heterogeneous and varied, depending on conditions, eras, groups, and individuals. These are constantly being aborted, receding, and reaching dead ends, and yet resuming elsewhere, with new measures, new rhythms, new allures. The inherent plurality of processes of rationalization is already the object of classic epistemological analyses (Koyré, Bachelard, Canguilhem), and sociopolitical analyses (Max Weber). In his late works, Foucault too pushed this pluralism toward an analysis of human relationships, which would constitute the first steps toward a new ethics from the standpoint of what he called &quot;processes of subjectification&quot;: Foucault's analysis emphasized bifurcations and derivations, the broken historicity of reason, which is always in a state of liberation or alienation as it equates to man's relationship to himself. Foucault had to go back as far as the Greeks, not in order to find the miracle of reason par excellence, but merely in order to diagnose what was perhaps the first gesture toward a process of rationalization, and one that would be followed by many others, in different conditions, under different guises. Foucault no longer characterized the Greek polis in terms of the organization of a new space, but as a human relation that could take the form of a rivalry between free men or citizens (in politics, but also in love, gymnastics, or justice . . . ). Within this sort of process of rationalization and subjectification, a free man could not govern other free men, in principle, unless he were capable of governing himself. This is the specifically Greek act or process, which cannot be treated as a foundational act but rather as a singular event in a broken chain. It is undoubtedly here that Châtelet, having taken the Greek polis as his point of departure, meets Foucault. Châtelet defines the Greek polis with reference to the magistrate—not only in terms of how he differs from other functionaries, such as the priest or the imperial civil servant, but also with respect to his correlative duties, which belong to a corresponding process of rationalization (for instance, the drawing of lots). No one has analyzed how the process of drawing lots captures the gist of reason better than Châtelet. For Châtelet, rationalization is also a historical and political [End Page 719] process, in which Athens is its key event yet is also its failure and its erasure—namely, Pericles, from which other events spin off and are absorbed into other processes. Athens was not the advent of an eternal reason, but the singular event of a provisional rationalization, and is as such all the more striking. When we posit a single, universal reason de jure, we are falling precisely into what Châtelet calls presumption—a kind of metaphysical rudeness. He diagnoses this ailment in Plato: even when we recognize that reason is a human, solely human, faculty, a faculty tailored to human ends, we nevertheless continue to grant it theological transcendence. We draw up a dualism of processes instead of a pluralism of processes; this dualism opposes discourse to violence, as if violence were not already concealed within discourse itself, providing it with its various impetuses and ins and outs. For a long time, under the influence of Eric Weil<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/opera_quarterly/v021/21.4deleuze.html#FOOT8" rel="nofollow">8</a> and according to a Platonic and Hegelian model, Châtelet believed in the opposition between violence and discourse. But what he discovers, on the contrary, is the ability of discourse to give voice to man's distinct inhumanity. Indeed, it is the purview of discourse to engage the process of its own rationalization, but only in a certain becoming, and due to the pressure of certain motivations and events. This is of extreme importance in Châtelet's La naissance de l'histoire (The Birth of History)<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/opera_quarterly/v021/21.4deleuze.html#FOOT9" rel="nofollow">9</a> , because the image of discourse or Logos that he presents there is closer to Thucydides than to Plato or Hegel. Indeed, he never ceases challenging the two corollaries of a doctrine of universal reason: first, the utopian need to invoke an ideal city or a universal State of right, which would prevent against a democratic future; second, the apocalyptic impetus to locate the moment, the fundamental alienation of reason that occurred once and for all, comprising in one stroke all violence and inhumanity. It is one and the same presumption that grants transcendence to both reason and to reason's corruption, and, since Plato, renders the one the twin of the other.<br />

If I wake up in the morning and think &quot;oh, today has begun,&quot; it's like thinking, &quot;life has begun&quot;. Of course, we fabricate threads of continuity, we think, I will continue to see you, or you will continue to see him. This is the burden and absurdity of life. I think life itself is pretty absurd. Perhaps yesterday or tomorrow doesn't exist, or perhaps I won't wake up again; I find these propositions to be more believable. Likewise, I think the future exists in the here and now. To be honest I am quite afraid of the future; I don't like making appointments for the next week. I like to live momentarily, in the present, because I have no way of feeling the future. Take the changing afternoon light which we admire right now; how it will change tomorrow isn't too important.<br />

<br />
Once we accept that actually existing non-statist societies are organized societies rather than reversions to, or remnants of, a nasty and brutish ‘state of nature’, we can begin to see that their traditions offer alternatives to the hegemony of hegemony. This theme will be developed further in the following chapter, but for now I want to note that whereas the argument that war is the most potent antidote to the formation of states seems to lead to a brand of right-libertarianism at best, or to the status quo capitalist-patriarchal free-for-all at worst, this mode of warding off the state form involves indigenous/anarchafeminist values of community, care and mutual respect. But still the function of ‘war’ must remain, if by ‘war’ we mean the willingness, on the part of individuals and communities, to defend themselves rather than be captured. In a gesture reminiscent of the long-standing love/hate relationship between anarchist activists and ‘the people’, Deleuze and Guattari observe that ‘the State apparatus needs, at its summit as at its base, predisabled people, preexisting amputees, the still-born, the congenitally infi rm, the one-eyed and one-armed’ (426). The ableist language deployed here must be noted and critiqued, but the metaphorical resonances are clear and important: states require subjects who desire not only to repress others, but also desire their own repression, subjects who are willing to trade away their autonomy for the promise of security. Warding off the state, then, means primarily enabling and empowering individuals and communities; it means, as Landauer argued, rendering the state redundant, and watching very closely that it remains that way. Certainly the men and women of the state understand this requirement from the other side, as evidenced by their systematic attacks on non-statist societies via colonialism, and their incessant work, via secret police forces, the mass media, state schools and ‘social security’, to ensure that as many subjects as possible remain as dependent as possible; that we continue to beg for scraps of food, land, recognition and tolerance, to be allowed to ‘let live’. Although it is important to understand how the state form as such operates, it is impossible to analyse adequately actually existing states without paying attention to their longstanding interactions with other apparatuses. While it is a commonplace to suggest that nation-states are less important now than they were in some era ‘prior’ to capitalist globalization, it is clear that the state form and capital have grown up together, in a relationship that while it may be fraught with localized and short-term animosities, has been in the long term mutually beneficial. Following the same antievolutionary logic that underlies Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of the state form, capitalism—as an apparatus of exploitation—must also be seen as an ever-present potential, a way of being with others that is always possible, if we desire it—perhaps unconsciously—and must always be warded off if we do not. Just as the state and the war machine intermix, capitalism is in a perpetual fi eld of interaction with socialism, that is, with the idea that exploitation should be eliminated, or at least minimized. And we might say that racism, patriarchy, heterosexism, ableism, the domination of nature and any other discourse that carves up the social-natural fi eld into a hierarchy of identities, are apparatuses of division that undermine communitysolidarity and thereby facilitate capture-exploitation.<br />

The 1AC adaptation of transportation infrastructure is one side of the sovereign salvation coin that establishes those outside of the global North as sacrificial -- the role of social insurance programs in infrastructure codifies the existence of those without state-supported social insurance as &quot;disposable&quot; -- the 1AC makes unAmerican territory into another battlefield in a global civil war<br />

The 1ac is an 8 minute critique of corporatized transportation infrastructure, and their plan is to make this system more resilient to the climate change it caused – this is an incoherent double turn, as much as they will try to characterize solvency around their ‘interrogation’ and ‘reinvestment’ in reality they do <u>absolutely nothing</u>  to change the overall system their authors criticize and in fact only <u>grease the wheels</u> of corporate production by implementning a top down strategy which can be coopted and manipulated by corporate interetsts to fracture the possibility of autonomous resistance – that’s our goldstein evidence. Prefer our ev because its specific to climate adaptation transportation investment unlike the 1ac -- they have zero coherent response on a mechanism level which is game over because only a total challenge to neoliberal power relations can foster effective politics of climate adaptation<br />
