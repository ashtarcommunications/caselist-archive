 <strong>Plan Text: The United States federal government should substantially reduce all its military forces in South Korea</strong><br />
<br />
Contention 1: American Humanitarianism Empire<br />
<br />
<strong>US military presence in Korea rests on binary assumptions of “peace” and “war” that drive structural violence underground. The most insidious form is the unidirectional movement of transnational adoptees from Korea to the United States, “born” from poverty and colonialist conditions that are directly linked to military presence. Policymaking elites continue to assert that the absence of war creates peace while the bodies of Korean children are militarized, sexualized and transported around the world.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Duncan</span></span> 20<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">10</span></span></strong>, Patti, associate professor of women’s studies at Oregon State University, engaged in long-term research related to transnational feminism and militarism, “Geneaologies of Unbelonging: Amerasians and Transnational Adoptees as Legacies of U.S. Militarism in South Korea,” in Militarized Currents: Toward a Decolonized Future in Asia and the Pacific, Ed. Setsu SHigematsu, Keith L. Camacho, Cynthia Enloe, University of Minnesota Press<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;Which is better, Korea or America?&quot; a woman asks a group of children. They respond in unison, ''America! America!&quot; …..</span><br />
<span class="underline">that are subsequently stigmatized, abjected, or unilaterally transported (via adoption</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">) trans nationally. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>US military occupation of Korea produces the convergence of militarism and humanitarianism called “American humanitarianism empire.” This insidious form of American exceptionalism is born out of Cold War stories that obscure US neo-colonialism</strong><br />
<strong><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Soojin</span></span> 20<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">10</span></span></strong>, Pate, Ph.D candidate, “Genealogies of Korean Adoption: American Empire, Militarization, and Yellow Desire,” A dissertation submitted to the faculty of the graduate school of the University of Minnesota, May<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">If Korean adoption began as a solution to this postwar crisis, then why does it continue to exist</span>? …. <br />
<span class="underline">while, at the same time, invest in imperial activities overseas under the new geopolitics of the Cold War</span>. <br />
<br />
<strong>The transnational adoption network between Korea and the US is a product of US military presence that sustains a narrative of salvation that perpetuates colonialism, military intervention, racism, gender discrimination and other forms of violence that are “strategically” forgotten in order to sustain the worst forms of neoliberalism in the context of US/Korea relations.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Duncan</span></span> 20<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">10</span></span></strong>, Patti, associate professor of women’s studies at Oregon State University, engaged in long-term research related to transnational feminism and militarism, “Geneaologies of Unbelonging: Amerasians and Transnational Adoptees as Legacies of U.S. Militarism in South Korea,” in Militarized Currents: Toward a Decolonized Future in Asia and the Pacific, Ed. Setsu SHigematsu, Keith L. Camacho, Cynthia Enloe, University of Minnesota Press<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">The politics of transnational adoption highlight extreme power differences between nations and require a critical interrogation of a global militarized economy …..</span> Hubinette characterizes contemporary transnational adoption as the involuntary movement of (predominantly) people of color to the households of (predominantly) white Westerners, part of a system that is increasingly profit driven and motivated by consumer demand, involving the loss of family, culture, and language.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Incorporation of social justice into the terrain of transnational adoption is important for building long-term coalitions that have broader appeal in combatting colonialism and exploitation</strong><br />
<strong><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Perry</span></span> 19<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">98</span></span>,</strong> Twila, Professor of Law, Rutgers University, “Transracial and International Adoption: Mothers, Hierarchy, Race, and Feminist Legal Theory,” 10 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism 101<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">What should this kind of a broad definition of feminism mean for the analysis of transracial and international adoption? It must mean, at the very least, that the</span> <span class="underline">analysis of adoption must</span> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">go beyond the sphere of individual relationships to</span> <span class="underline">incorporate larger political issues involving race, class, and culture</span>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Thus</span>, <span class="underline">the history of racism in the case of transracial adoption and the history of colonialism, neocolonialism and economic exploitation, in the case of international adoption, must be a part of the analysis</span>…...<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> it must confront as problematic the structure of transracial and international adoption as transactions in which children are transferred from less privileged women to those who are more privileged. Incorporating factors of race, class, culture, and patriarchy should certainly lead to a different analysis of transracial and international adoption than an analysis that is based only on the concepts of supply and demand.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Absent an injection of social justice into international relations, violence and conflict are inevitable. Favoring political expediency is the easy cop-out that sidesteps difficult questions of morality and licenses impunity to commit atrocity.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bassiouni</span></span> 20<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">03</span></span>,</strong> Cherif, Distinguished Professor of Law, President, International Human Rights Law Institute, DePaul University, President, International Institute for Higher Studies in Criminal Science (Siracusa, Italy); President, International Association of Penal Law (Paris, France), “The Role of Justice in Building Peace: Justice and Peace, The Importance of Choosing Accountability Over Realpolitik,” Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law, Spring, 35 Case W. Res. J. Int'l L. 191<br />
<br />
At the end of the Second World War, the world collectively pledged &quot;never again.&quot; While the intention of this global promise may have been sincere, its implementation has proved elusive. ….. <span class="underline">The pursuit of justice and accountability fulfills</span> fundamental <span class="underline">human needs</span> and expresses key values <span class="underline">necessary for the prevention</span> and deterrence <span class="underline">of future conflicts</span>. For this reason, <span class="underline">sacrificing justice and accountability for the immediacy of realpolitik represents a short-term vision of expediency over more enduring human values</span>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 2: the Biopolitical Family</strong><br />
<strong>Transnational adoption turns Korean children into a commodity – this “yellow desire” turns them into something to be bought and sold in the name of the perfect American family…</strong><br />
<strong><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Soojin</span></span> 20<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">10</span></span>, Pate, Ph.D candidate, “Genealogies of Korean Adoption: American Empire, Militarization, and Yellow Desire,” A dissertation submitted to the faculty of the graduate school of the University of Minnesota, May</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span class="underline">Turning the child into an object not only made the orphan a commodity</span> to be purchased in the burgeoning era of consumer capitalism <span class="underline">but also a target of desire</span>. <span class="underline">The combination of</span> traditional <span class="underline">Orientalist stereotypes and Cold War politics of integration produced</span>…..<span class="underline"> for orphaned children transfigures them from human beings into mass-produced products that can be dispersed when cabled and purchased by Westerners</span>.50</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The combination of the civilizing mentality and notions of the appropriate nuclear family coalesce into heteronormativity that makes white supremacy inevitable.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Smith</span></span> 20<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">06</span></span>, Andrea, Assistant Professor of Media and Cultural Studies at the University of California, Riverside, co-founder of the Boarding School Healing Project and INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence, “Heteropatriarchy and the Three Pillars of White Supremacy: Rethinking Women of Color Organizing,” Color of Violence: The Incite! Anthology, South End Press</strong><br />
<strong>As Ann Burlein argues in Lift High the Cross, it may be a mistake to argue that the goal of Christian Right politics is to create a theocracy in the United States. Rather….. <span class="underline">such struggles will maintain colonialism based on a politics of secondary marginlization where the most elite class of these groups will further their aspirations on the backs of those most marginalized </span>within the community.</strong><br />
<br />

<strong>For the theoretical purposes of this essay, <span class="underline">white supremacy may be understood as a logic of social organization that produces regimented, institutionalized, and militarized conceptions of hierarchized “human” difference, enforced through coercions and violences that are structured by genocidal possibility</span> …… which <span class="underline">this material logic of violence overdetermines the social, political, economic, and cultural structures that compose American globality </span>and constitute the common sense that is organic to its ordering.</strong><br />

<strong>The entire process of the Korean orphanage is one of regulating and controlling the body. This is a disciplinary normalization technique that forces the orphan into an image of the American citizen in order to give the state power over life.</strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Foucault’s corpus investigates the relationship between technologies of power and the management of populations and the self. In scrutinizing the medical clinic, mental institutions, and prisons</span>, <span class="underline">Foucault</span> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">gazes upon the margins of society in order to gain knowledge about the relationship between technologies of power and the operations of the self. By investigating this relationship, he ultimately</span> <span class="underline">explains how the normal is differentiated from the abnormal</span>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">As such,</span> <span class="underline">his theories are useful in examining how adoptable orphans are differentiated from the unadoptable</span>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">To be sure,</span> <span class="underline">not all orphans are considered adoptable; …….</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Sometimes they arrive pitifully thin, but they soon blossom into beautiful children when they know they are loved and given proper food.”81 Knowing what is wrong with the child helps them to provide the child with the correct treatment. Boils, rashes, stuffy lungs, and infected eyes are all treatable and can be cured with the right medication. And if malnourishment is the only thing that is wrong with the orphan, proper diet and nutrition can cure that, as well. Knowledge is indeed power.</span></strong><br />

<strong>This power over life licenses war and ultimately puts all biological existence at stake</strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">For a long time, one of the characteristic privileges of sovereign power was the right to decide life and death. In a formal sense, it derived no doubt from the ancient patria potestas that granted the father of the Roman family the right to “dispose” of the life of his children and his slaves; just as he had given them life, so he could take it away. By the time the right of life and death was framed by the classical theoreticians……..</span><span class="underline">at stake is the biological existence of a population</span>. <span class="underline">If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers</span>,<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill;</span> <span class="underline">it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population</span>.</strong><br />

<strong>Contention 3: Solvency</strong><br />
<strong>The plan’s removal of military presence is the recognition that, even in times of “peace,” the military is violent and produces displaced populations that are erased from their culture in order to be later rescued in the name of U.S. imperialism.</strong><br />

The structural impacts of transnational adoption and militarism should be overly emphasized in your decision-making in the face of seemingly large negative impacts. Rendering this violence invisible create the long-term conditions that make genocide and war possible.<br />

<span style="font-weight: normal;">Our interpretation is that the plan has to specify the timeframe of the withdrawal.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal; margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;">1. <strong>No Plan withdraws immediately, that idea is pure stupidity. Instead, every withdrawal is either complete or phased and both would take months – we have to dismantle bases, ship weapons back, and fly troops home – Iraq proves.</strong></span><br />
<strong><span class="SourceBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dreazen 8</span></span></strong>, Yochi J. Dreazen, The Wall Street Journal, Pentagon Wary of Fast Iraq Withdrawal, 11/18/2008, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122696942306335651.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122696942306335651.html</a></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">Many senior military officials agree with Mr. Obama's call to withdraw tens of thousands of troops from Iraq next year. They believe that the large U.S. military presence in Iraq is causing significant manpower strains on the armed forces and preventing needed reinforcements from being sent to Afghanistan, where conditions have worsened in recent months. Still, <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">there is a fair amount of skepticism within the Pentagon about Mr. Obama's call to have all U.S. forces out of Iraq by 2010</span></span>. In recent interviews, two high-ranking officers stated flatly that <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">it would be logistically impossible to dismantle dozens of large U.S. bases there and withdraw the 150,000 troops now in Iraq so quickly</span></span>. </span><br />
<strong><span style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;">2. There is no “normal means” for a withdrawal – multiple timeframes and each has comparative advantages and disadvantages – specification is key</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="SourceBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">New York Times 2009</span></span></strong> (“Obama Favoring Mid-2010 Pullout In Iraq, Aides Say,” pg nexis) <br />
Mr. Obama, who met with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates on Tuesday, has not made a final decision but could complete his review and announce his plan this week, administration officials said. In his speech to Congress on Tuesday night, Mr. Obama said only that he would ''soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war.'' It was not clear on Tuesday exactly how many of the 140,000 troops would remain in Iraq after August 2010 or whether any of the 14 combat brigades now there would stay under a new mission. The 19-month time frame for the withdrawal of combat troops was first reported Tuesday by The Associated Press. The approach split the difference with military commanders who proposed a range of options, including the 16-month withdrawal Mr. Obama promised last year and <span class="underline">a longer timetable that would</span> have <span class="underline">spread the withdrawal over 23 months</span>. Mr. Obama 's advisers said they believed they had reached an accommodation that would satisfy both the military and a public eager to get out of Iraq, while relieving the strain on the armed forces and freeing up resources for Afghanistan. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">''The president has been struck by the fact that there has been a meeting of the minds in a lot of ways among his military advisers about what would be a safe and responsible way to redeploy our troops while protecting our interests in Iraq</span></span>,'' said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because no decision had been announced. Another top official said the White House was confident that those who supported Mr. Obama 's election would accept a somewhat longer time frame. ''He's always said that he would consult with his military commanders on this and would reach a responsible, appropriate decision,'' the official said. ''This is not a very large deviation.'' The troop withdrawal could also help to ease the budget pressure the White House is facing as Mr. Obama seeks to make good on a promise to cut the federal deficit in half by 2013, when his current term will end. In recent weeks, <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">Mr. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, discussed the three withdrawal options -- 16, 19 and 23 months -- with the president. Pentagon officials characterized the talks as extensive and said that each option was presented with what Mr. Gates and Admiral Mullen saw as the accompanying risks.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Violation – the plan text never specifies when the reduction will be completed</span><br />

<strong>Reasons to prefer –</strong><br />
<strong><span style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;">1. Ground – solvency debates require a solid timeframe as do disadvantages. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="text-decoration: none;">2. Fairness – Allows 2AC re-clarification of when the withdrawal will be complete and spikes out of negative offense. </span></span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;">3. Education – Iraq and Afghanistan prove congressman have to propose specific timeframes for phased withdrawals, they kill real world education. Even if potential abuse isn’t a voter and they grant us all links, we still lose that education – independent voter</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;">4. No Solvency – Their plan text would be rejected from the floor of congress due to vagueness. No bill or withdrawal proposal passes without a timeframe specified. That’s another voter for good plan text writing.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;">5. Plan text key- Plan text specification is key to contextualization and argumentation skills. It’s the central advocacy in the round. Evaluate the plan text in a vacuum.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in;">6. Evaluate specification issues in terms of who creates the most politically productive form of debate.</span></strong><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Feminists have developed extensive critiques of law n2 and proposals for legal reform. n3 Feminists have had much less to say, however, about what the &quot;doing&quot; of law should entail and what truth status to give to the legal claims that follow. These</span> <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray; font-size: 11pt;">methodological issues matter because methods shape one's view of the possibilities for legal practice and reform. Method &quot;organizes the apprehension of truth; it determines what counts as evidence and defines what is taken as verification</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.&quot; n4 Feminists cannot ignore method, because if they <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">seek to challenge existing structures of power </span>with the same methods that [*831] have defined what counts within those structures, they may instead &quot;recreate the illegitimate power structures [that they are] trying to identify and undermine.&quot; n5 Method matters also because without an understanding of feminist methods, feminist claims in the law will not be perceived as legitimate or &quot;correct.&quot; I suspect that many who dismiss feminism as trivial or inconsequential misunderstand it. Feminists have tended to focus on defending their various substantive positions or political agendas, even among themselves. Greater <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">attention to issues of method </span>may help to anchor these defenses, to explain why feminist agendas often appear so radical (or not radical enough), and even to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">establish</span> some <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">common ground among feminists</span>. As feminists articulate their methods, they can become more aware of the nature of what they do, and thus do it better. Thinking about method is empowering. When I require myself to explain what I do, I am likely to discover how to improve what I earlier may have taken for granted. In the process, I am likely to become more committed to what it is that I have improved</span></span><u>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This likelihood, at least, is a central premise of this Article and its primary motivation.</span></span><br />

<strong>C) Specific Link</strong><br />

<span class="SourceBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Warren &amp; Cady 199</strong>6</span></span> (Karen &amp; Duane, “Feminism and Peace: Seeing Connections”, Hypatia Volume: 9. Issue: 2, pp 4, DJ<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">Operationalized, the evidence of patriarchy as a dysfunctional system is found in the behaviors to which it gives rise, (c), and the unmanageability (d), which results. For example, in the United States, current estimates are that one out of every three or four women will be raped by someone she knows; <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray; font-size: 11pt;">globally, rape, sexual harassment, spouse-beating</span></span>, and sado-masochistic pornography <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray; font-size: 11pt;">are examples of behaviors practiced,</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> sanctioned</span></span>, or <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">tolerated within patriarchy<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">. In the realm of environmentally destructive behaviors, strip-mining, factory farming, and pollution of the air, water, and soil are instances of behaviors maintained and sanctioned within patriarchy. </span>They, too, rest on the faulty belief that is okay to “rape the earth,” that it is “man’s God-given right” to have dominion</span></span> (that is, <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">domination) over the earth, that nature has only instrumental value, that environmental destruction is the acceptable price we pay for “progress.” And the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">presumption</span> of warism, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">that war is</span> a natural, righteous, and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">ordinary way to impose dominion</span> on a people or nation, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">goes hand in hand with patriarchy and leads to dysfunctional behaviors of nations and ultimately to international unmanageability.</span> Much of the current “unmanageability” of contemporary life in patriarchal societies, is then viewed as a consequence of a patriarchal preoccupation</span></span> with activities, events, and experiences that reflect historically male-gender-identified beliefs, values, attitudes, and assumptions. Included <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray; font-size: 11pt;">among these real-life consequences are </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">precisely those concerns with <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">nuclear proliferation, war, environmental destruction, and violence towards women</span></span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">,</span> which many feminist see as the logical outgrowth of patriarchal thinking. In fact, it is often only though observing these dysfunctional behaviors—the symptoms of dysfunctionality—that one can truly see that and how patriarchy serves to maintain and perpetuate them<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">.</span> <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray; font-size: 11pt;">When patriarchy is understood as a dysfunctional system, this “unmanageability” can be seen for what it is—as a predictable and thus logical consequence of patriarchy.</span></span> The theme that <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">global environmental crisis, war, and violence generally are predictable and logical consequences of sexism and patriarchal culture</span></span> is pervasive in ecofeminist literature. Ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak, for instance, argues that “a militarism and warfare are continual features of a patriarchal society because they reflect and instill patriarchal values and fulfill needs of such a system. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray; font-size: 11pt;">Acknowledging the context of patriarchal conceptualizations that feed militarism is the first step toward reducing their impact and preserving the earth</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">”.</span> Stated in terms of the foregoing model of patriarchy as a dysfunctional social system, the claim by Spretnak and other feminists take on a clearer meaning: <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Patriarchal conceptual frameworks legitimate impaired thinking</span></span> (about women, national and regional conflict, the environment) <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">which is manifested in behaviors which</span></span>, if continued, <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">will make life on earth</span></span> difficult, if not <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">impossible</span></span>. It is a stark message, but it is plausible. Its plausibility lies in understanding the conceptual roots of various women-nature-peace connections in regional, national and global contexts.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span class="small">Like other historical narratives, however, the stories of women and the occupation are complex and contested.

This more critical argument, however, has been over- shadowed by the narrative of successful gender</span> <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">democratization</span></span><span class="small">, which as I have shown,</span> <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">has</span></span> <span class="small">far more </span><span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">institutional support from women’s studies,</span></span><span class="small"> as well as the stamp of authenticity from the American women occupiers. A su ggestive, a lthough n ot f ully de veloped, p erspective i s offered i n a short article by Yoda Seiichi, who argues thatrather than ge</span>nuine democ- ratization, the major objectives of the occupation were the demilitarization, modernization, an d tr ansformation <span class="small">o f J apan in to an e ffective ally in the emerging Cold War. Instead of the occupation’s gender reform accomplishing the liberation of Japanese women or radicalizing Japanese gender relations, the intention was actually to create Japanese women who would be enfran- chised and conservative allies for the United States. Posing as the liberator of Japanese women is seen as a U.S. strategy to gain the allegiance of women in the occupied country.</span> <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yoda’s work <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">points to the need to examine gendered strategies of the occupiers, </span>not simply women’s experiences, in analyzing the U.S. occupation </span></span>of Japan.<span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> It calls for a careful and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">systematic study of how the concept of gender</span></span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;"> <span class="small">(</span></span><span class="small">i.e., a binary opposition between the meanings associated with women or femininity and men or masculinity)</span> <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">was mobilized to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% darkgray;">inform the occupiers’ discourses and practices</span>.</span></span><span class="small">21 Yoda’s insight concerning gendered dynamics of the occupation is further developed in a number of studies that examine U.S. Cold War cultural forma- tion. Lisa Yoneyama’s recent article analyzes U.S. media portrayals of the occupation’s gender reform and argues that during the occupation</span> <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">a feminist discourse of </span></span>Japanese w omen’s <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">emancipation and rehabilitation</span></span><span class="underline"> was </span><span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">mobilized to disseminate an image of new</span></span><span class="small">—feminized and pacified—</span><span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Japan and to affirm and justify Cold War U.S. hegemony both domestically and internationally.</span></span><span class="small"> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Such understanding of the occupation also depended on and recir- culated t he f eminist i mperialist n otion t hat Western, e specially A merican, women were more emancipated, progressive, and thus superior.

Caroline Chung Simpson’s An Absent Presence: Japanese Americans in P ostwar A merican Cult ure, 1 945—1960, N aoko Sh ibusawa’s America’s Geisha Ally: Reimagining the Japanese Enemy, and Christina Klein’s Cold War Orientalism: Asia in the Middlebrow Imagination, 1945—1961, also show t he sig nificance o f g ender i n A merican C old W ar f ormation w here American self was frequently imagined as masculine and others (i.e., Japa- nese Americans, Japanese<span class="small">, and Asians) as feminine. 22 </span></span><span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The studies on women and the U.S. occupation</span></span> <span class="small">I have r eviewed here</span> <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">provide important historical information, and often drastically different conclusions,</span></span><span class="small"> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">but their analyses are insufficient, and even flawed, in a number of ways. Pharr and other scholars who define the occupation as a successful feminist reform implicitly rely on an essentialist assumption about women: American and Japanese women naturally shared, because of gender, the same political v isions a nd i nterests—the fight a gainst pa triarchal do mination, whether b y t he ma le-dominant J apanese s tate o r t he ma le-dominant U .S. occupation. Such an argument conceals a multitude of hierarchies, as well as complex negotiations, that existed between women of the victorious occu- pying nation and those of the defeated and occupied. Furthermore, both the studies that focus on middle-class women’s experiences and the studies of their working-class counterparts each draw their conclusions about the occupation by wrongly generalizing class-specific experiences to the entire population of Japanese women. Both fail to consider the category of “Japanese women” as heterogeneous and diverse, segmented by class, race, and other workings of power. Similarly, their implicit assumption that the American occupiers were a c oherent, h omogeneous c ategory r esults i n a s tatic u nderstanding o f t he occupation.

 A. The idea that our political concern should be the emancipation of particular groups and identities is a disastrous failure which leaves us powerless against neoliberal oppression and justifies military violence. <br />
<span class="SourceBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ingram ‘2005</span></span> (James D., political science at McMaster [not the musician], Can Universalism Still Be Radical? Alain Badiou’s Politics of Truth, constellations 12 no 4, wiley interscience / Blackwell)<br />
<span style="text-align: justify;"><u>Badiou’s claim</u> in the polemical first half of <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Ethics is that the recent ‘ethical turn’ in philosophy and politics has been a catastrophe</span></span>. By this ‘ethical turn’ he has in mind two currents of thought that are often thought to be opposed: (a) human rights-based universalism (Kant, Habermas) and (b) difference-based, ‘Other-centric’ thinking (Lévinas, Derrida). He identifies these currents with two recent political trends: (a) <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the politics of human rights</span></span> and humanitarian interven- tion <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and (b) the rise of communitarianism and identity politics. His broad historical- political claim is that this composite ethical ideology, which promised to prevent harm, protect rights, and respect difference, has instead led to “the unrestrained pursuit of self-interest, the disappearance or extreme fragility of emancipatory politics, the multiplication of ‘ethnic’ conflicts, and the universality of unbridled competition” (10). This bleak landscape resulted not from a corruption of or fail- ure to implement the new ethical ideology, but at least in part from this ideology itsel</span></span><u>f</u>. How could this be? (a) Badiou holds that <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the rhetoric of human rights serves as a distraction from and support for a radically unjust world order dominated by global capitalism and great power neo-imperialism</span></span>. This is of course old hat on the further reaches of the left. More interesting is his account of why it is so. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Human rights</span></span>, he argues, necessarily <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">rest on a conception of the human. Since these rights are meant to be universal, this conception must perforce aim at the lowest common denominator, “a passive, pathetic...subject – he who suffers</span></span>” (9). The bearer of human rights is a potential victim, defined by his needs or at most his interests. He is reduced to his most basic, animalistic nature – “a biological species, a ‘biped without feath- ers,’ whose charms are not obvious” (12). Human rights’ sole imperative is to keep this miserable creature from harm.<span style="font-size: 9pt;">4 </span><span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Obscured behind this imperative are the questions of how this creature got into this predicament and what more it might make of itself. </span></span>Since the barbarity of the situation is considered only in terms of ‘human rights’ – whereas in fact we are always dealing with a political situation, one that calls for a political thought-practice, one that is peopled by its own authentic actors – it isperceived...as the uncivilized that demands of the civilized a civilizing intervention. (13) <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Here we meet the other figure human rights thinking juxtaposes to the victim: “the active, determining subject of judgement – he who, in identifying suffering, knows that it must be stopped by all available means” (9). Simply put, rights are effective only when there is a power to define and enforce them; they require an agent outside and above their beneficiaries</span></span>. For liberalism since the seventeenth century, this has been the state; for today’s human rights ideol- ogy, it is ideally a cosmopolitan humanitocracy, in practice any agent with the means. In a radically unjust world made up of enormous concentrations of wealth and power on the one hand and masses of powerless people on the other, it is easy to see how the humanitarian imperative can become a new white man’s burden,<span style="font-size: 9pt;">5 </span>authorizing exercises of power by the prosperous on behalf of suffering wretches elsewhere. The beneficent humanicrat or Marine tries to alleviate the suffering this order causes, allowing the comfortable to feel magnanimous while doing nothing to address the underlying problems. Meanwhile, the underlying structural inequality is reinforced by the built-in asymmetry between rescuer and rescued.<span style="font-size: 9pt;">6</span> (b) <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Badiou’s case against the difference-friendly, ‘Other-centric’ version of the ethical turn focuses on domestic rather than international politics.</span></span> He first attacks attempts to use Lévinas’s ideas about the ‘Other’ as a placeholder for ‘sensitivity to difference.’ <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The only ‘Altogether-Other</span></span>,’ the only guarantee of the experience the ‘face of the Other’ as one of absolute alterity, is God. What Lévinas proposes, argues Badiou<span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, is not philosophy but theology.</span></span> What remains when these ideas are stripped of God is “a pious discourse without piety, a spiritual supplement for incompetent governments, and a cultural sociology preached...in lieu of the late class struggle” (23). This <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">reverence for otherness is moreover a recipe for hypocrisy, since no politics can accommodate every Other, let alone an Altogether-Other</span></span>. Some Others always prove altogether too other. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“[T]he self- declared apostles of...the ‘right to difference,” observes Badiou, “are clearly horrified by any vigorously sustained difference. For them, African customs are barbaric, Muslims are dreadful, the Chinese are totalitarian, and so on” (24). Respect for difference thus ends up defining an identity with strict limits, those of the liberal West, and the imperative of “a conquering civilization: ‘Become like me and I will respect your difference’”</span></span> (25). Badiou’s point is not to deny the inevitability of limits; it is to repudiate ‘ethical ideologies’ that do so. A deeper problem with the ethics of difference takes us closer to Badiou’s core political-philosophical concerns. “Infinite alterity,” he asserts, “is quite simply <em>what there is</em>” (25). We can think here of the conventional notion of civil society as the realm of plurality and inequality. The fact of human plurality, “as obvious in the difference between me and my cousin from Lyon as it is between the Shi’ite ‘community’ of Iraq and the fat cowboys of Texas” (this written in 1993, when the juxtaposition also suggested itself), is without positive political significance; it expresses only “a tourist’s fascination for the diversity of morals, customs and beliefs” (26). Like the dilemmas of toleration, plurality per se doesn’t interest Badiou.<span style="font-size: 9pt;">7 </span>For him, the problem is not difference but inequality. Politics and ethics are not about the management of differences, but about projects to transcend them. Thus, an obsession with difference is no less anti-political and conservative than human rights thinking. Indeed, it can be more pernicious, since the elevation of the fact of difference into a principle authorizes inequality or separatism.<span style="font-size: 9pt;">8</span></span><br />

B. The impact is that the affirmative justifies violence against those they try to help and reproduces existing inequalities while foreclosing the possibility of emancipictory alternatives, turns the case<br />
<span class="SourceBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ingram ‘2005</span></span> (James D., political science at McMaster [not the musician], Can Universalism Still Be Radical? Alain Badiou’s Politics of Truth, constellations 12 no 4, wiley interscience / Blackwell)<br />
<span style="text-align: justify;"> Badiou sees <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">these two strands of ethical thinking as an obstacle to politics because of another feature they share: an understanding of Evil. Both conceive of Evil as logically and practically prior to Good </span></span>(Badiou’s capitals). While notions of the Good are notoriously plural, they reason, <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">it is easy enough to say what is bad: violence, cruelty, suffering</span></span><u>,</u> etc. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">For both forms of ethics, the goal of politics is to avert the worst. By the same token, they are unremittingly hostile to any positive or emancipatory project: “every revolutionary project stigmatized as ‘utopian’ turns, we are told, into a totalitarian nightmare.... Every collective will to the Good creates Evil</span></span><u>”</u> (13). <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The same principle that authorizes today’s amalgam of consensus and identity politics at home and military humanism abroad prevents the emergence of any political alternative, leaving the ravages of the state system and the global economy unopposed: “By blocking, in the name of Evil and of human rights, the way towards the positive prescription of possibilities...it accepts the play of necessity as the objective basis for all judgements of value”</span></span> (31–32). <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In both versions, then, the ethical ideology amounts to a defense of the status quo, reinforcing exist- ing inequalities and divisions while standing in the way of projects that might overcome them.</span></span></span><br />

C. The alternative is to reject the affirmative in favor of an ethic of truth<br />
Practically, this means refusing their question: how should we protect certain identities such as _? Instead, the alternative asks us to create new and inclusive identities which protect transcendental equality and true humanity. Only the alt solves the case and prevents the violent excesses of neoliberalism<br />
<span class="SourceBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ingram ‘2005</span></span> (James D., political science at McMaster [not the musician], Can Universalism Still Be Radical? Alain Badiou’s Politics of Truth, constellations 12 no 4, wiley interscience / Blackwell)<br />
<span style="text-align: justify;">Badiou insists that <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">we can and should aim higher</span></span>. To this end he proposes an alternative, activist ethics he calls <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">an ‘ethic of truths.’ Rather than merely protect life, interests, or identities, for Badiou the challenge of ethics and politics is to invent new forms of commonality and equality. Such projects transcend what is and seek to transform it. This is an ethical matter because it requires another, affirmative vision of the human: only by attaching ourselves to such a project can we rise above the miserable, self-interested creatures of human rights or the cramped, defensive identities of multiculturalism and become fully human – thinking, acting, creating, cooperating beings. </span></span>Badiou’s ontology, sketched in <em>Ethics</em> and worked out in <em>L’Être et l’événe- ment</em>, is devoted to this possibility. As the title of the latter suggests, Badiou divides the world in two. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">On the one hand, there is what is: the realm of being – static, self-perpetuating multiplicity. Badiou refers to this as the ‘situation</span></span><u>’</u> or ‘state of affairs’ (the reference to the state is not accidental). Here everything can be named, counted, and managed; we are defined by our needs, interests, and identities<span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. On the other hand, there are events. An event is the appearance of something foreign to the situation that cannot be encompassed within it. It breaks through the order of things, making possible new ways of thinking, acting, and being</span></span>. For Badiou, events take place in four realms: politics (e.g., the French Rev- olution), science (Galilean physics), art (Haydn’s classicism), and love (Abelard and Eloise) (41). Since events are alien to the situation, however, they cannot be recognized, counted, or named within it. We can recognize them only by their effects, or more precisely by the new thoughts and actions they make possible. Thus, the ‘French Revolution’ refers not to a set of occurrences in France between 1789 and 1794, but to an interruption and opening that inspires new thought and action (the Paris Commune, the Bolshevik Revolution, etc.). <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Badiou refers to these openings as ‘truths.’ By this he does not mean truth of the ‘the-cat-is-on-the-mat’ or the ‘water-is-H2O’ variety, but something between a principle and an epiphany, as when we speak of the truth of an artwork or a love. Truths are both world-disclosing and practical: they cast the world in a new light and demand that we do something. Following an ethics of truth means seek- ing to elaborate the truth of an event. Since events arise from particular circum- stances, however, “[t]here is no ethics in general. There are only...ethics of processes by which we treat the possibilities of situations</span></span>” (16). Truths are subjective, existing only insofar as I decide to be oriented by an event. Yet they transcend the individual: only through my “disinterested interest” (49) in a truth do I transcend mere self-interest and become an active subject – an ‘Immortal,’ in Badiou’s language, the agent of a truth greater than myself. ‘Ethics’ in Badiou’s sense thus has as little to do with an Aristotelian ethos or a Kantian fact of reason as ‘truth’ does with correspondence or consensus. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">For Badiou, ethics consists in the injunction to continue a truth-process – his version of Lacan’s maxim, ‘do not give up on your desire.’ We can now see why for Badiou ethics is not about preventing Evil, but realiz- ing Good. Evil is not “the violence that the human animal employs to persevere in its being, to pursue its interests</span></span>,” which for Badiou, as for most of western philos- ophy, is “<em>beneath</em> Good and Evil” (66). <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Rather, Evil is “a (possible) effect of the Good itself” (61); it is Good gone awry. This can happen in three ways. The first, which he calls ‘simulacrum,’ occurs when we are mistaken about an event, falling for a mere parody. His example is Nazism</span></span>, which mimicked republican and socialist revolution but lacked their inclusive character, basing itself instead on a racist ideology. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The second, ‘betrayal,’ results when we fail to uphold the Lacanian injunction, compromising a truth in the face of obstacles.</span></span> This typically comes when the charisma of a revolutionary event becomes routinized and conformist rather than productive of further creativity. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The third, ‘disaster,’ arises when we try to impose a truth on the whole of reality. A truth cannot simply overturn everything; it must somehow be articulated with the world it finds. Disaster, Badiou explains, is what happened with Nietzsche,</span></span> the Cultural Revolution’s Red Guards, and certain positivists and Romantics (84): <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">they took their truths to be total, forgetting that every way of looking at the world is partial. We might think of the fanatic who sees sin or betrayal lurking everywhere, or of the lovers in Bertolucci’s The Dreamers, who in the name of passion give up housekeeping, buying groceries, and eventually life itself.</span></span></span><br />

Build a better mousetrap is the mantra of U.S. companies, colleges and legions of solo inventors. Now, <span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the patent system</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> underpinning that innovation engine </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">is <span style="border: medium none;">on track<span style="border: medium none;"> to get its </span></span></span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">first</span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> major overhaul</span></span> in more than 50 years. <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The Senate on March 8 passed the America Invents Act</span></span> 95-5, after three similar attempts in the past six years stalled. <span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The House plans to take up the matter in <span style="border: medium none;">weeks</span></span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">. President </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Obama has pushed for patent reform</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">. Various groups representing big companies, tech companies and small inventors continue to wrangle, but </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">it seems the many sides are <span style="border: medium none;">close to an agreement<span style="border: medium none;">. &quot;Overall, we believe it is a great step forward</span></span></span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">,&quot;</span></span> said Gary Griswold, chairman of Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform. The bill would let the U.S. Patent Office set and keep its filing fees, which should help the overstressed agency tackle a backlog of more than 700,000 patents to review. Applications typically take 30 months to process. <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">But a far more fundamental — and still contentious — part of reform would change patent laws to a first-to-file system</span></span>, bringing the U.S. in line with most of the world. Big companies say current first-to-invent rules leave them vulnerable to patent challenges years after the fact by people or firms claiming to be the first inventor. They say first-to-file will reduce costly litigation, encouraging innovation. First-to-file &quot;provides for a much more certain patent system,&quot; said Griswold. His coalition includes big companies in 18 fields, such as 3M (MMM), Bristol-Myers (BMY), Caterpillar (CAT), General Electric (GE), General Mills (GIS) and Pfizer (PFE). <span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Big tech firms</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> and major patent holders</span></span>, IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT<span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">), </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">also support the bill</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">.</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">So do the American Intellectual Property Law Association and the Biotechnology Industry Organization. But the Coalition for Patent Fairness, which includes Apple (AAPL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Google (GOOG), Intel (INTC) and Verizon Communications (VZ), opposes the Senate bill. Its beef is in the area of patent re-examinations. It wants disputed patents reviewed at the Patent Office by a team of experts, not lay people, but says the Senate bill restricts this re-exam process. The group has applauded other reform elements, but hopes the House will address its big concern. A third constituency — small firms, VC firms, unions and solo inventors, many of which have banded together under the Innovation Alliance — also wants some changes to the proposal. But showing how far reform has come, the Alliance is officially neutral on the Senate law. &quot;This bill is a compromise and very few entities are excited about it,&quot; said Brian Pomper, executive director of the Alliance. &quot;We aren't fully embracing the bill, but we think the committee did a lot of hard work.&quot; Carl Cooper, a Nevada inventor with 70 patents, says first-to-file hurts small firms and solo inventors. He says small firms can do months of work before filing, while big firms are better suited to file quickly and absorb the expense. It can cost $10,000 to initially file for a patent. Another $30,000 might be spent on attorney fees and additional costs. &quot;Large corporations have engineering teams and legal staffs working full time on patent filings, and it's no big deal for them to pay those fees and get an approval,&quot; said Cooper. Solo inventors and small firms also say that first-to-file is a job killer. Small companies are the leading creator of new jobs.</span> But <span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the consens<span style="border: medium none;">us is that the bill</span></span></span>, in some form, <span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">will reach Obama's desk this year</span></span>, perhaps in a few months. &quot;It has imperfections, but we can live with it,&quot; said Innovation's Pomper. <br />

Have you noticed, by the way, that <span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">there’s always some obstacle in the path of withdrawal?</span></span> Right now, in Iraq, it’s the aftermath of the March 7th election, hailed as proof that we brought democracy to the Middle East and so, whatever our missteps, did the right thing. As it happens, the election, as many predicted at the time, has led to a potentially explosive gridlock and has yet to come close to resulting in a new governing coalition. With violence on the rise, we’re told, the planned drawdown of American troops to the 50,000 level by August is imperiled. Already, the process, despite repeated assurances, seems to be proceeding slowly. And yet, the thought that an American withdrawal should be held hostage to events among Iraqis all these years later, seems curious.

However</span></span></span>, it is clear that the current S. 23 will be modified before patent reform can be finalized, as <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the administration acknowledged</span></span> that <span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">key provisions are still being negotiated by key stakeholder</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">s</span></span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">'The America Invents Act.' Originally titled “The Patent Reform Act of 2011,” S. 23 was renamed “The America Invents Act” as its primary sponsor, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) began debate on the legislation in the Senate Feb. 28. When the floor action continued March 1, Leahy added the SAP into the Senate record and said, “I thank all those from the administration who worked on this matter and, in particular, Secretary Locke, Director [David J.] Kappos of the Patent and Trademark Office and former [Commerce] Secretary [William M.] Daley.” The bill was reported unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee Feb. 3 (81 PTCJ 451, 2/11/11). Most of its provisions are now geared to modifying or adding procedures at the PTO, though a few provisions directed to litigation remain. One probable floor amendment would put an end to Congress's right to take fees collected by the PTO and use the funds for other governmental purposes. That process, known as fee diversion, has been a point of contention between the judiciary committees of both houses, responsible for substantive law, and their respective appropriations committees, who perceive the funds to be little different from other government taxes. The amendment is highly likely to be submitted on the Senate floor by Sen. Thomas A. Coburn (R-Okla.).

<span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">THE WORLD TODAY faces many challenges</span></span> that require massive investments of private capital in the research and development necessary to create break- through innovations. The United States, which boasts the greatest levels of investment in basic research, has a clear global comparative advantage in economic growth and job creation based on technological inno- vation. And <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">our patent system plays a key role in this commercialization</span></span> of U.S. investments in technology. Adam Jaffe, Harvard University economics pro- fessor and former staff economist for the President’s Council of Economic Advisors, detailed the link between patents and innovation best in testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property in 2007: <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">While </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">creativity</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> is inherent in human nature ... it </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">does not help society, unless it is</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> taken further and </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">converted into </span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">a </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">commercially useful</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> new </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">product</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> or process</span></span>, and this stage of converting inventive ideas into real products is very costly and uncer- tain. <span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The economic function of the patent system is</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> to provide a measure of </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">predictability and protection</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> to this expensive process of product and process development</span></span>.

THE PROBLEM The number of patent applications awaiting exami- nation at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office climbed to more than 1 million by the end of 2006, with the backlog of unexamined applications increasing by 9 percent by the end of 2007, the last year for which complete data are available.2 Dur- ing the same period the number of patents granted by the USPTO actually declined by more than 16,000—despite a substantial increase in examin- ers to a total of 5,477.3 <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">A study by the U.S. Government Accountabil- ity Office </span></span>released in September 2007 <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">concluded that USPTO efforts thus far to address the rise in workload</span></span> through hiring new examiners <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">has failed with the result that the agency “</span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">ultimately may be unable to ful<span style="border: medium none;">fill its mission of ensuring U.S. <span style="border: medium none;">competitiveness</span></span></span></span>.”4 But the USPTO is not alone in falling behind in accomplishing its vital mission. A study by the combined staffs of the European, Japanese, and U.S. patent offices found that the increasing demand for patent rights is a global phenomenon, with a 15.5 percent average growth rate among regional and national patent offices from 2002 through 2006.5 This increasing demand is coming not only from developed countries served by the Euro- pean, U.S., and Japanese systems, but also by emerging nations such as China, India, and South Korea. These countries experienced a 16 percent increase in patent applications from their nation- als between 2002 and 2006.6 Between 2005 and 2006 applications from Chinese inventors alone increased by over 32 percent.7 The United States, however, continues to lead in the number of applications involving high technol- ogy and in the percentage of its citizens filing such applications. Thirty-nine percent of USPTO applica- tions reflect high technology inventions and 55 per- cent of these applications are from U.S. inventors.8 <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Maintaining the U.S. advantage revealed by these statistics will be crucial to the president-elect’s plans to create economic growth through investment in new technologies, particularly green technologies. </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">These statistics emphasize the importance </span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">to the United States </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">of an efficient patent </span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">examination</span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> system that will keep that comparative advantage secure</span></span>. <br />

Recovery is likely to be protracted. The crisis was preceded by the buildup over two decades of enormous amounts of debt throughout the U.S. economy — ultimately totaling almost 350 percent of GDP — and the development of credit-fueled asset bubbles, particularly in the housing sector. When the bubbles burst, huge amounts of wealth were destroyed, and unemployment rose to over 10 percent. The decline of tax revenues and massive countercyclical spending put the U.S. government on an unsustainable fiscal path. Publicly held national debt rose from 38 to over 60 percent of GDP in three years. Without faster economic growth and actions to reduce deficits, publicly held national debt is projected to reach dangerous proportions. If interest rates were to rise significantly, annual interest payments — which already are larger than the defense budget — would crowd out other spending or require substantial tax increases that would undercut economic growth. Even worse, if unanticipated events trigger what economists call a “sudden stop” in credit markets for U.S. debt, the United States would be unable to roll over its outstanding obligations, precipitating a sovereign-debt crisis that would almost certainly compel a radical retrenchment of the United States internationally. Such scenarios would reshape the international order. It was the economic devastation of Britain and France during World War II, as well as the rise of other powers, that led both countries to relinquish their empires. In the late 1960s, British leaders concluded that they lacked the economic capacity to maintain a presence “east of Suez.” Soviet economic weakness, which crystallized under Gorbachev, contributed to their decisions to withdraw from Afghanistan, abandon Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, and allow the Soviet Union to fragment. If the U.S. debt problem goes critical</span>, <span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the U</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">nited </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">S</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">tates </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">would be compelled to retrench, </span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">reducing its military spending</span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> and </span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">shedding</span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> international commitments</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">. We face this domestic challenge while other major powers are experiencing rapid economic growth</span></span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Even though countries such as China, India, and Brazil have profound political, social, demographic, and economic problems, their economies are growing faster than ours, and this could alter the global distribution of power. These trends could in the long term produce a multi-polar world. If U.S. policymakers fail to act and other powers continue to grow, it is not a question of whether but when a new international order will emerge.</span> <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">closing</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> of </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the gap between the U</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">nited </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">S</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">tates </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">and</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> its </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">rivals could inten<span style="border: medium none;">sify <span style="border: medium none;">geopolitical competition </span></span></span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">among major powers, increase incentives for local powers to play major powers against one another, and undercut our will to preclude or respond to international crises because of the higher risk of escalation</span></span>. <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The stakes are high. In modern history, </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the longest</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> period of </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">peace</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> among the great powers </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">has been the era of U.S. leadership</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">. By contrast, </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">multi-polar systems have been unstable,</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> with their competitive</span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> dynamics resulting in</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> frequent crises and </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">major wars</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> among the great powers. Failures of multi-polar international systems produced both world wars</span></span>. <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">American retrenchment could have devastating consequences. </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Without an American security blanket, regional powers could rearm</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> in an attempt to balance against emerging threats.</span></span> Under this scenario, <span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">there would be</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> a heightened possibility of </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">arms races, miscalculation</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">, or other crises </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">spiraling into all-out conflict</span></span>. Alternatively, <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">in seeking to accommodate the stronger powers, weaker powers may shift their geopolitical posture away from the United States. Either way, </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">hostile states</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> would be emboldened to </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">make aggressive moves</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> in their regions</span></span>. <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">As rival powers rise, </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Asia</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> in particular </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">is likely to emerge as</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> a zone of </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">great-power competition. Beijing’s economic rise has enabled</span></span><span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> a </span></span><span class="CardsHighlight"><span style="border: medium none; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">d<span style="border: medium none;">ramatic military buildup</span></span></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">focused on acquisitions of naval, cruise, and ballistic missiles, long-range stealth aircraft, and anti-satellite capabilities. China’s strategic modernization is aimed, ultimately, at denying the United States access to the seas around China. Even as cooperative economic ties in the region have grow</span>n, <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">China’s expansive territorial claims</span></span> — and provocative statements and actions following crises in Korea and incidents at sea — <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">have roiled its relations with South Korea, Japan, India, and Southeast Asian states</span></span>. Still, <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">the United States is the most significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and aggression</span></span>.

<strong>Jeju is political hot potato that can be used as a bargaining chip</strong><br />
<strong>Kyoungeun <span class="Author-Date"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cha 2010</span></span></strong>, FPIF contributor and works for the Peace Network in South Asia, 6/18/<span class="Author-Date"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal;">10</span></span>, FPIF article compiled on Lexis<br />
<span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">The naval base issue has also become a political hot potato in the recent elections on Jeju Island. Most candidates promised to deal decisively with the conflict between the government and the islanders. But the people of Jeju are very mistrustful of the current Jeju governor's handling of the naval base plan.</span></span> When the ministry of the National Defense Department decided to build the naval base site in Geongjeong village, the procedure to secure the agreement of the villagers was not transparent<span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">. The referendum that took place</span></span> on May 14, 2007 <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">did not accurately reflect the real opinions of the residents.</span></span> Four months after the referendum, when the Geongjeong Village People's Council held a vote on the issue, <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">94 percent of the villagers were against the naval base. After the recent election on the island, the naval issue became embroiled in more controversy. As soon as the election finished, Captain Lee Eun-Guk of the Jeju naval base business committee announced that the Navy plans to begin construction in the harbor and bay in September. </span></span>On the other hand, Woo Geun-Min, the newly elected governor, expressed regret over pushing ahead with the naval base plan so precipitously, saying that &quot;Now it's time to respect each other's view.&quot; <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">Jeju islanders have appealed to him. But the new governor has not opposed the naval plan in principle. Rather, he has adopted an ambivalent posture. Last April, 450 Geongjeong villagers filed a suit against the defense minister</span></span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">. </span></span>The suit maintains that the ministry illegally approved the base plan without carrying out an environmental impact statement. The first court decision on the suit will be handed down on July 15. In terms of the conflict between islanders and government, <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">the case of the Jeju base is similar to the situation involving the U.S. military base in Okinawa.</span></span> Former Japanese Prime Minster Yukio Hatoyama resigned after approving the original plan of relocating the Futenma Marine Corps base within Okinawa prefecture. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">Although acknowledging Okinawan concerns, Hatoyama decided to keep Washington happy. Jeju's new governor, like Hatoyama, is caught between local demands and national priorities</span></span><br />

<span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">Our concerns that the establishment of a naval base in Jeju would lead to the complete militarization on Jeju Island are becoming realized</span></span>. On May 8th when Hoichan Noh, congressman from Democratic Labor Party, visited to Jeju, he argued that fighter jets battalion would be deployed in Jeju and the Ministry of National Defense and the local government were negotiating to provide 300,000 pyeong.&quot; In addition, he expressed his suspicion that 'the southern troops for searching and rescuing' planned as part of the mid-term vision of defense was quite same as the plan for Jeju naval base in terms of size, budget, facilities ect. That means <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">although most of Jeju residents oppose the plan, the Ministry of Defense is enforcing the plan for the establishment of a naval base in Jeju only by switching the name to the troops for searching and rescuing. According to the parliamentary records w</span></span>hich Congressman Mr. Noh opened to public<span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">, it seemed obvious that the Defense Ministry also is planning to establish an air base after a naval military base in Jeju. One naval officer's statements in the records tell us the reason why the Defense Ministry has enforced the plan for the establishment of a naval base again since 2005 and lied to the Jeju residents by saying they had no plan for an air base in Jeju</span></span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">.</span></span> &quot;No one doubts about its necessity and practicability of an air base in Jeju. However, when the decision on a naval base hasn't been made yet, bringing up the issue of an air base will risk both plans&quot;, said the officer. And he added, &quot;The Ministry had another plan since 2006 to push for an air base as soon as the problem of a naval base would be settled down.&quot; Although the Navy has insisted on the necessity of a Jeju air base, they denied their plan for it by saying that &quot;Jeju is not a good place for an air base.&quot; in a response letter to PSPD's inquiry. It was such a deceitful manner. Another statement from an Navy officer - &quot;we will just reserve the land for an air base and use it only in case of emergency.&quot;- could be seen as an indication that the recent prior consultation on MOU between the Military of National Defense and the local government of Jeju was to manage to get the land for an air base. Considering our hopes for keeping Jeju as Peace Island which would be functioned as a bridge for peace in Northeast Asia, we have argued <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">that building an air base in Jeju itself is unnecessary.</span></span> Moreover, we have raised our concern that <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">once a naval base is established, additional ground and air forces can be introduced. That will be meant to turn the whole island into a military base. The Ministry of National Defense has insisted that an air forces for searching and rescuing will only work as rescue corps in the sea so far. Ifso, it doesn't make any sense that fighting combat units are included in that plan. Moreover, that doesn't explain the roles of the units which are engaging in local wars in case a territorial conflict breaks out and building up long-distance flight capabilities.</span></span> The Defense Ministry changed the name of the plan to forces for searching and rescuing, but the contents of the plan is exactly same as the one for the establishment of an air base<span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">. Therefore, it is clear that deployment of searching and rescuing forces is only a preparation for building an air base in the future and the efforts for building a naval base will lead to the complete militarization in Jeju.</span></span> We also would like to point out a possibility that a naval base might prompt Korean army's participation in the U.S. activities to keep their military hegemony over the sea. While it is hard to expect the situation that Korean navy will dispatch 7000t AEGIS, LPX, or a submarine to a long distance by itself, it is quite possible if it is an U.S.-Korea joint military operation. As you know, U.S. has consistently asked for the Korean army to take part in their so-called War on Terrorism such as PSI, CSI, RMSI. That is why we has kept suggesting the high-possibilities not only of the Korean army's participation in the U.S. marine military operation, but also of the use of Jeju naval base by the U.S. military. Moreover<span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">, that means that Jeju will possibly be a target in case of Chinese marine operation or military exercise.</span></span> Nevertheless, the Defense Ministry and the local government are pushing for the plan of a naval base in the name of national security and economic development, both of which are very ambiguous. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">As it proceeded, they didn't really pay attention to the residents' opinion.</span></span> They kept saying that they would proceed the project based on the residents' decisions, however, ironically they have opposed to directly ask the people and announced the Defense Ministry would propose sites for a military on their own. Also, the Ministry has raised distrust among the residents by having changed a proposed site several times from Hwasoon to Weemee, and from Weemee to Kangjung again. In addition, they have tried to fool the resident by exaggerating economic benefits from a naval base. Given that settling a military base would have a great effect on the residents' lives, it is very problematic that the Jeju governor announced that the decision would be made by polling the public without enough discussions and verification. In particular, the fact that the local government is negotiating with the Defense Ministry on providing 300,000 pyeong for a military base shows that the polling will be used only as a ground for establishing a military base. The Blue House also supports the moves to establish a military base in Jeju. <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">President Roh used to have a stance to emphasize on the Jeju residents' opinion and to insist on reconsideration for the military plan back in 2002 when he was a candidate for presidency. Later on, when he became president, he declared Jeju as Peace Island. However, he hasn't properly proceed the project for Jeju Peace Island, but rather takes a leading role to build a military base in Jeju</span></span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">.</span></span> President himself debases the vision for Jeju Peace Island. Although president Roh has been calling for peace and prosperity, this situation shows that Roh administration's lack of understanding on peace. Therefore, the Blue house, Defense Ministry and Jeju local government all should take responsibility for the disputes and conflicts surrounding the establishment of a military base among residents. It is also certain that the residents' distrust on them is increasing. As our concer that the establishment of a naval base would be just a start of the complete militarization of Jeju is being realized now, the government should reconsider the plan all over again. The local government should stop all the negotiations on the naval base and make its position clear on an air base. As long as all these suspicious remains, the plan for the establishment of a military base shouldn't be proceeded. Lastly, we would lay stress on the fact that <span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">establishing a naval base jumping on arms race in Northeast Asia will not protect the Korean Peninsula, but rather risk peace in this region by increasing the levels of military tensions.</span></span> We should take a lesson from the past, that<span class="UnderlinedCard"><span style="font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;"> the presence of a military base had rather put Jeju in danger.</span></span> Only establishing the real Peace Island of Jeju will help make the residents' lives and furthermore the Korea Peninsula better.<br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A war between China</span>, Taiwan <span style="font-size: 11pt;">and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war</span>, therefore, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. </span>If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. </span>However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.</span>
