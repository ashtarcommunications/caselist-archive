<strong>Second, the economy is not recovering — millions are unemployed and growth has stalled.</strong><br />

If you went out this morning and saw hundreds of people lining up at soup kitchens, you'd think you were in a time machine, transported back to the Great Depression of the '30s, or the victim of a hallucination incubated by powerful images of those times. AND When economic activity picks up, employers will undoubtedly first choose to increase hours for existing workers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fortunately, the plan boosts growth — we’ll isolate three internal links.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First, jobs — current bond-buying won’t stimulate the real economy — the plan is crucial to increase aggregate demand, GDP, and employment in every state.</strong><br />
<strong>Lau 12</strong> — Lawrence J. Lau, Kwoh-Ting Li Professor of Economic Development in the Department of Economics at Stanford University, Ralph and Claire Landau Professor of Economics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, former vice-chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, holds a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California-Berkeley, 2012 (“What should the Fed do to jump-start US economy?,” China Daily, August 17th, Available Online at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2012-08/17/content_15682382.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2012-08/17/content_15682382.htm</a>, Accessed 10-17-2012)<br />
The world economy has already experienced both &quot;Quantitative Easing I (QE-I)&quot; and &quot;Quantitative Easing II (QE-II)&quot; operations by the US Federal Reserve Board (Fed). AND (In fact, a similar plan can be used for Greece, so that while Greece needs to reduce its recurrent government expenditures, it can still undertake some capital projects so as to maintain some economic growth and prevent unemployment from becoming too high.)<br />
<br />
<strong>Second, investment — the plan spurs private investment in infrastructure — it’s crucial to get conservative investors off the sidelines.</strong><br />
<strong>Greider 11/7</strong> — William Greider, National Affairs Correspondent for The Nation, former reporter and editor at the Washington Post, holds a degree from Princeton University, 2012 (“Can the Federal Reserve Help Prevent a Second Recession?,” The Nation, November 7th, Available Online at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/171126/can-federal-reserve-help-prevent-second-recession" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenation.com/article/171126/can-federal-reserve-help-prevent-second-recession#</a>, Accessed 01-23-2013)<br />
Stephen Sleigh, a labor economist and director of the national pension fund for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, has similar ideas about how the Fed can persuade private capital investment to finance major infrastructure projects. AND If that occurs, these and other proposals for action will become highly relevant.<br />
<br />
<strong>That’s crucial to economic recovery — traditional stimulus fails.</strong><br />
<strong>Carew 12</strong> — Diana G. Carew, Economist at the Progressive Policy Institute, formerly served as policy analyst at the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. and as an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, holds an M.A. in Applied Economics from Johns Hopkins University, 2012 (“Move Over Demand, Make Room for Investment,” The Progressive Fix, August 3rd, Available Online at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.progressivepolicy.org/2012/08/move-over-demand-make-room-for-investment/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=move-over-demand-make-room-for-investment" rel="nofollow">http://www.progressivepolicy.org/2012/08/move-over-demand-make-room-for-investment/</a>, Accessed 08-24-2012)<br />
It’s become conventional wisdom: when the economy falters, it’s because people aren’t spending. AND But until they realize that aim misses the mark we will continue to take the slow, winding road forward.<br />
<br />
<strong>Third, infrastructure — the plan is crucial to revitalize transportation infrastructure — its deterioration crushes the economy.</strong><br />
<strong>Reuters 1/15</strong> — Reuters, 2013 (“Report: 3.5M jobs ride on infrastructure funding,” January 15th, Available Online at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-15/business/chi-report-35m-jobs-ride-on-infrastructure-funding-20130115_1_janet-kavinoky-infrastructure-projects-highway-projects" rel="nofollow">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-15/business/chi-report-35m-jobs-ride-on-infrastructure-funding-20130115_1_janet-kavinoky-infrastructure-projects-highway-projects</a>, Accessed 02-04-2013)<br />

<br />
<strong>Only the plan solves — no disad is unique.</strong><br />

Over the past four years, in an effort to stimulate employment and stabilize the national economy, the Federal Reserve has carried out three exercises it referred to as “Quantitative Easing.” AND In both the long-term and the short-term such a move could be highly beneficial and transformative.<br />
<br />
<strong>And, growth is the controlling internal-link—even small growth-rate differentials produce large fiscal impacts</strong><br />
<strong>Swanson 11</strong> — Bret Swanson, President of Entropy Economics—a research firm focused on technology and the global economy, President of Entropy Capital—a venture firm that invests in early-stage technology companies, Visiting Fellow at Digital Society, Fellow at the National Chamber Foundation, former Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for Global Innovation at The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation, 2011 (“The Growth Imperative,” Forbes, May 27th, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3376:http://www.forbes.com/sites/bretswanson/2011/05/27/the-growth-imperative/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bretswanson/2011/05/27/the-growth-imperative/" rel="nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/sites/bretswanson/2011/05/27/the-growth-imperative/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3376 -->, Accessed 08-29-2012)<br />
The central factor in America’s fiscal future is hardly being discussed. AND Economic growth helps federal, state, and local budgets, sure, but more importantly creates opportunity for generations of Americans, particularly those whose outlook today seems bleakest.<br />

Like the Great Depression, the current economic slump has fanned the firs of nationalist, ethnic and religious hatred around the world. AND But economic growth – and growth alone – creates the additional resources that make it possible to achieve such fundamental goals as higher living standards, national and collective security, a healthier environment, and more liberal and open economies and societies.<br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, economic decline increases the risk of war—strong statistical support.</strong><br />

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. AND Those studies tend to focus on dyadic interdependence instead of global interdependence and do not specifically consider the occurrence of and conditions created by economic crises. As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.<br />

 <br />
<strong>First, Chinese direct investment in the United States is on the brink — failure to improve access will force China to invest elsewhere.</strong><br />
<strong>Hanemann 12/28</strong> — Thilo Hanemann, Research Director at the Rhodium Group where he specializes in Chinese Foreign Direct Investment, 2012 (“Chinese FDI in the U.S. in 2012: A Record Year Amid A Gloomy FDI Environment,” China Economic Watch—a publication of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, December 28th, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3377:http://www.piie.com/blogs/china/?p=2147 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.piie.com/blogs/china/?p=2147" rel="nofollow">http://www.piie.com/blogs/china/?p=2147</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3377 -->, Accessed 01-29-2013)<br />
Developments in 2012 also underscored the political hurdles in the process of China becoming a major source of FDI for the US. AND It is too early to declare Europe the winner in the race for Chinese investment, but it is time for Washington to move past politics, emphasize openness and tackle structural reforms to ensure the United States remains a top destination for FDI from China and elsewhere.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second, infrastructure investment is vital — the status quo is insufficient.</strong><br />
<strong>Caijing 12/18</strong> — Caijing—an independent Beijing-based magazine about finance and economics, 2012 (“Chinese Investment to the U.S. Speeds Up,” Byline Jin Yan and Wang Yanchun, December 18th, Available Online at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://english.caijing.com.cn/2012-12-18/112372718.html" rel="nofollow">http://english.caijing.com.cn/2012-12-18/112372718.html</a>, Accessed 01-29-2013)<br />
With accelerating investment in the United States already a consensus among the Chinese business community, attention has now turned to specific areas for investment. AND <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Those issues aside, the consensus between the two sides is that if the misunderstandings and current obstacles cannot be overcome, a major opportunity for both sides will be squandered.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Third, the plan solves — it spurs Chinese direct investment in U.S. infrastructure.</strong><br />
<strong>Greider 11/7</strong> — William Greider, National Affairs Correspondent for The Nation, former reporter and editor at the Washington Post, holds a degree from Princeton University, 2012 (“Can the Federal Reserve Help Prevent a Second Recession?,” The Nation, November 7th, Available Online at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/171126/can-federal-reserve-help-prevent-second-recession" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenation.com/article/171126/can-federal-reserve-help-prevent-second-recession#</a>, Accessed 01-23-2013)<br />
A solution Sleigh envisions would involve bond borrowing for public-private infrastructure projects that would be “labor-intensive and great for long-term economic growth and would absolutely help us meet our obligations, because these bonds are going to yield 6 to 8 percent on our investments.” AND If that occurs, these and other proposals for action will become highly relevant.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fourth, that cements U.S.-China economic cooperation — it boosts relations and economic growth.</strong><br />
<strong>Backaler 10/3</strong> — Joel Backaler, Director at Frontier Strategy Group—an emerging markets-focused business advisory firm, author of TheChinaObserver.com—an award-winning China business blog, 2012 (“Why the U.S. Needs Chinese Investment,” Business Week, October 3rd, Available Online at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-03/why-the-u-dot-s-dot-needs-chinese-investment" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-03/why-the-u-dot-s-dot-needs-chinese-investment</a>, Accessed 01-29-2013)<br />
China’s own economic slowdown is affecting the latest earnings reports of U.S. companies, including Nike (NKE) and McDonald’s (MCD), which depend on China’s growing economy to fuel their rapid international expansion. AND As Chinese investments continue to increase, whoever assumes office in 2013 should make the promotion of Chinese investment in the United States a priority—both to improve bilateral relations with China and to fuel the U.S. economic recoveryy.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fifth, this improves overall U.S.-China relations and fosters greater cooperation — foreign direct investment is crucial.</strong><br />
<strong>Hills 12/19</strong> — Carla A. Hills, Co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, Chair of the National Committee on United States-China Relations, served as United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President and as a U.S. Trade Representative under President Bush, 2012 (“China's investment in the US benefits both,” China Daily, December 19th, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3378:http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2012-12/19/content_16030764.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2012-12/19/content_16030764.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2012-12/19/content_16030764.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3378 -->, Accessed 01-29-2013)<br />
Leaders of the United States and China have repeatedly stated that the bilateral relationship between the world's two largest economies will shape the 21st century. AND <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">In short, Chinese investment in the US is a win-win proposition for America and for China and should be encouraged by both sides.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Sixth, strong U.S.-China cooperation is crucial to address all global challenges.</strong><br />
<strong>Cohen et al. 9</strong> — William S. Cohen, Chairman and CEO of The Cohen Group—a strategic business consulting firm, served as Secretary of Defense from 1997 until 2001, served in the U.S. Senate from 1979 to 1997 and in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1975 to 1979, et al., 2009 (“Smart Power in U.S.-China Relations,” Smart Power in U.S.-China Relations: A Report of the CSIS Commission on China, March, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3379:http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090304_mcgiffert_uschinasmartpower_web.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090304_mcgiffert_uschinasmartpower_web.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090304_mcgiffert_uschinasmartpower_web.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3379 -->, Accessed 08-13-2012, p. 1)<br />
The evolution of Sino-U.S. relations over the next months, years, and decades has the potential to have a greater impact on global security and prosperity than any other bilateral or multilateral arrangement. AND Virtually no major global challenge can be met without U.S.-China cooperation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, that prevents nuclear war and extinction.</strong><br />

Wittner, Emeritus Professor of History at the State University of New York at Albany, holds a Ph.D. in History from Columbia University, 2011 (“Is a Nuclear War with China Possible?,” Huntington News, November 28th, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3380:http://www.huntingtonnews.net/14446 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huntingtonnews.net/14446" rel="nofollow">http://www.huntingtonnews.net/14446</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3380 -->, Accessed 02-07-2013)<br />

In his recent book The Social Conquest of Earth, Edward O. Wilson lifts a corner of human history and reveals what appears to be a hidden mechanism of its intricately complex guidance system. …But Edward O. Wilson seems to be saying to us that the corruption—no matter how insidious or painful it may be—will, in the larger scheme of things, be merely an incidental cost of great social achievement. It is better to undertake great projects, even though they my be milked by cheats and villains, than to undertake no projects at all.<br />

<em>One useful approach to embracing the classroom as a political site, but at the same time eschewing any form of indoctrination, is for educators to think through the distinction between a politicizing pedagogy, which insists wrongly that students think as we do, and a political pedagogy, which teaches students by example and through dialogue about the importance of power, social responsibility and the importance of taking a stand (without standing still) while rigorously engaging the full range of ideas about an issue….Politicizing education is more religious than secular and more about training than educating; it harbors a great dislike for complicating issues, promoting critical dialogue and generating a culture of questioning.</em><br />

Currently, on the world political stage, there is little discussion of an alternative progressive framework for economics that would significantly counteract the push towards fiscal austerity.

Mean discourse and/or actions of the heart,” Emotion, Space and Society, Volume 2, Issue 2, December, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via ScienceDirect)<br />
Actually existing capitalism can be cruel, ruthless, and destructive, deriving in part from negative emotions such as envy, hate, and indifference to others; but it also can be benevolent, deriving in part from positive emotions such as compassion, empathy, and love. AND The view here denies neither the destructive elements of capitalist life nor the problems of power held by a few over the majority (Foucault, 1980c); rather, it highlights the problematizing potential of practices that diverge from societal discourse towards possibilities for transformational change (Foucault, 2007).<br />

Returning to the premise that the social, economic, cultural, and political are mutually embedded, ‘the economy’ is therefore sensible as a part of life that is connected inextricably with thoughts and feelings, power relations, and histories of experience. AND How, then, has a mode of accounting for behavior based on the logic of a singular discourse developed?<br />

What requires problematization in accounts of behavior that focus on generalities is the notion of ‘dominance,’ which refers not to ‘majority’ in the numerical sense, but rather to those who hold power over others. AND Alternatively, and as argued, we might recognize “the diversity of actually existing markets”, and crucially, their significance as a political resource (Smith, 2005).<br />

 <br />
<strong>First, the Fed just implemented a new round of Quantitative Easing—this non-uniques their “stimulus bad,” “inflation,” and “downgrade” arguments.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Unfortunately, monetary policy alone is insufficient—a substantial increase in transportation infrastructure investment is crucial to reduce unemployment and stimulate demand—now is the key time.</strong><br />

<strong>Hegemony creates structural disincentives for war—theoretical and empirical evidence</strong><br />

The upshot is a near scholarly consensus that unpolarity’s consequences for great power conflict are indeterminate and that a power shift resulting in a return to bipolarity or multipolarity will not raise the specter of great power war. AND by showing that observable evidence concerning the major powers’ identity politics and grand strategies under unipolarity are consistent with the theory’s expectations.<br />

We define (net) public investment as public expenditure that adds to the public physical capital stock. AND Methods for assessing the poverty impact of public expenditure on social sectors such as health and education have been well covered elsewhere in recent years (see for example, van de Walle and Nead, 1995; Sahn and Younger, 2000; and World Bank, 2002).<br />

Students of our monetary system quickly encounter this important question, normally phrased as whether the Federal Reserve System is part of the U.S. Government or is a private organization. AND Therefore despite the ambiguity – and confusion – the Fed is more accurately seen as a private, not a governmental institution, though with substantial governmental ties.<br />

While the global infrastructure universe can be analyzed in a variety of ways, the space can be disaggregated into the following categories: transportation infrastructure, utilities, pipelines and communications infrastructure. AND Some subsectors—such as power generation—may be ignored altogether by “orthodox” investors looking to minimize volatility and correlations to global equities, while other sectors that are only indirectly related to infrastructure—such as mobile telecom companies—may be attractive to “thematic” managers looking for enhanced returns (managers willing to invest in higher-beta, competitively exposed companies).<br />

You usually need depots, roadbeds, and other such capital goods that we refer to as infrastructure. Cars need streets and highways, trains need tracks, airplanes need airports, and boats need docks and ports.<br />

Conservative critics, gloomy after their candidate’s defeat, argue that President Obama, despite his impressive win in a struggling economy, has no mandate. AND But, if words still have meaning, and if the president remains fixed on striking a major deal before dreaded sequestration sinks its claws into the American economy, Obama is now in a position to make a bold move. The stage, in fact, is set.<br />

It long has been highly disturbing that many public officials -- from the president of the United States, members of Congress, justices of the U.S. Supreme Court and on down the line -- have often ignored the Constitution of the United States and the Constitutions of the various states when what the Constitutions say is at variance with what the officials want to do. AND The liberty of us all in America stands on the foundation of constitutional government. We should allow no one to undermine or erode that foundation on issues either small or large.<br />

<strong>Our First Priority should be to First Americans—the affirmative has taken for granted that the United States is built on stolen land.

Leaving aside questions concerning the validity of various treaties, the beginning point for any indigenist endeavor in the United States centers, logically enough, in efforts to restore direct Indian control over the huge portion of the continental United States that was plainly never ceded by native nations. AND Here, I would advance the straightforward premise that the land rights of &quot;First Americans&quot; should be a priority for anyone seriously committed to accomplishing positive change in North America.<br />
<br />
<strong>Vote negative to establish as First Priority the return of indigenous land.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Beginning with Indian land rights is a superior activist strategy—the alternative breaks down the state’s ability to impose all forms of violence.</strong><br />

Not only is it perfectly reasonable to assert that a restoration of native control over unceded lands within the United States would do nothing to perpetuate such problems as sexism and classism, but the reconstitution of indigenous social standards that this would entail stands to free the affected portions of North America from such maladies altogether. AND It follows that realization of indigenous land rights serves to undermine or destroy the ability of the status quo to continue imposing a racist, sexist, classist, homophobic, militaristic order upon non-Indians.<br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, compromise is not an option—the affirmative’s refusal to place Indian land rights as their First Priority makes them complicit with genocidal violence.</strong><br />

If it is beyond challenge that technology is the medium that manages, produces, permits, and administers the daily life of modern societies, a common discourse of engineers and technocrats and security experts often tries to make believe and convince people that the technical and social spheres are separate – when in fact technologies are always already social institutions, devised by individuals and for somethingAND But for that to happen, the scholarship on the international politics of outer Space must get more public space – more media coverage – and try to get its voice to be heard in US policymaking circles.

RW/RR: In The Socialist Alternative, you argue that &quot;given the heterogeneity of the collective worker (and its various forms of immiseration) and capital's use of differences to divide the working class in order to defeat it, a political instrument is needed to mediate among the parts of the collective worker, provide the welcoming space where popular movements can learn from each other and develop the unity necessary to defeat capital.&quot; AND We can use the opportunity of the current crisis to demonstrate how it is a system that we need to go beyond.<br />

Maintaining the stability of a system built upon a whole range of explosive structural antagonisms is quite unthinkable without the superimposition of artificial layers of complexity whose primary function is the perpetuation of the ruling order and the postponement of ‘the moment of truth’.

The ‘medicalization’ of disablement and the tools of classification clearly played an important role in establishing divisions between the ‘disabled’ and the ‘ablebodied’.

The oscillations, standlessness, and opportunism of the left now is justified by appeal to some very right-wing theories that ultimately derive from Nietzsche, Heidegger and their latter-day students such as Derrida, Nancy, and deMan.

The value of Ranciere's intervention literally speaks for itself in precisely this sense. AND The risk is that Ranciere's egalitarianism, like Schiller's aesthetic play, might remain confined to the 'unsubstantial kingdom of the imagination'.<br />
<br />
<strong>Ranciere’s egalitarianism is fundamentally anti-political—it privileges discursive strategies at the expense of material political struggles</strong><br />

That a supposed egalitarianism ends up underwriting a marked authoritarianism is consistent with a more general failing of Rancière’s work, which is that his radicalism seems to be limited to that of early 19th century republicanism. AND What’s missing from Rancière is an understanding of a social revolution which would involve a genuine reconfiguration, rather than a shuffling of appearances: a political movement where “the content goes beyond the phrase.”<br />

In the Oh shit era, the debate, McKibben says, is over. AND The planetary ecological crisis is increasingly all-encompassing, a product of the destructive uncontrollability of a rapidly globalizing capitalist economy, which knows no law other than its own drive to exponential expansion.<br />

Modern capitalism has reached the end of its rope.

There can be little doubt that the miseries faced by the working people of the world today can only be transcended by confronting the system that (re)produces them, and this confrontation will only take place if working people believe they can beat the system.

Elements of an apocalyptic frame could be said to exist in most of the articles we read, though all elements were not present in each article. AND By agreeing with the prophesies, “believers” feel a sense of control over the situation because they are “right,” not necessarily because they are taking collective and personal steps to resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second, this turns and outweighs the case—catastrophic climate reps justify to environmental destruction.</strong><br />

While the dangers of climate change are real, I argue that there are even greater dangers in representing it as the most urgent problem we face. ANDBut while technologically preempting the worst of climate change may temporarily avert some of those losses, such a resolution of the climate quandary will not put an end to—will barely address—the ongoing destruction of life on Earth.<br />
<br />
<strong>The alternative is to replace the affirmative’s apocalyptic framing of climate change with alternative frames that emphasize human agency and responsibility. Vote negative to productively frame climate change.</strong><br />

In conclusion, we hope to inspire more scholarship in the spirit of Moser and Dilling’s (2007) call for a greater inter-disciplinary conversation on climate change. AND Through a less tragic, more productive framing of the issues of climate change, we may expand the common ground needed to build a political will for dealing with climate change.<br />

<strong>FIRST—we control uniqueness – the world is getting better in the status quo because of progressive social change.</strong><br />

Humanity is not in the past, but rather in the making. AND Cynicism always comes cheap. The real challenge lies in recognizing how the &quot;system,&quot; which was never as &quot;totally administered&quot; as many would like to think has been changed for the better through social action inspired by the Enlightenment.<br />
<br />
<strong>SECOND—engagement with the political sphere is crucial to give meaning to theory – the affirmative’s abandonment of Enlightenment politics perpetuates oppression.</strong><br />
Stephen Eric Bronner, Distinguished Professor of Political Science and a Member of the Graduate Faculty in Comparative Literature and German Studies at Rutgers University, 2004 (Reclaiming the Enlightenment: Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement, Published by Columbia University Press, ISBN 9780231126090, p. xii-xiii)<br />
Enlightenment intellectuals provide an analogy for what contemporary intellectuals should strive to accomplish and a model of how to combat oppressive institutions, unjustifiable privileges, and anachronistic cultural practices. AND If philosophy really has been an expression of what Novalis termed &quot;transcendental homelessness,&quot; which I doubt, then perhaps it is time to confront the philosophical with the political and, finally, for the prodigal to return home.<br />
<br />
<strong>SPECIFICALLY—Zizek lacks a practical political agenda—the 1AC was delivered without reference to the kind of society the affirmative seeks or the practical means by which to realize it.</strong><br />
Andrew Robinson, Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Politics at the University of Nottingham, and Simon Tormey, Professor of Politics and Critical Theory at the University of Nottingham, 2004 (“Zizek Is Not A Radical,” an earlier version of an article that appears in Thesis Eleven, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3580:http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3580 -->, Accessed 01-20-2009)<br />
Zizek does not offer much by way of a positive social agenda. AND How is a now 'impossible' model of class struggle be transformed into a politics relevant to the present period?<br />
<br />
<strong>AND—this makes the affirmative an empty gesture—an analysis of historical revolutions reveals the importance of engagement with tangible political programs in order to bring about meaningful change.</strong><br />
Andrew Robinson, Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Politics at the University of Nottingham, and Simon Tormey, Professor of Politics and Critical Theory at the University of Nottingham, 2004 (“Zizek Is Not A Radical,” an earlier version of an article that appears in Thesis Eleven, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3581:http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/simon.tormey/articles/Zizeknotradical.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3581 -->, Accessed 01-20-2009)<br />
As useful as such a reading is, this is not the Zizek who emerges on closer examination. AND The transition from this 'wasteland of the suicide and the solitary killer' to revolutionary politics requires the repetition of negation in a different register,152 connected to a positive project to change the world and relying on the imaginaries Zizek denounces, the carnival spirit and the ability to dream.153<br />
<br />
<strong>HOWEVER—this does not absolve the affirmative of their responsibility for the consequences of their radical gesture – to embrace Zizek’s politics is to embrace the worst forms of barbarism in human history.</strong><br />
Johann <strong>Hari</strong>, award-winning journalist and playwright, Columnist for the Independent, <strong>2007</strong> (“Pseud's corner,” The New Statesman, April 30th, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3582:http://www.newstatesman.com/film/2007/04/slavoj-zizek-intellectual --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/film/2007/04/slavoj-zizek-intellectual" rel="nofollow">http://www.newstatesman.com/film/2007/04/slavoj-zizek-intellectual</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3582 -->, Accessed 01-20-2009)<br />
To the academic world's small population of postmodernists, Slavoj Zizek - a shambling, rambling Slovenian philosopher - is a folk hero. AND In the end, they leave us nothing but a theory-clown with bloody tears.<br />
<br />
<strong>AND—this results in the death of hope – to accept that the “radical act” of the 1ac is the best we can do is to settle for callous inhumanity and the continuation of status quo oppression.</strong><br />

Zizek's anti-capitalism has won him friends in leftist circles, but the capitalism to which he objects is not the capitalism of classical Marxist critique. AND Lacanian theory tends, therefore, to produce an &quot;anything goes&quot; attitude to state action: because everything else is contingent, nothing is to limit the practical consideration of tactics by dominant elites.<br />
<br />
<strong>ULTIMATELY—cynicism is the death of effective politics – by foreclosing hope, the affirmative prevents the realization of a better world. Only embracing hope and taking tangible steps to improve the status quo can effectively overcome the debilitating effects of cynicism and despair.</strong><br />
Dr. Henry A. <strong>Giroux</strong>, Global Television Network Chair in Communication Studies at McMaster University, <strong>2005</strong> (“Translating the Future and the Promise of Democracy,” Address to Convocation of Memorial University of Newfoundland, Gazette, Volume 37, Number 15, June 9th, Available Online at <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3583:http://www.mun.ca/marcomm/gazette/issues/vol37no15/convocation13.php --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mun.ca/marcomm/gazette/issues/vol37no15/convocation13.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.mun.ca/marcomm/gazette/issues/vol37no15/convocation13.php</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3583 -->, Accessed 12-02-2006)<br />
As you well know, the futures we inherit are not of our own making, but the futures we create for generations of young people who follow us arise out of our ability to imagine a better world, recognize our responsibility to others, and define the success of a society to the degree that it can address the needs of coming generations to live in a world in which the obligations of a global democracy and individual responsibility mutually inform each other. AND To quote Bono, a rock star with a political sensibility, “this is a time for bold measures. This is the country, and you are the generation.” Thank you.<br />

<strong>Instead of succumbing to the siren call of the 1AC’s pessimism, we advocate that the judge endorse an alternative approach in which our role as scholars is to actively prefigure—and construct in actuality—alternative social forms.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The goal of our scholarship should be to bring into existence the change we seek, not to heroically isolate ourselves from the ideological order. This political strategy is mutually exclusive with the affirmative’s in every way—the role of the ballot is to choose the superior option.</strong><br />

Zizek's politics are not merely impossible, but potentially despotic, and also (between support for a Master, acceptance of pain and alienation, militarism and the restoration of order) tendentially conservative. AND Through enacting utopia, we have the ability to bring the 'no-where' into the 'now-here'.<br />
<br />
<strong>SECOND—the decision to engage politics is a prior question – the content of that engagement is secondary.</strong><br />
Stephen Eric <strong>Bronner</strong>, Distinguished Professor of Political Science and a Member of the Graduate Faculty in Comparative Literature and German Studies at Rutgers University, <strong>2004</strong> (Reclaiming the Enlightenment: Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement, Published by Columbia University Press, ISBN 9780231126090, p. x)<br />
Enlightenment intellectuals may have laced their political engagement with drama, but they never fell into the trap of demanding all or nothing. AND In keeping with the decline of radical political parties, and the identification of resistance with the expression of subjectivity, the Enlightenment has been subjected to a new metaphysical form of &quot;immanent&quot; critique. Its political legacy has thus become a secondary concern.<br />

<strong>Zizek’s distinction between his politics and bad politics is utterly nonsensical—don’t be fooled by rhetorical tricks that attempt to paper over the violence of the affirmative’s political philosophy.</strong><br />

How does Zizek distinguish his 'leftist' politics from 'rightist' alternatives which would equally meet the formal criteria of an Act? AND Furthermore, if the authenticity of an Act is dependent on an empirical assessment of where the actual social void is, then Zizek's account of the Act as the assertion of a Truth over and against the facts is undermined.<br />

That sentence is a remarkable moment in Zizek's writing. AND I hope so, because the idea that they can hear him without recoiling from him is too dismal, and frightening, to contemplate.<br />

<strong>Turn—Truth:</strong><br />
<strong>A. Zizek doesn’t believe in “truth” – embracing his politics leaves us without the ability to make or test truth claims.</strong><br />

As becomes evident 'class struggle' is not for Zizek an empirical referent and even less a category of Marxisant sociological analysis, but a synonym for the Lacanian Real. AND A 'truth-effect' occurs whenever a work produces a strong emotional reaction, and it need not be identified with empirical accuracy: lies and distortions can have a truth-effect, and factual truth can cover the disavowal of desire and the Real.22<br />
<br />

Why did I do it? AND Nor can we combat false ideas in history, sociology, economics, and politics if we reject the notions of truth and falsity.<br />
2NC—Alternative<br />
Zizek’s focus on individual Acts renders the affirmative decisively conservative – only the alternative can produce real social change.<br />

Furthermore, despite Zizek's emphasis on politics, his discussion of the Act remains resolutely individualist – as befits its clinical origins. AND I also want freedom from people fit to take over'.93<br />

<strong>Prefer our evidence—</strong><br />
<strong>A. Upholding traditional standards for evaluating argumentation is good – it is the only way to productively engage the world of ideas.</strong><br />

The standard format of argumentation is so deeply ingrained in academic culture that it generally goes unremarked. AND While this process cannot, of course, altogether eliminate flaws of observation, description, or reasoning, it does at least invite the scholarly conversation to continue, because conclusions arrived at in this way can either be challenged on the grounds of procedural flaws or can serve as the starting point for further investigation.<br />
<br />
<strong>B. Zizek violates the basic tenets of argumentation – subject their excerpts of his work to strict scrutiny – witty examples are not a reason to vote affirmative.</strong><br />

Zizek's work, by contrast, seems to be formed almost entirely of endgames in which the sense of conclusion, with its payoffs and rewards, is always present. AND Informed throughout by the spirit of conclusion, these units do not, in themselves, conclude, but simply gutter out at the end, like a sparkler; no sense of fairness attends the terminus and no invitation to further work by others is implied.<br />
<br />
<strong>Turn—Methodology:</strong><br />
<strong>A. Lacanian politics are premised upon a flawed methodology – the “constitutive lack” is non-falsifiable pscyho-babble that prefigures the outcome of lacanian analysis. Discard all evidence that relies on psychoanalytic theory to generate conclusions about politics.</strong><br />
Andrew <strong>Robinson</strong>, Ph.D. in Political Theory at the University of Nottingham, <strong>2005</strong> (“The Political Theory of Constitutive Lack: A Critique,” Theory &amp; Event, Volume 8, Issue 1, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Project Muse)<br />
The theoretical underpinnings of political Lacanianism typically rely on a &quot;postmodern&quot; disdain for essentialism, grounds and teleology, and articulate wider belief in contingency (for instance, by emphasizing contemporaneity). AND Laclau in particular emphasizes his belief in the 'exhilarating' significance of the present69, hinting that he is committed to euphoric investments generated through the repetition of the same.<br />
<br />
<strong>B. Holding the affirmative to a rigorous evidentiary standard is key to effective decision-making – without subjecting empirical evidence to the scientific method, the conclusions of their authors should not be evaluated.</strong><br />

<strong>The Aff’s approach to transportation planning sticks with conventional models and processes – that boost instrumental, not communicative, rationality.</strong><br />
<strong>Willson ‘1</strong> (Richard Willson is a professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, California State Polytechnic University, Transportation 28: 1–31, 2001 – <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3592:http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3592 -->)<br />
The paper opens by reviewing and critiquing the instrumental rationality model that is the espoused planning theory of the profession. AND Finally, instrumental rationality assumes that the actors in a planning process are autonomous individuals who refine their knowledge against universal principles, and that planning roles can be divided into various analysis, evaluation and decision-making tasks. In this model, planning activities focus on analytic issues such as modeling and forecasting, impact analysis and economic evaluation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Policy acting without prior, deep public dialogue is steeped in instrumental rationality. Plan and perm shatter social justice and true democracy.</strong><br />
<strong>Willson ‘1</strong> (Richard Willson is a professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, California State Polytechnic University, Transportation 28: 1–31, 2001 – <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3593:http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3593 -->)<br />
Purpose of planning. The purpose of transportation planning continues to be to develop strategies for connecting people and goods with destinations. AND Accordingly, communicative rationality involves experimental approaches because developing the planning process is an explicit part of the planning activity.<br />
<br />
<strong>The alternative to instrumental and scientific rationality is communicative rationality. It unlocks solvency.</strong><br />
<strong>Willson ‘1</strong> (Richard Willson is a professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, California State Polytechnic University, Transportation 28: 1–31, 2001 – <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3594:http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3594 -->)<br />
For planning, however, gridlock is not gridlock until we have defined it as a problem and decided to do something to address it. AND It reorients planning from a form of scientific, instrumental rationality to a form of reason based on consensual discussion.1<br />
<br />
<strong>Implications</strong><br />
<strong>First – Solvency is try-or-die for us – conventional paradigm can no longer succeed.</strong><br />
<strong>Willson ‘1</strong> (Richard Willson is a professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, California State Polytechnic University, Transportation 28: 1–31, 2001 – <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3595:http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3595 -->)<br />
The “problem” of transportation planning increasingly requires a communicative rationality approach. AND Communicative rationality may help transportation planners understand and resolve the dichotomous way that they often think about the rational and political dimensions of their work.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second – Aff’s rationalist approach is epistemologically flawed. Their harm and solvency claims are rigged-games.</strong><br />
<strong>Willson ‘1</strong> (Richard Willson is a professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, California State Polytechnic University, Transportation 28: 1–31, 2001 – <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3596:http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.uvm.edu/~transctr/pdf/willson_article.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3596 -->)<br />
The theory of knowledge, or epistemology, that is implied by instrumental rationality is scientific objectivism. AND In short, political processes rarely “hold still” for the rigid and time-consuming methods of conventional rational planning.<br />

In the new order, the state’s role, along with a range of new institutional structures ranging from the local to the international level, is exclusively to create the stable framework for the efficient functioning of the market.

In this paper, the author argues that transport planning has become highly sciencitized discipline.

Improving one or two intersections or roundabouts could never achieve these moral ends.<br />

But then again, that is precisely one of my points.

In fact, as a further step in this degeneration/development, it now appears that it is very difficult to discern any significant difference between normative legal thought and the operation, performance, reproduction, and proliferation of bureaucratic practices and institutions.

He is a moral character in a world where the role of moral thought has become at best highly ambivalent, a normative thinker in a world where normative legal thought is already largely the bureaucratic logic of institutions.<br />

The history of organized religion shows that intense immersion in at least certain types of normative system is no guarantee against cruelty, intolerance or superstition. 83 AND Judges write with blood, 95 but normativity is the filter that prevents us from seeing this. It focuses our attention on abstraction, when it is particularity and real-world detail that alone move us. 96<br />

In legal thought, the sterility of this approach is manifest in articles that exhort us to engage in choosing behavior while refraining from telling us what to choose. AND Whether such talk has any desired political effect depends on how the aesthetics of power have enabled and constituted this political value talk and on the context within which this political value talk is issued and heard (assuming it is heard at all).<br />
<br />
<strong>Their framework is a rigged game—it presumes that participants in the debate are politically empowered subjects capable of choosing between competing proposals when in fact we are not and the choices have already been made for us.</strong><br />

The Sartrean metaphysic constantly calls for individual subjects to recognize their responsibilities and to choose. AND By presupposing the authenticity of the Sartrean subject, critical legal thought has greatly underestimated the extent to which this &quot;free&quot; subject, in its very &quot;freedom to choose,&quot; is already constructed to compulsively act out choosing behavior – regardless of whether the social, political, or rhetorical scene warrants or even enables a choice to be made at all.<br />

But the subject is a problem.

<strong>Nesting DA—attempts to incorporate our criticism into the normative discourse neutralizes its effectiveness and inoculates normativity against challenges to its hegemony—supercharges our link.</strong><br />

One of the classic ways the normative rhetoric extends and insulates itself from displacement is &quot;nesting.&quot; ANDEven within the ostensibly destabilizing influences that comprise cls thought -- neo-Marxism, phenomenology, structuralism, deconstruction -- the most successful strains of contestatory thought have been those most configured in the image of rationalism: structuralism and Sartrean existentialism. 289<br />

This mimetic repetition and successive embedding of the same rationalist normative rhetoric in different sectors of social life (the intellectual, the professional, and the social), occurs as our attention is focused on other matters – on prescriptions, recommendations, substance, conclusions, theories.

<strong>The affirmative expresses a moral demand for <u>state action</u> to offer compassion and fulfill an obligation to the Other. This call to “make the state ethical” is a form of <u>state soteriology</u> — the aff looks to the state for salvation. This faith in the state should be <u>rejected</u> in favor of faith in the Eucharist.</strong><br />

Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” <em>Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology</em>, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 182-183)<br />
<em>Humankind was created for communion, but is everywhere divided…Nevertheless, I think it is a useful exercise to consider in general terms the pathologies which modern states seem to share—especially that of atomization of the citizenry—and the common stories which serve to enact these pathologies.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>There are <u>three disadvantages</u> to state soteriology:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1. <u>Atomization</u> — The state destroys <u>true connections</u> between individuals.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Cavanaugh 99</u></strong> — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” <em>Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology</em>, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 192-193)<br />
Why has the state failed to save us? Let me outline the argument of this section in three points.<br />
<em>The state mythos is based on a ‘theological’ anthropology which precludes any truly social process…The state can never truly integrate the individual and the group because there is nothing transcending the two-dimensional calculus of individual-aggregate through which individual and group are related.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>2. Homogenization — The state obliterates Otherness.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Cavanaugh 99</u></strong> — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” <em>Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology</em>, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 193-194)<br />
<em>State soteriology has tried to unify humankind by incorporation into a body of a perverse sort…This signals not the acceptance but the obliteration of the identity of the other.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>3. <u>Violence</u> — The state is the <u>primary cause</u> of violence and war.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Cavanaugh 99</u></strong> — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” <em>Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology</em>, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 194)<br />
<em>The state has promised peace but has brought violence…In a word, violence becomes the state’s religio, its habitual discipline for binding us one to another.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>They can’t win <u>offense</u> — defenses of the state lack <u>empirical grounding</u>.</strong><br />

Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 2004 (“Killing For The Telephone Company: Why The Nation-State Is Not The Keeper Of The Common Good,” <em>Modern Theology</em>, Volume 20, Issue 2, April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via EBSCOhost ATLA Serials, p. 243-244)<br />
<em>In Christian social ethics the assumption is often made, with a minimum of examination, that the responsibility for promoting and protecting the common good falls to the state…Only in the conclusion will I make some brief comments on what this implies positively for Christian thinking and practice.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>The alternative is <u>Eucharistic Anarchism</u>. This rejection of state soteriology is <u>mutually exclusive</u> with the aff.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Cavanaugh 99</u></strong> — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” <em>Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology</em>, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 194-195)<br />
<em>If it is true that the modern state is but a false copy of the Body of Christ, then it should be obvious that state power is the last thing the Church should want…My comments—necessarily brief—will follow on the three points of the state mythos I addressed above.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>The alternative <u>alone</u> is better than the aff or permutation — three reasons:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1. It challenges the <u>fundamental distinction</u> between “us” and “them”.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Cavanaugh 99</u></strong> — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” <em>Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology</em>, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 195-196)<br />
<em>The Eucharist defuses both the false theology and the false anthropology of will and right by the stunning ‘public’ leitourgia in which humans are made members of God’s very Body…As members of the Body, we then become nourishment for others—including those not part of the visible Body—in the [end page 195] unending trinitarian economy of gratuitous giving and joyful reception. 53 Property and dominium are thus radically questioned.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>2. It overcomes the <u>dichotomy</u> between center and periphery.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Cavanaugh 99</u></strong> — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” <em>Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology</em>, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 196)<br />
<em>The Eucharist aims to build the Body of Christ, which is not simply centripetal: we are united not just to God, as to the center, but to one another…Here we might apply Alan of Lille’s comment about absolute Being to the Body of Christ: it is an ‘intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.’ 55</em><br />
<br />
<strong>3. It breaks down the <u>boundaries</u> separating people.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Cavanaugh 99</u></strong> — William T. Cavanaugh, Associate Professor of Theology at the University of St. Thomas, 1999 (“The City: Beyond Secular Parodies,” <em>Radical Orthodoxy: A New Theology</em>, Edited by John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward, Published by Routledge, ISBN 0415196981, p. 196-197)<br />
<em>The Eucharist transgresses national boundaries and redefines who our fellow-citizens are. Rousseau was right to note that communion among churches is a [end page 196] threat to the unity of the state…This practice is a sign of the peace which cannot be specified through the formal adjudication of contractual obligations, but can be constructed only in the direct encounter of human beings who consider themselves members of one another and of the Prince of Peace.</em><br />

<em>Understanding this apparently contradictory double movement is crucial to understanding the relationship of the nation-state to the process that has come to be called globalization…Nation-states may be resources for ad hoc resistance to the process of globalization, but in the long run, the prospects for resistance are undermined by the lack of autonomy of the political in the governance of nation-states.</em><br />

All-encompassing Suffering is an all-encompassing phenomenon, and it includes forms of suffering the sufferer is not even aware of.

Why It Is Wrong to Resent Unexpected Changes In Chuang-tzu 18, we find two famous stories in which a man experiences a sudden and deeply personal transformation, a transformation that strikes others around him as deeply troubling.5 AND The Taoist lesson seems, in this regard, to be the same in each case: things happen, and some things cause us distress because we attach ourselves sentimentally to certain people, objects, and patterns of life; when those people, objects, or patterns of life take a sudden or drastic turn into a very different direction, a mature and responsible person calms his or her irrational emotions, and takes the morally responsible course of simply accepting the new state of things.<br />

Moody’s just came out and said, great job, USA, you get to keep your AAA rating…In assigning a negative outlook to the rating, Moody’s indicated, however, that there would be a risk of downgrade if (1) there is a weakening in fiscal discipline in the coming year; (2) further fiscal consolidation measures are not adopted in 2013; (3) the economic outlook deteriorates significantly; or (4) there is an appreciable rise in the US government’s funding costs over and above what is currently expected.<br />

AND Until our economists and officials begin to wrestle with the need for the United States not only to stimulate its economy but to do so in ways that will lay the basis for America to increase its wealth-producing capacity and pay its way, they are likely to find themselves in a continuous state of shock.<br />

The victory of Enrique Peña Nieto, a man notorious for his repression of a poor people’s movement in the town of Atenco when he was governor of the State of Mexico and known as the public face of the country’s most notoriously corrupt party, represents a defeat not only for the left, but for democracy, decency and social justice in Mexico.

The same trend of long-drawn-out survival of the final relicts has been further considered by Bob May’s group at Oxford, particularly Sean Nee.

This section of the paper considers the question of how far the available empirical evidence supports the view that new surface transport infrastructure investment will help to increase GDP – both in terms of the immediate employment impact of the investment itself as a public works project, and then more widely, as a stimulus to general economic activity? AND ‘Today, in mature economies like the UK, with well-established networks and where connectivity between economic centres is already in place, the evidence suggests that there is considerably less scope for transport improvements to deliver the periods of rapid growth seen historically.<br />

Of course, rising food prices adversely affect people from countries that import grain. AND. Inefficiency, corruption and simple mismanagement on the government's part might lead to political instability and even to civil war, but a rise in the prices of food prices by itself is not a cause for instability in grain-exporting<br />

<strong>Transportation insufficient to solve equality — other factors are must come first</strong><br />
<strong>Preston 2009</strong> — John Preston, Transportation Research Group, School of Civil Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton (“Epilogue: Transport policy and social exclusion— Some reflections” Transport Policy 16 (2009), p. 140–142)<br />
Alternative approaches to quantification might involve developing measures of social inclusion as part of ongoing attempts to quantify Quality of Life such as work that has been undertaken for the World Health Organisation (Skevington et al., 2004), for the Economic and Social Research Council (Gilhooly et al., 2003) and for the Audit Commission (2005). AND This is reflective of a wider issue—that transport policy may only be a secondary tool to reducing social exclusion, with policies concerning employment, income, housing, social care, health and education of greater primary importance, although the intermediate goods status of transport means that it has impacts on many of these primary factors.<br />
<br />
<strong>Transportation equality is impossible — strict equality shouldn’t be the goal of policy</strong><br />
<strong>Martens et al 12</strong> — Karel Martens, Institute for Management Research, Radboud University Nijmegen, Aaron Golub, School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning and School of Sustainability, Arizona State University, Glenn Robinson, School of Engineering and Institute for Urban Research, Morgan State University, 2012 (“A justice-theoretic approach to the distribution of transportation benefits: Implications for transportation planning practice in the United States,” Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, Volume 46, Issue 4, May 2012, Pages 684–695)<br />
Let us first consider equal distribution of access in relation to space. AND More precisely, this observation suggests that equality of access cannot be achieved across-the-board and that a non-equal distribution must be proposed explicitly.<br />
<br />
<strong>National transportation policies can’t solve — it is the desire for a hyper mobile world that creates exclusion, not specific policies</strong><br />

Volume 20, March 2012, Pages 105–113, Science Direct)<br />
Urry (2000) builds on this theme of dynamic exclusion from the transport system within his new mobilities paradigm. AND This implies that the problem of transport-related exclusion largely lies outside the influence of national or local policy makers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Transportation not key to equality — other issues are more important to combatting exclusion</strong><br />

Volume 20, March 2012, Pages 105–113, Science Direct)<br />
Furthermore, transport and social exclusion can never survive as a solely transport-focused agenda. AND Similarly, large transport infrastructure projects need to be more transparent in their ex ante analyses to consider their long-term social equity effects on local populations and communities.<br />
<br />
<strong>Housing segregation is the lynchpin of all other forms of racial discrimination.</strong><br />
<strong>Powell 8</strong> — john a. powell, Williams Chair in Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at the Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University and Executive Director of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University, 2008 (“Symposium: The Fair Housing Act After 40 Years: Continuing The Mission To Eliminate Housing Discrimination And Segregation: Reflections on the Past, Looking to the Future: The Fair Housing Act at 40,” Indiana Law Review (41 Ind. L. Rev. 605), Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)<br />
The Fair Housing Act was conceived under a set of conditions very different from the ones we practice in today: a predominately production-oriented subsidized housing market, a clear city-suburban quality-of-life dichotomy, and a simplified mortgage market pre-securitization (and internationalization). AND Failing to ensure fair housing for all Americans will undoubtedly undermine efforts to promote integration in every other area of American life.<br />
