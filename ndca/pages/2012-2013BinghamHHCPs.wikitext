While noting the state's continued innovations in transportation infrastructure and new technology, Snyder called
AND
construction and maintenance contracts to competitive bidding from the public and private sectors.

Cost overruns erode public trust in infrastructure spending. Polling reveals broad support for modernizing

there’s anything that Americans are more cynical about than politics, it’s construction.”

=TIGER (Agenda Ptx)= 
**CP Text: The United States federal government should issue a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery grant for <PLAN>**

In terms of next possible steps for the TIGER program, LaHood said that TIGER

=Reform CP (vs. DAR)= 
**CP Text: The Department of Defense, in coordination with the Department of Transportation, should update, clarify, and communicate the Defense Access Road program’s guidelines to all stakeholders to promote more effective program utilization and ensure regular meetings of appropriate high-level leaders to identify existing federal transportation funding resources and develop a strategy for giving priority consideration to defense-affected communities. The United States federal government should prohibit all further funding increases until Government Accountability Office standards are met.**

**The aff is throwing money at an inefficient program – funding exists, it’s just being utilized incorrectly – the counterplan fixes the funding mechanisms, avoids further investment, and guarantees project effectiveness – zero solvency for the 1AC alone.**
**GAO – 1AC Article – 2011**

At least the pre-typed citations helped) MattG</span>
Why GAO Did This Study: ¶ The unprecedented growth at 26 military installations across
AND
consideration to defense-¶ affected communities. DOD partially concurred with our recommendations.

=Kappeler PIC (vs. Sky Tower Aff)= 
**CP Text: We should imagine.**

**Stopping violence through the conceptualization of problems and solutions as global ignores our individual complicity in atrocities—their focus on the question of preventing violence ignores the more important question: how can we reform ourselves.**
**Kappeler 95**<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif;"> – Susanne, associate professor at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behaviour, p. 10-11</span>
'We are the war' does not mean that the responsibility for a war is shared
AND
our values' according to the structures and the values of war and violence.

=Redirection CP= 
**CP Text: The United States federal government should redirect 99% of Highway Trust Fund revenues to maintain, repair, and enhance existing infrastructure and set aside the other 1% to expand the capacity of each state’s DOT to perform cost-benefit analyses.**

**The CP directs funding into current infrastructure and solves the aff**

Our first substantive proposal, Fix It First, directs revenue from the federal gasoline
AND
The FY2010 allocation of total federal highway spending is shown in Table 1.

We recognize that this proposal on its own, by spending more on existing infrastructure
AND
on speculative expectations of future demand, rather than on known existing demand.
