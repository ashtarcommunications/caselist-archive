A hegemonic neoliberalism utilizing nation building, party politics, the military industrial complex, and a fundamental motive of profit are increasingly the drive of the US into space. This is characterized by an increasing privatization and deregulation of space interests, increasingly foreclosing indigent access.

We redefine what it means to develop space – reappropriating space under the common heritage principle allows for a reduction in the imperialist and neoliberal status quo in space toward a more equal use of space – redistribution and reappropriation of resources, technology, and energy for a more collective society
