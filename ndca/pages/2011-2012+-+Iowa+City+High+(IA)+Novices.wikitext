Launch costs have shelved projects despite tech viability.

Advantage 1: Energy

The energy crunch is here – energy costs have risen and production levels are at their peak
Huhne 6/19/11 [(Chris, “Chris Huhne, we need smart energy in the private sector” online at: http://www.libdemvoice.org/chris-huhne-we-need-smart-regulation-in-the-energy-sector-24487.html, Liberal Democrat politician and cabinet minister, Member of Parliament, and Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change)]

SSP only way to solve – provides infinite clean energy
National Space Society 2011 [National Space Society, 6/3/11, “Space Solar Power Limitless clean energy from space,” 6/21/11 (http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/)]

Warming is caused by fossil fuel use and, unchecked, it leads to extinction
Abbasi, 2010 [Premalatha and Abbasi, Centre for Pollution Control & Environmental Engineering, Pondicherry University Tasneem, M.m S.A., Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, “The return to renewables: Will it help in global warming control?” http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6VMY-514RB5B-C-1&_cdi=6163&_user=655954&_pii=S1364032110003357&_origin=&_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2011&_sk=999849998&view=c&wchp=dGLzVzz-zSkWA&md5=b4de44d87ee97b145615d8716f3cb4a2&ie=/sdarticle.pdf))]

SSP is the only viable option for solving warming because it provides limitless clean energy resources
NSS 11 (National Space Society, 6/3/11, “Space Solar Power Limitless clean energy from space,” 6/21/11 (http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/)]

Advantage 2: Security

Space competition and conflict is inevitable

China is actively militarizing to target and kill space assets

Impending attack prompts miscalc
Tellis 2007 - Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (Ashley, Survival, Autumn, “China’s Military Space Strategy”]

Impending anti-satellite strikes from China will be catastrophic
Choong 2008 [doctorate in strategic studies at the Australian National University (William, The Straits Times, 3/24, “A Pearl Harbor in space?”, lexis)]

Chinese ASAT strikes ensure nuclear retaliation

Causes full-scale US-Russian nuclear war with billions of deaths
PR Newswire, 1998 (4/29, lexis)

Militarization might be inevitable, but weak defenses aren’t. Effectively hardening satellites is vital to prevent war and pre-emption
Kueter 2007 - is president of the George C. Marshall Institute, a nonprofit think tank dediicated to science and technology in public policy (Jeff, New Atlantis, “China's Space Ambitions -- And Ours,” Spring, lexis)

SSP solves – lets us harden satellites, make them more survivable and reconstitute lost assets rapidly
Ramos 2000 US Air Force Major, Thesis submitted for the AIR COMMAND AND STAFF COLL MAXWELL Air Force Base (Kim, “Solar Power Constellations: Implications for the United States Air Force,” April, http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA394928)

The US is the ONLY country in the status quo restrained by a piece of paper
Kueter 2007 [is president of the George C. Marshall Institute, a nonprofit think tank dediicated to science and technology in public policy (Jeff, New Atlantis, “China's Space Ambitions -- And Ours,” Spring, lexis)]

Other countries will tolerate American primacy in space – it upholds the global economic order and they directly benefit
Dolman 2005 – [Professor of Comparative Military Studies at the US Air Force’s School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (Everett C., “U.S. Military Transformation and Weapons in Space,” 9-14-05, http://www.e-parl.net/pages/space_hearing_images/ConfPaper%20Dolman%20US%20Military%20Transform%20&%20Space.pdf)]

Solvency

Technology exists for effective SSP
Costa 2010 [sociobiologist who explains emerging trends in relationship to human evolution, global markets, and new technologies, [Rebecca D., CleanTechnica, 11/1, http://cleantechnica.com/2010/11/01/can-nasa-save-struggling-america/]

There are no technical barriers to SSP implementation
