Refer to Jack in round as "Lance". Just do it. Ask Gavin Singer about the time I dragged him in his underwear into Mary Markley Hall at UMich. Cites can be requested at [[mailto:samthomas719@cox.net|my email]]. This wiki will only show //arguments we ran at tournaments//. To whom I give cites is a function of the effort you put into contacting me. The threshold is low, but existent. I will thus edit this as time goes on with a table of contents and substance.- Sam
