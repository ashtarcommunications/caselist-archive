**Plan: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by establishing a time line of a total withdrawal of United States military troops, beginning first with a substantial reduction. Enforcement and adherence are guaranteed.**

**The transition has begun; US troops in Afghanistan are now greater than in Iraq, and more troops are coming**
**AP 5/24/10** (“More U.S. troops in Afghanistan than Iraq, a first”, http://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2010-05-24-troops-afghanistan_N.htm) 

For the first time….40,000 additional U.S. forces to Afghanistan. 


**And no questions of funding exists – Senate jumpstarted the surge by providing 30 billion dollars**
**Press TV 5/28/10** (“Senate passes funding for Afghan surge”, http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=128126&sectionid=3510203) 

The US Senate has… to the war-ravaged country. 


**__Advantage 1 is International Law –__**

**Presence in Afghanistan only serves to be a detrimental force – anti-americanism and terrorism are rising, human rights are being questioned by horrid abuse, and civilian casualties are at an all time high – all thanks to US occupation**
**Jensen 8/13/10** (Robert, journalism professor at the University of Austin, board member of the Third Coast Activist Resource Center, Author, “What Happens if We Stay in Afghanistan”, http://mwcnews.net/focus/letters-to-editors/4490-what-happens-if-we-stay-in-afghanistan.html) 
The August 9, 2010 issue of … U.S. wars and occupations. 


**There are several implications of this -**

**1st Terrorism – it independently risks extinction**
**Alexander 03**
Yonah Alexander, professor and director of the Inter-University for Terrorism Studies, Washington Times, 8-28-03 
Last week's brutal suicide bombings… and global security concerns. 


**And the threat has high merit –NY bombing proves a high probability**
**Reuters 5/14/10** (“Pakistani Taliban say America will ‘burn’”, http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/16-pakistani+taliban+say+america+will+burn-hs-01) 

The United States is convinced… the American agenda,” he said. 


**The conflict is reverse causal - Directly reducing troop presence will solve the Taliban threat - possible threats to America are only present due to occupying Afghanistan**
**AP 09** (Associated Press, October 7, 2009, “Taliban say they’re no threat to other countries”, http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33213803/) 

Afghanistan's insurgent Taliban… Islamist forces," the statement said. 


**2nd is International Law –**
**Civilian casualties violate international law**
**O’Connell 2009**
(Mary Ellen, Robert and Marion Short professor of Law at the University of Notre Dame Law School and research professor of International Dispute Resolution at the Kroc Institute at Notre Dame University, “Unlawful Killing with Combat Drones: A Case Study of Pakistan, 2004-2009,” Notre Dame Law School Legal Studies Research Paper No. 09-43, SSRN) 

One of the most important rules respecting… injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.‖104 Little information is available as to whether the U.S. takes any precautions when carrying out drone strikes. 


**And, the Geneva Convention is the strongest internal link to international law**
**ICRC 09** (International Committee of the Red Cross, “The Geneva Conventions of 1949”, 3/09, http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/genevaconventions) 

The Geneva Conventions and… whatever nationality they may hold. 


**Attacks against “terrorists” also violate questions of international law**
**Stein 03** (Yael, Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs, “By Any Name Illegal and Immoral”, Accessed June 24, 2010, RA) 
But even if the present situation… grave breach of the law of war. 


**Alternative causalities are irrelevant – this instance is the strongest internal link to uphold international law**
Yael **Stein**, Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs, **‘3** (“By Any Name Illegal and Immoral,” accessed 6-24-10, RA) 
The assassination policy… guidelines detailed in the article. 


**And that solves every major impact**
**Institute for Energy and Environmental Researc**h, (and the Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy, 20**02** (Rule of Power or Rule of Law? An Assessment of U.S. Policies and Actions Regarding Security-Related Treaties, May, http://www.ieer.org/reports/treaties/execsumm.pdf)

**And, only US involvement solves – key to effective international law**
**Institute for Energy and Environmental Research**, (and the Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy, 20**02** (Rule of Power or Rule of Law? An Assessment of U.S. Policies and Actions Regarding Security-Related Treaties, May, http://www.ieer.org/reports/treaties/execsumm.pdf) 
The evolution of international law… and opted out of compliance. 

**Also – promotion of human rights is critical to provide a global democratic framework**

//Whether we agree with… sterling example at home.//


//**Democracy solves nuclear and biological warfare, genocide, and environmental destruction**//
//**Diamond** Hoover Institution, **S**tanford University 19**95,** Larry, December, PROMOTING DEMOCRACY IN THE 1990S, 1p. http://www.carnegie.org//sub/pubs/deadly/diam_rpt.html // 
Nuclear, chemical and biological… security and prosperity can be built. 


**Advantage 2 is Afghanistan Stability:**

**Agriculture is the strongest internal link to Afghanistan stability**
**Vilsack and Rahimi** 5/14/**10** (Tom, Mohammad, Tom Vilsack is the United States secretary of Agriculture, and Mohammad Asif Rahimi is the Afghan minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock, “A secret weapon in Afghanistan: agriculture”, http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-05-13-vilsack14_st_N.htm) 

The secret as to how Afghanistan… its once-vibrant agricultural economy. 


**However, US presence in Afghanistan is destroying various ecosystems, we must act now before it’s too late – plan solves for this**
**Nastui** 5/4/**10** (Matthew, a former U.S. Air Force Captain. He advised on environmental cleanups at Logistics Command regarding the Air Force’s most contaminated bases and depots. He then worked for Bechtel Environmental and was involved in Superfund cleanups across the United States and radiological cleanups at U.S. Department of Energy sites. He later served as a consultant to a group of environmental remediation companies, smelters and waste recyclers, “American Military Burn Pits Pose Risk to Future Generations of Afghans”, http://kabulpress.org/my/spip.php?article9421) 

The instances of environmental… might permit a broader dialog. 


**Troop presence is the strongest internal link to environmental degradation**
**Nastui** 5/4/**10** (Matthew, a former U.S. Air Force Captain. He advised on environmental cleanups at Logistics Command regarding the Air Force’s most contaminated bases and depots. He then worked for Bechtel Environmental and was involved in Superfund cleanups across the United States and radiological cleanups at U.S. Department of Energy sites. He later served as a consultant to a group of environmental remediation companies, smelters and waste recyclers, “American Military Burn Pits Pose Risk to Future Generations of Afghans”, http://kabulpress.org/my/spip.php?article9421) 

The American military presence… no known long-term health effects.” 


**Taking this into perspective – US troops will be heavily located in southern Afghanistan, specifically around Kandahar**
**Farmer** 5/25/**10** (Ben, staff writer for Telegraph.co.uk, “US troops in Afghanistan surpass number in Iraq”, http://kabulpress.org/my/spip.php?article9421) 

Mr Obama has given his… in Afghanistan since 2001. 


**This city is key – it contains millions of people and conflict due to presence only makes the location more vulnerable**
**King** 5/18/**10** (Laura, Los Angeles Times, “Kandahar Afghans fear NATO's indecision on planned offensive may boost violence”, http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2010/05/kandahar_afghans_fear_natos_in.html) 

Western military officials say… they cannot stand in front of every home." 


**Afghan stability is critical to prevent numerous escalatory Central Asian conflicts.**
**Szayna and Oliker ‘03**
(Thomas S., and Olga, Political Scientists – RAND, Faultlines of Conflict in Central Asia and the South Caucasus, http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/2005/RAND_MR1598.sum.pdf) 
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan… South Caucasus conflicts. 


**Contention 3 is solvency –**
**Withdrawing troops is the strongest internal link to check back any Afghanistan conflict – dialogue key**
**Rashid** 5/27/**10** (Ahmed Rashid is one of the most knowledgeable experts on the region. He wrote a world-renowned book about the Taliban and recently published "Descent Into Chaos: How the war against Islamic extremism is being lost in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia." , “America’s Fatal Flaws in Afghanistan”, http://abcnews.go.com/International/afghanistan-talks-taliban-best-option/story?id=10757772&page=4) 
Obama's promise last year… nation with rapacious neighbors. 


**Withdrawing troops solves, it would be the first step to stability in Afghanistan – plan key**
**Steele** 5/4/**10** (Jonathan, staff writer for Guaridan UK, “Afghanistan: is it time to talk to the Taliban?”, http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/04/afghanistan-taliban) 
Even if talks were to… sadly, it seems unlikely. 


**Timetable key – allows for transition to a stabilized government**
**Polk 09** (William, member of the U.S. Policy Planning Council responsible for the Middle East from 1961 to 1965. Subsequently, he was professor of history and director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Chicago and later president of the Adlai Stevenson Institute of International Affairs.
