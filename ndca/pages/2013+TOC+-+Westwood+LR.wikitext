Many federal funds are earmarked outside of locally derived transportation improvement plans, or TIPs now – That unexpected money disrupts Metropolitan Planning Organization, or MPO plans and undermines effective investment

The United States federal government should invest substantial funding directly into the transportation infrastructure components of United States Metropolitan Planning Organization Transportation Improvement Plans in the United States.

<span style="text-align: left;">Contention 3 is Solvency</span>

Substantial federal investment solves and is necessary – The funding it provides empowers MPOs and increases their authority – Trades-off with state control and diversion of funds towards highways at the expense of urban areas

a. Economy is resilient, emerging economies are decoupling, growth recovers fast, and there’s no protectionism or strife from decline
Moisés <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Naím</span>, editor in chief of Foreign Policy, 1/2-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">10</span>, [“It Didn't Happen,” Foreign Policy, [[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/01/04/it_didnt_happen?page=full]]]
Just a few months ago, the consensus among influential thinkers was that the economic
AND
things are pretty predictable." No, it turns out: They aren't.

b. Protectionism doesn’t cause escalation to significant conflicts
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Guoqiang 9</span> (Long, Director of Foreign Economic Relations at China’s State Council, http://www.eeo.com.cn/ens/finance_investment/2009/03/06/131493.shtml)
I don't think we'll end up with a trade war. Countries mostly adopt protectionist
AND
bilateral negotiation process. It just becomes more intense during times of crisis.

3. No infrastructure internal –

a. US infrastructure leads the world – Size of US makes it extra advanced
Charles <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Lane</span>, journalist and editor who is an editorial writer for The Washington Post and a regular guest on Fox News Channel, 10-31-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">11</span>, [“The U.S. infrastructure argument that crumbles upon examination,” Washington Post, [[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-us-infrastructure-argument-that-crumbles-upon-examination/2011/10/31/gIQAnILRaM_story.html]]] E. Liu
For all its shortcomings, U.S. infrastructure is still among the most
AND
1998, except for 2001, when the mark was D-plus.

b. Insufficient capital to solve the infrastructure deficit
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wahba, 11</span> --- chief investment officer and global head of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure (1/25/2011, Sadek, The Washington Times, “The state of the union's roads, rails, bridges; Reforming fed's approach to building infrastructure,” Factiva, JMP)
The question is, what to do about it? The Obama administration has been
AND
capital - doesn't come close to the ASCE's estimate of the infrastructure deficit.

c. LA proves even transportation dependent places adapt to infrastructure closure
Nate <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Berg</span>, staff writer at The Atlantic Cities, 10-1-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">12</span>, [“Once Again, Carmageddon II Was Practically a Non-Issue,” The Atlantic Cities, [[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2012/10/once-again-carmageddon-ii-was-practically-non-issue/3457/]]] E. Liu
Despite, or perhaps as a result of the widespread public outreach campaign focused on
AND
's Carmageddon II was, once again, hardly an issue at all.

4. Even if the NIB increase popular perception of banking, that is not sufficient to increase trading or deposits especially when the NIB itself doesn’t make loans to businesses or take deposits

5. No stimulus internal –

a. Stimulus jobs are poached, not created, and companies just make people work harder
Garrett <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Jones</span>, Assistant Professor of Economics and Senior Scholar at the Mercatus Center <span style="font-size: 13pt;">and</span> Daniel M. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Rothschild</span>, researcher at the Mercatus Center, 9-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">11</span>, [“No such thiNg as shovel ready: the supply side of the recovery act,” Mercatus Center at George Mason University, mercatus.org/publication/no-such-thing-shovel-ready] E. Liu
Perhaps, one might say, those other companies whose workers were poached ultimately hired
AND
people from unemployment was more the exception than the rule in our interviews.

b. Infrastructure is slow and doesn’t create jobs – Efficiency, not labor intensive and empirics
Michael J. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Boskin</span>, Regular Columnist for The Economists’ Voice. He is T.M. Friedman Professor of Economics and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow, Stanford University. He chaired the President’s Council of Economic Advisers from 1989-1993 , 3-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">12</span>, [“Fiscal Policy for Economic Growth,” The Economists’ Voice, http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ev March, 2012] E. Liu
President Obama in his new stimulus pro- posals has been emphasizing infrastructure spending and
AND
occurring well after it is most needed and likely to be most effective.

6. Business confidence turn –

a. Deficit from stimulus undermines business confidence – Taxation also takes out spending solvency
David M. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Schizer</span>, Dean and Lucy G. Moses Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, 10-17-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">11</span>, [“Fiscal Policy in an Era of Austerity,” Working Paper No. 408, The Center for Law and Economic Studies Columbia University School of Law, [[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1948692]]] E. Liu
Even if we solve this problem by ensuring that stimulus funds are used only for
AND
it is unlikely to serve as a magic bullet for reviving our economy.

b. That collapses policy certainty necessary for growth – Outweighs infrastructure
Mona <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Charen</span>, nationally syndicated columnist, 7-20-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">12</span>, [“The Most Business-Despising President in History,” Real Clear Politics, [[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/07/20/the_most_business-despising_president_in_history_114852.html]]] E. Liu
President Obama's "you didn't build it" gaffe just defined the 2012 campaign.
AND
welfare and disability recipients swell. Trillion dollar deficits degrade our bond rating.

7. They don’t solve – the plan text just has the federal government increase investment thorugh a bank – this links to the explanation he gives in the 1ac cx of the way status quo banks fund infrastructure being bad. Don’t let them shift it to being an NIB – they wrote the plan text incorrectly and did not include a term of art.
Steel

1. Steel decline is inevitable due to inability to compete but MAP-21 solves now
Thomas <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Gibson</span> and Thomas <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dancjek</span> (Thomas Gibson and President and CEO, American Iron and Steel Institute, Thomas Dancjek, President, Steel Manufacturers Association and Roger Ferch, President, American Institute of Steel Construction) 1/23/<span style="font-size: 13pt;">12</span>
(“Blog: Rebuilding America With US - Not Chinese Steel”, [[http://www.cnbc.com/id/46101163/Blog_Rebuilding_America_With_US_Not_Chinese_Steel]]) chip
In his recent blog post,“To Make the U.S. Stronger,
AND
seriously deal with trade law violations, Buy America provisions will be needed.

2. Steel not important for US hegemony- The industry hypes its own importance
(Richard A. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">McCormack,</span> Richard McCormack is editor and publisher of Manufacturing & Technology News , April 17, 200<span style="font-size: 12pt;">9</span>, Manufacturing and technology news volume 16, no. 9 “Defense Department To The U.S. Specialty Metals Industry: We Don’t Need You”)
The health and wellbeing of the U.S. specialty metals industry is not
AND
action to ensure a long-term domestic supply of these specialty metals.”
3. No relationship between US capabilities and peace
Christopher J. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Fettweis</span>, Professor of national security affairs @ U.S. Naval War College, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">10</span>, [“Threat and Anxiety in US Foreign Policy,” Survival, Volume 52, Issue 2 April 2010 , pages 59 – 82//informaworld]
One potential explanation for the growth of global peace can be dismissed fairly quickly:
AND
to reach the conclusion that world peace and US military expenditure are unrelated.

4. Internal decline, external growth and weakening of alliances undermine US influence now
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Walt 12</span> (Stephen M Walt, Robert and Renée Belfer professor of international affairs at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, PhD in political science from the University of California at Berkeley, BA in international relations from Stanford University, co-editor of the Cornell Studies in Security Affairs, co-chair of the editorial board of International Security, member of the editorial boards of Foreign Policy, Security Studies, Journal of Cold War Studies, and International Security, fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, resident associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, guest scholar at the Brookings Institute, 1-26-12, “Whether or not the US is Declining is the Wrong Question,” [[http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/01/26/asking_the_wrong_question_about_the_us_and_china]]) GZ
Instead, the real issue is whether developments at home and overseas are making it
AND
state, its ability to get its way in world affairs is declining.
5. Retrenchment will be peaceful --- no transition wars.
<span style="text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Parent and MacDonald 11</span> (Joseph Parent, Assistant professor at the University of Miami, Paul Macdonald, Assistant professor at Williams college, “Graceful decline? The surprising success of Great Power Retrenchment” pages 1-10, 2011, MIT press journal, http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00034)</span></span>
In fact, when states fall in the hierarchy of great powers, peaceful retrenchment
AND
none of the declining powers that failed to retrench recovered their relative position.

6. Allies solve for the risk of conflicts and none are coming now
Doug <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bandow</span>, senior fellow at the Cato Institute. A former special assistant to Ronald Reagan, 1-31-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">11</span>, [“Solving the Debt Crisis: A Military Budget for a Republic,” CATO Institute, [[http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/solving-debt-crisis-military-budget-republic]]] E. Liu
More than two decades after the Cold War dramatically ended, the U.S
AND
populous allies are capable of promoting peace and stability in their own regions.
