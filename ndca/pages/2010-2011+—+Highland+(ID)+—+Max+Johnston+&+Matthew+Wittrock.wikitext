<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; text-transform: uppercase;">Contention 1: Call of Duty </span>**</span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; text-transform: uppercase;">Let me tell you a story about my Uncle Sam. He’s pretty famous. You’ve probably heard of him, even if you haven’t met him in person. I get along with him alright, but I’m not blind to his major character flaws either. He tends to get a bit belligerent with his opinions sometimes. And yes, he’s not exactly the most inclusive or tolerant person. But I think that everyone will agree that my Uncle Sam’s biggest problem has always been his proclivity towards violence. That was before he bought Call of Duty. Now he can’t get off the couch. He just sits in the dark, in his underwear, eating cheetohs and drinking diet coke. His eyes are red and glazed from the ever-present glow of the television screen. He barely even blinks. He never goes outside. He channels all that aggression into the war games he plays on his Xbomb. It’s not violent. It’s a simulation. It’s a game. He’s not killing people. He’s eliminating targets. Screens, not screams. Buttons, not bombs. Royakkers and van Est explain: </span>**</span>

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; text-transform: uppercase;">Now that I think about it, I don’t think Uncle Sam is better off the way he is. Where do we draw the line between reality and virtual reality? According to Peter Singer, “<span class="underline">__when faced with a dispute or crisis, policymakers have typically regarded the use of force as the “option of last resort.” Unmanned systems might now help that option move up the list, with each upward step making war more likely”.

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-transform: uppercase;">**<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our plan represents a shift in the way that we, as individuals, relate to violence.

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; text-transform: uppercase;">What Max and I are really trying to say is that the threat of nuclear war isn’t any more real to us than missiles are to the playstation warriors that drop them on Kabul. It’s not about bombs, it’s about balluots. It’s about winning the race to nuclear war. We can’t afford these kind of simulations anymore—not in debate, and certainly not in the real world. The dominant discourse of policymaking, in war, in peace, in policy debate, makes violence less real. There is no face to face interaction with people from other places. The topic countries are little more than coordinates on a map. Have you ever played Risk? Moving your soldiers from one brightly colored country to the next? Doesn’t it remind you of the resolution this year? I’m not sure that’s a comparison we should feel comfortable with. After all, militarism isn’t a game. </span>**</span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">**<span style="text-transform: uppercase;">At the end of the day, debate is nothing more than a space in which we accept or reject certain values, ideas and truth claims. We will always win that debate is a place where a person can construct their political and ethical relationship to the world. If this is the primary purpose of debate, then we think that this debate should be about which team best relates to violence. We think that the dominant discourse of policymaking renders violence abstract and benign, making it more likely to occur and escalate. In contrast, the affirmative rejects mediatized versions of war that distance the killer from the killed and make large-scale violence easy to commit with a clean conscious. Your ballot might not “solve” problems in the traditional debate-sense, but we don’t really think that’s what debate is about. Even if we did decide to pretend to be policymakers, this debate would never change anything with regards to nuclear war, poverty, bird flu, terrorism, economic collapse or global warming. But it //can// change how we think about violence—we can choose</span>**<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"> **to ignore it, or, we can choose to see it.** </span></span>

==State Affirmative== 

Contention 1 is the Status Quo
The Political Landscape of the Middle East hasn’t just been reformed, its been Radically transformed. Protests have spread outwards from Tunisia to Egypt, morocco, Iran, Libya, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. Victories in Ousting Ali-Abdullah Saleh in Tunisia as well as Hosni Mubarack in Egypt have opened the door for a democratic domino effect across the entire Middle East. Its become clear that US intervention based strategies of Democracy Promotion are not only unsuccessful but are also propping up regimes that mirror dictatorships. We can see that democracy must build from the bottom up without foreign control
And Iraq is in a position to be the next domino in this chain of events in the common drive for true democracy in the Middle East Robert Dreyfus March 9th 2011 explains

Contention 2 is the Harms of the Status Quo 
The US Presence props up a corrupt regime, as well as taints Iraq’s attempts to create a true, free democracy, as long as the US Stays it will cause the protests to fail and the corrupt regime to stay in place

We’ll isolate one advantage to our Affirmative: Iraqi Democracy

And, There is no one size fits all Democracy, We cant force Iraq to accept our form of democracy, we have to allow them to form it, that’s the entire premise of democracy

</span></span>
And, we have a moral obligation to allow the Iraqi people to form their own state, Democracy is only truly a democracy if the people have made it and control it, Egypt, Lybia, Tunisia, the landscape may not be pretty but neither was the revolutionary war for America, Democracy is not an easy road, but that’s no excuse not to try, We must allow Iraq to transition itself. The US constantly tries to its own military objectives before others, that’s a strategy that needs to end

And These protests have moved beyond the previous problems that plagued Iraq including Islamic radicalism and terrorist campaigns.
