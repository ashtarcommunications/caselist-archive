A SPACE ELEVATOR WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ANYTHING BUILT BEFORE it-the cost of the pyramids, the collesuem, andTHE COLOSSUS all pale in comparison

space is key to break out of the cycle of the restricted economics of Earth—the only way that capitalist growth can be spent is either on making weapons or the glorious expenditure of space projects

We must replace our notion of restricted economic systems ruled by scarcity with a broader notion of the general economy, where excess and expenditure are the prime drivers—failure to break out into the general economy will lead to nuclear war and massive ecological destruction

And, space solves the transition to a general economy best—glorious expenditure on the space elevator will refract back down to earth, creating novel and creative relations to our economic conditions on earth

Space travel creates a paradigm shift in scientific thought—it shifts us away from the traditional views of scarcity and restricted economy by requiring new modes of knowledge production

<span style="text-decoration: none;">Unfortunately, Bataille’s theory of the solar economy is only HALF correct—it fails to account for Earth’s reliance on the concentrated energy of fossil fuels which will inevitably run out</span>

Finally, a space elevator solves this last and only check on general economics—it overcomes the chemistry of rockets and creates an excessive supply of solar energy
