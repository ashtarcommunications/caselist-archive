I'll try to put everything we read up but I can't guarantee I'll remember/be motivated enough to remember. If we read something against you/I forget to put something up/there's some card you can't access that you'd like to see/whatever, shoot me (Dustin) an email at [[mailto:dustml94@gmail.com|dustml94@gmail.com]] and I'll be happy to get it up ASAP. I'll be able to respond a lot quicker if you give me the round/other team's name/kitten pictures/compliments on my hats/tournament name/judge.
