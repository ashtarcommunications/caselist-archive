**Vinay Pai** : David Herman is, without a doubt, the most noble and most generous wiki user in the debate community. The speed and effectiveness with which he responded to my cite request was stunning; I very nearly creamed mine pantaloons. Zach Rosenthal, cuteness aside, cannot dream to match up to Mr. Herman's wiki prowess, or the sheer artistry with which he fulfills cite requests. If you would like to validate the accuracy of this testimonial, or you're just looking for a good time, please call Mr. Jordan Trafton at 925-588-1323.


**Evan McCarty (badass):** Whenever I'm sitting at home alone and have nothing to do, I go to GDS HS's wiki. It just makes me feel so good about humanity, seeing how devoted to disclosure they are. Their wiki also has the suffix "-gasm" appear on it, which is the suffix of another word that I very much enjoy


**Matt Harkins aka SpankDaddy** : lol
i've had a change of heart on the wiki war
few reasons
1. length matters- although zach may have a bigger card amount, yours is longer, which, although I'm no expert, is generally accepted as preferrable
2. your wiki has zero mentions of zizek, whereas z-ro has 12
3. if you scroll down your page really fast, foucault's face appears out of the letters
4. There's a suprise party going on in your wiki, and spank daddy loves can't resist a party
even if zach had a party on his wiki, the feminist authors would probably crash it and kill my game

==TOC - Super-ethics (and racism)== 

**Contention 1 is the ethics of exit –**

**65 years ago, the US colonized Okinawa – to this date, more than half of our military presence in Japan remains stationed there**
**Bandow, 10** -- Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, former Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan and Senior Policy Analyst in the 1980 Reagan for President Campaign, holds a B.A. in Economics from Florida State University and a J.D. from Stanford University (2010, Doug, National Interest Online, “Get Out of Japan,” http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=23592)
When World War II ended, the U.S. occupied Japan… for everyone except the people who live there.

**The United States occupied Japan in the wake of one of the most racially charged war efforts of the 20th century. US soldiers that had been conditioned to equate every Japanese person with an image of a buck-toothed savage now occupied the streets in order to liberate the Japanese from themselves. Basing in Okinawa is steeped in racism, relegating the under-civilzied Okinawans to a position of inferiority.**
**Koshiro, 99** - visiting associate professor of history at Colgate University for 2003–2004, and she has also taught at Williams College and Bates College in recent years (Yukiko, “Trans-Pacific racisms and the U.S. occupation of Japan,” http://books.google.com/books?id=CaeyOTMMjPYC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=The+socio+cultural+transformation+of+Japan+into+an+Americanized+nation+did+not+remove+this+wall.+In+Japanese-American+interactions,+racism+was+implacable.&source=bl&ots=xcKv8ggzbB&sig=eaOF6xfDK6XpgfCdUARCJDbdq_M&hl=en&ei=Q73NTMMTw5yWB4Cp2eQI&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=okinawa&f=false)

The situation for Okinawans was different from… repatriate like the peoples of Japan’s former colonies.

**Scenario 1 is racism –**

**And racism enables the political bodies of the US and Japan to systematically ignore Okinawa for the sake of the greater good**
**Feifer, 1** - author of many successful books, including Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa, a New York Times Notable Book; Moscow Farewell, a Book of the Month Club Main Selection; and The Girl from Petrovka, the basis of a Hollywood film. He's written for a wide variety of publications, including the New Republic, the New York Times Magazine, Harper's, and the Saturday Evening Post (8/1, George, “The Battle of Okinawa: The Blood and the Bomb,” http://books.google.com/books?id=t7iFc6JCHKcC&pg=PA455&dq=okinawa+%2B+racism&hl=en&ei=5VnATNGlLIqr8Aady5ngBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=okinawa%20%2B%20racism&f=false)

For all the recent decline in overt racism, for all… good people of, say, Long Island or Dade Country.

**The globalization of racial hierarchies relegate difference to the realm of invisibility culminating in exclusion and extermination.**
**Rodriguez, 7** - University of California, Riverside (Dylan, “american globality and the u. s. prison regime: state violence and white supremacy from abu ghraib to stockton to bagong diwa” Kritika Kultura, Issue 9, November 2007)

Variable, overlapping, and mutually constituting white… and mobilization across global geographies.

**And racism makes war and violence inevitable – it presents our enemies as biologically inferior to justify their extermination**
**Mendieta 2** - (4/25/02, Eduardo Mendieta, PhD and Associate professor of Stonybrook School of Philosophy, “ ‘To make live and to let die’ –Foucault on Racism Meeting of the Foucault Circle, APA Central Division Meeting”)

This is where racism intervenes, not from without… then these threat and foes are biological in nature.

**Finally, inaction is complicity - you have a unique obligation to reject racism**
**Memmi, 2k** - Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ University of Paris (Albert-; RACISM, translated by Steve Martinot, pp.163-165)

The struggle against racism will be long, difficult… is a wager, but the stakes are irresistible.

**Scenario 2 is ethics–**

**And the racial origins of this relationship have justified oppression on both sides of the Pacific. Japan views Okinawas as inferior and the US treats them as expendable creating Okinawa as the absolute other.**
**Koshiro, 99** - visiting associate professor of history at Colgate University for 2003–2004, and she has also taught at Williams College and Bates College in recent years (Yukiko, “Trans-Pacific racisms and the U.S. occupation of Japan,” http://books.google.com/books?id=CaeyOTMMjPYC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=The+socio+cultural+transformation+of+Japan+into+an+Americanized+nation+did+not+remove+this+wall.+In+Japanese-American+interactions,+racism+was+implacable.&source=bl&ots=xcKv8ggzbB&sig=eaOF6xfDK6XpgfCdUARCJDbdq_M&hl=en&ei=Q73NTMMTw5yWB4Cp2eQI&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=okinawa&f=false)

The situation for Okinawans was different from that… like the peoples of Japan’s former colonies.

**This has produced Okinawans as the quintessential other – the dual relationship between the US and Japan makes their suffering invisible.**
**Taylor, NO DATE** – asst. professor, Ph.D Geography Department, California State University, Fullerton (Jonathan, “Anti-Military and Environmental Movements in Okinawa,” http://www.uky.edu/~ppkaran/conference/Anti-Military%20and%20Environmental%20Movements%20in%20Okinawa.pdf)

It is important to recognize the tremendous impacts this battle… strength of Okinawan anti-base and peace movements.

**Intimate societies absolve actors of any constraints, sanctioning endless violence against the excluded other.**
**Levinas, 98** -- philosopher and Talmudic commentator (Emmanuel, also: Mihael Bradley Smith, Barbara Harshav, “Entre nous: thinking-of-the-other,” http://books.google.com/books?id=u13lXZIO3QcC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=%22intimate+society%22+violence&source=bl&ots=BzPYpJW
WpS&sig=ZYD3AiuQILmDoETtiZm5I7pGn_w&hl=en&ei=ouR7TOiQFYKClAfQ2JjsCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22intimate%20society%22%20violence&f=false)

The forgiveable transgression, apart from its magical significance… it is beyond forigveness,but because it does not belong to the order of forgiveness.

**We are ethically obligated to end this violence – the victimization of Okinawa represents a horrific instance of ongoing oppression.**
**Gerson, 3** – (12/5/03, Joseph Gerson, PhD, is deeply involved in the U.S. peace and anti-war movement and participated in the founding conferences of United for Peace and Justice, The Asia Peace Assembly, and the European Network for Peace and Human Rights, “U.S. Foreign Military Bases & Military Colonialism,” http://www.zcommunications.org/u-s-foreign-military-bases-and-military-colonialism-by-joseph-gerson)

My awakening to the meanings and impacts of bases, their missions… of the President's strategy is our strong forward presence."

**And in the context of Okinawa, a Levinasian approach is essential.**
**Inoue, 7** -- Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from Duke University and assistant professor of the Japan Studies Program and the Department of Modern and Classical Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at the University of Kentucky. Visiting Associate Professor in the Department of Engineering of the Shibaura Institute of Technology (4/15, Masamichi S., “Okinawa and the U.S. Military: Identity Making in the Age of Globalization)

These two political and conceptual problems in the postmodern/colonial/structural… of Self and Other will never be able to fully internalize.

**Withdrawal forces a reckoning with human suffering, humbling virulent national identity and renewing responsibility for a history of violence**
**Koschmann, 1** -- teaches modern Japanese history at Cornell University. He published Revolution and Subjectivity in Postwar Japan (University of California Press) in 1996, and has coedited Total War and "Modernization" (Cornell East Asia Series 100, 1998) (2001, J. Victor, The South Atlantic Quarterly, “National Subjectivity and the Uses of Atonement in the Age of Recession,” muse)

Philosopher Takahashi Tetsuya responded to Kato in March… able to construct [the subject called] "we Japanese." <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.uchicago.edu/journals/south_atlantic_quarterly/v099/99.4koschmann.html#FOOT24|24]]</span>

**Subjecting the atrocities of militarism in Okinawa to public scrutiny reformulates social movements in opposition to this violence.**
**Macleish, 10** - KENNETH T. MACLEISH doctoral candidate in anthropology and the Program in Folklore, Public Culture and Cultural Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. He conducted 12 months of intensive fieldwork with soldiers and military families at and around the U.S. Army’s Ft. Hood in Killeen, TX. 5/6/ 2010 (Review of “The Bases of Empire: The Global Struggle against U.S. Military Posts” American Ethnologist Volume 37, Issue 2, pages 385–386, May 2010)

Just as it is both moving and unsettling… of state power and legitimate violence.

**That’s key to adopt an ethic of care towards the other – all action and calculation is determined by our interactions with the other**
**Hofmeyer, 9** – researcher in the Department of Philosophy of the University of Pretoria, South Africa. She holds a PhD in Philosophy from the Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands (1/28, Benda, “Radical Passivity: Rethinking Ethical Agency in Levinas,” http://books.google.com/books?id=vjbXfNltSh0C&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=levinas+radical+appropriation&source=bl&ots=u7xjTpQAz2&sig=97L2HyQTWm-E-71KKfUGjJy8QfI&hl=en&ei=0l5pTI_FJ8OqlAeq9eGeBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=levinas%20radical%20appropriation&f=false)

To fix the distinctiveness of the face that faces one from… but it is I who must respond to it with all my resources.

**Our recognition of moral responsibility eliminates the impetus for violence by forcing us to realize the humanity of the other**
**Dews, 7** -professor of philosophy at the University of Essex (Peter, “The Idea of Evil,” Blackwell Publishing LTD, 2007)

The face, then, is not an object, but the… discovers itself murderous in its very exercise.

**Two-level utilitarianism solves all your offense**
**Hamilton, 3** - (2003, Christopher, “Understanding Philosophy for AS Level,” googlebooks)

There is, however, a problem with this version of utilitarianism… such principles clash that we should try to think like an archangel.

**Utilitarianism is inherently arbitrary and cannot be calculated rationally – the greater good is always subject to interpretation.**
**Mcallister, No Date** (Christopher, “Towards the Bright Horizon,” chapter 4, http://christophermcallister.org/towards-the-bright-horizon/consequentialism-from-a-to-b)

A consequentialist is one who evaluates morally-significant… death if he so wishes and, if he has, what grounds it?

**And our moral system is an internal link turn to consequentialism—only by following deontological moral rules can we maximize the good**
**Alexander, 85** - (Larry, “Pursuing the Good-Indirectly,” Ethics, Vol. 95, No. 2 (Jan., 1985), pp. 315-332, University of Chicago Press)

The best argument for indirect consequentialism… likelihood that it maximizes the Good.

**Contention 2 is solvency –**

**Acquiescence to the demands of Okinawa undermines the system of racism and imperialism**
**Roberson, 9** - Professor of Cultural Anthropology at Tokyo Jogakkan College (Winter, James E., “Memory and Music in Okinawa: The Cultural Politics of War and Peace,” http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.uchicago.edu/journals/positions/v017/17.3.roberson.html)

A song such as this indexes complex ironies… unheard by the Japanese and American governments.

**Our refusal to sacrifice Okinawa is a recognition of the shared precariousness of life. A critical intervention into the norms of representation opens up space for a new ethical-political strategy that precedes calculation.**
**Butler, 9** (Judith, Prof of Rhetoric at Berkeley, “Frames of War”)

It is precisely within an ongoing contestation over… effect of such modes of sovereignty is precisely to "lose the you."

**The affective enounter with the other must come before the formation of political frameworks. Ethics cannot be translated rationally.**
**Nealon, 98** --- PHD Ph.D., M.A. Loyola University  (Nealon, Jeffrey T. Alterity Politics: Ethics and Performative Subjectivity. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1998. Questia. 12 July 2009 Pgs, 33-36 Chapter “The Ethics of Dialogue: Bakhtin's Answerability and Levinas's Responsibility”)

Although Levinas's work is becoming more… of my spontaneity by the presence of the other" ( Totality, 43).

**Contention 3 – no disads—**

**Multiple factors make great power wars impossible.**
**Gelb, 10** – (Dec. 2010, Leslie H. Gelb, PhD, President Emeritus and Board Senior Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations, “GDP Now Matters More Than Force: A US Foreign Policy for the Age of Economic Power,” http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66858/leslie-h-gelb/gdp-now-matters-more-than-force?page=show)

Also reducing the likelihood of conflict… they rarely oppose one another in explosive situations.

**The international system prevents nuclear war--economic, military, and ideological trends have changed.**
**Fettweiss 03** – (Christopher Fettweiss, April prof security studies - naval war college, Comparative Strategy 22.2 April 2003 p 109-129)

Mackinder can be forgiven for failing to anticipate… has brought about the end of major, great power war.40

**Political calculations are impossible - even experts are unreliable**
**Menand, 5** (Louis, Everybody's An Expert, The Newyorker, December 5th, Tetlock - Psychology Professor @ Berkley <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/05/051205crbo_books1?currentPage=1]]</span>)

It is the somewhat gratifying lesson of Philip Tetlock’s new… colleagues who eked out existences far from the limelight.”


==TOC - Hiroshima== 

**Contention 1 is the dawn of an era:**

**The disaster at Fukushima has afforded a unique opportunity to reckon with the danger of nuclear entanglements in Japan – the nuclear umbrella represents the logic that allowed the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.**
**Oe, 3/28** – 1994 Nobel Prize Winner in literature (2011, Kenzaburo, “History Repeats,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2011/03/28/110328ta_talk_oe]]</span>)

This disaster unites, in a dramatic way, two phenomena… deterrence that is advocated by nuclear powers.

**Now is key – we must have a reckoning with Japan’s nuclear past – nuclear umbrella is the primary starting point**
**Kuznick 4/13** – (Peter, bulletin of atomic scientists “Japan's nuclear history in perspective: Eisenhower and atoms for war and peace” http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/japans-nuclear-history-perspective-eisenhower-and-atoms-war-and-peace)

The price of denial. While Americans were preparing… antinuclearism following the horrors of World War II.

**The nuclear umbrella casts the sigificance of the bomb in strategic rather than commemorative terms – the grand narative of American power has created a hegemonic monopoly on our historical memory.**
**Hong, 9** - Chancellor's postdoctoral fellow in English at UC Berkeley (11/1, Christine, “Flashforward Democracy: American Exceptionalism and the Atomic Bomb in Barefoot Gen,” muse)

I focus on the reception of Hersey's "Hiroshima"… as cultural, to US geopolitical dominance over Japan.

**Nuclear umbrella politics sanitizes the memory of Hiroshima.**
**Yoneyama, 99** - B.A. in German Language Studies and M.A. in International Relations at Sophia University, Tokyo, and Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology at Stanford University, California (Lisa, “Hiroshima Traces: Time, Space, and the Dialects of Memory,” http://books.google.com/books?id=HlH0xxj84CwC&pg=PA24&dq=nuclear+umbrella+%2B+memory+of+hiroshima&hl=en&ei=d6-MTdytAsTAgQfln9XEDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false)

All three examples – the controversy over the cenotaph epigraph… pan-Asian regime of truth to the U.S. cold war commonwealth.

**And squo nuclear debates are locked in an epistemological regime of truth that prevents alternative voices from being heard.**
**Manoff, 84** (Karl, Managing Editor of Harpers in a speech given to physicians for social Responsibility, "the media: nuclear secrecy vs democracy" bulletin of atomic scientists, googlebooks)

Writers such as Kurihara continued to create under the… different consequences for social action and political participation.

**We’ll isolate a few impacts:**

**First, current US nuclear policy is counterproductive, inherently violent, and makes proliferation and nuclear use inevitable – we are obligated to end the immoral practice of nuclear deterrence.**
**Kazuo, 9** – Japanese Communist Party Chair speech to the International Meeting of the 2009 World Conference (8/3, Shii, “Japan must break away from U.S. nuclear umbrella and become nuclear-free,” http://www.jcp.or.jp/english/jps_weekly09/20090804_01.html)

A new situation is emerging in the world towards… for a “nuclear-free Japan” in name and reality.

**Specifically, the detachment from a commemorative relationship with Hiroshima locks us into a mindset of violence and makes endless nuclear war inevitable.**
**Lifton and Mitchell, 96** (Psychologist at Harvard Medical School AND Editor of E and P and author of 9 books, Hiroshima in America, 302)

Since Hiroshima, we have been captives of nuclear… world of total insecurity, as Lewis Mumford observed.

**Second, our obsession with the bomb is rooted in a faux rationality that justifies violence through the logic of preventing apocalypse. Our interrogation of hiroshima can deconstruct the irresistability of nuclear desire.**
**Davis, 1** – Professor Emeritus, Ohio State University, Ph.D: U of C, English language and literature (Walter A., “Deracination: historicity, Hiroshima, and the tragic imperative,” gbooks)

That is why the Bomb provides an “object” irresistible… give history a “goal” and to exorcize or limit contingency.

**The impact is endless violence, misery, and destruction of all value to life.**
**Nandy 97** – (PhD in clinical psychology and Director, Center for the Study of Developing Socieities, 1997, Ashis. http://www.transnational.org/forum/meet/nandy_nuclearism.html)

Nuclearism does not remain confined to the nuclear… already dead morally, socially and psychologically.

**Thus Isaac and I advocate the following plan:**

**The United States federal government should withdraw its nuclear umbrella from Japan.**

**Contention 2 is the end of an era:**

**The plan functions as a sustained criticism of current US nuclear policy. An interrogation of the events preceding and following from the use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki can provide the critical force necessary to reorient our understanding of nuclear weapons**
**Davis, 1** – Professor Emeritus, Ohio State University, Ph.D: U of C, English language and literature (Walter A., “Deracination: historicity, Hiroshima, and the tragic imperative,” gbooks)

For several reasons, Hiroshima presents an ideal forum… modernism, Hiroshima the inaugural postmodern act.

**Our interrogation of the violent nature of memory surrounding Hiroshima is the duty of engaged intellectuals. There is no middle ground – either you are raising hell or you are complicit in the extinction of humanity.**
**Hayer, 94** – (“A World of Corpses,” Positions)

What I have tried to say in this essay and… therefore be realistic and demand the impossible.

**And this is specifically true in the context of nuclear history.**
**Davis 01** – Walter Davis, Ph.D. 1969 The University of Chicago (with Distinction), English Language and Literature, Emphases: Literary Theory, Modern Literature M.A. 1966 Marquette University (with Honors) English Language and Literature B.A. 1964 Marquette University (Cum Laude) Double Major: English and Philosophy March 2002-Present: Professor Emeritus, The Ohio State University, Department of English September 1988-2002: Professor, The Ohio State University, Department of English September 1977-June 1988: Associate Professor, The Ohio State University, Department of English September 1969-June 1977: Assistant Professor, The University of California at Santa Barbara, Department of English, Deracination: Historiocity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic, pg. 197.

The image thereby reveals what perception cannot… joy, dread—in the human face and the human deed.

**Finally, our act of remembrance is key to recognize the shared precariousness of life. A critical intervention into the norms of representation opens up space for a new ethical-political strategy that precedes calculation.**
**Butler, 9** (Judith, Prof of Rhetoric at Berkeley, “Frames of War”)

It is precisely within an ongoing contestation… one effect of such modes of sovereignty is precisely to "lose the you."

**Contention 3 is don’t go for deterrence:**

**END is dead and done – self serving policy that defeats its own ends and encourages nuclear secrecy and violations of the NPT – makes violence and prolif inevitable.**
**Rovere 11** – (2/22/11, Crispin, PhD Candidate at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, ANU, Lowy Institute for International Policy, “Bringing an end to extended nuclear deterrence,” http://lowyinterpreter.org/post/2011/02/22/Bringing-an-end-to-extended-nuclear-deterrence.aspx)

The US uses END as its justification for maintaining… biggest threats to nuclear disarmament worldwide.

**Costs are too high and there is no real incentive for America to interevene – the umbrella alone isn’t enough of a a guarantee to dissuade conflict.**
**White 11** – (2/3/11, Hugh, Visiting Fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy and Professor of Strategic Studies at the Australian National University, “Extended deterrence: A game of bluff,” Lowy Institute, http://lowyinterpreter.org/post/2011/02/03/Extended-deterrence-A-game-of-bluff.aspx)

But these are not the tough cases. The real question… yet accept this. The sooner they do the better for everyone.

**Refusing to continue our policy of extended nuclear deterrence in East Asia will have a stabilizing effect on the region – removes the incentive for conflict.**
**Hayes, 10** - (12/6/10, Peter Hayes, Professor of International Relations, RMIT University, Melbourne and Executive Director, Nautilus Institute of America, “The US needs a new North Korea policy: a nuclear weapons free zone,”)

Fortunately, there is a policy framework… disarmament, especially guarantees from nuclear weapons states to not target it.

**And the plan can create a new security architecture not based on the destructive influence of nuclear deterrence.**
**Hayes, 09** - (12/10/09, Peter Hayes, Professor of International Relations, RMIT University, Melbourne and Executive Director, Nautilus Institute of America, “Extended nuclear deterrence, Global Abolition and Korea,” Austral Special Report 09-06S, Nautilus Institute)

Moreover, as has been pointed out many times… otherwise antagonistic states, and the need for shared solutions.22

**And North Korean proliferation makes the collapse of our nuclear deterrent inevitable.**
**Hayes, 09** - (12/10/09, Peter Hayes, Professor of International Relations, RMIT University, Melbourne and Executive Director, Nautilus Institute of America, “Extended nuclear deterrence, Global Abolition and Korea,” Austral Special Report 09-06S, Nautilus Institute)

Henceforth, the credibility of US END with allies… far the state held most accountable for these dismal outcomes.

**Contention 4 is no disads:**

**1) The logic of nuclear apocalypse is rooted in a perverse desire to sanitize the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Because the events were so small compared to the potential for extinction, we can divorce our actions from their historical significance.**
**Foard, 97** (JH, JAAR, Prof of Religion at ASU, "Imagining Nuclear Weapons," JSTOR)

This ambivalence about Hiroshima has been partially… as a cultural construct rather than a self evident fact.

===1AC - Wake Tournament=== 

**Thus Isaac and I advocate the following plan: The United States Federal Government should withdraw its military presence from the Okinawa prefecture in Japan**

**Contention 1 is the state and the stateless—**

**65 years ago, the US colonized Okinawa – despite returning it to Japan sovereignty in 1972, more than half of our military presence in Japan remains stationed there**
**Bandow, 6/18** -- Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, former Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan and Senior Policy Analyst in the 1980 Reagan for President Campaign, holds a B.A. in Economics from Florida State University and a J.D. from Stanford University (2010, Doug, National Interest Online, “Get Out of Japan,” http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=23592)

Candidate Barack Obama may have charmed foreign peoples... is convenient for everyone except the people who live there.

**The relationship between the US and Japan is a closed, dualistic relationship that silences Okinawan voices so that they are unable to make determinations about their own social and political issues**
**Inoue, 7** -- Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from Duke University and assistant professor of the Japan Studies Program and the Department of Modern and Classical Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at the University of Kentucky. Visiting Associate Professor in the Department of Engineering of the Shibaura Institute of Technology (4/15, Masamichi S., “Okinawa and the U.S. Military: Identity Making in the Age of Globalization)
These two political and conceptual problems in the postmodern/colonial/structural idea... an excess that the Foucauldian/postmodern model of Self and Other will never be able to fully internalize.

**The SOFA permits us to cause constant disturbances, inflict daily pain on civilians, and pollute the environment with no repercussions for the US**
**Fukumura, 7** – Graduated from UC Santa Cruz, prof: Okinawa Christian University (2007, Yoko, “Okinawa: Effects of Long-Term US Military Presence,” http://www.genuinesecurity.org/partners/report/Okinawa.pdf)
Highly carcinogenic materials (fuels, oils, solvents and heavy metals) are regularly released during military operations... the U.S. government must inform local officials about military operations, but Okinawan people doubt that this is really working.

**That makes Okinawa fundamentally expendable in the eyes of the US and Japan – individual suffering is invisible in the status quo**
**Taylor, NO DATE** – asst. professor, Ph.D Geography Department, California State University, Fullerton (Jonathan, “Anti-Military and Environmental Movements in Okinawa,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://www.uky.edu/~ppkaran/conference/Anti-Military%20and%20Environmental%20Movements%20in%20Okinawa.pdf]]</span>)

It is important to recognize the tremendous impacts this battle... is integral to understanding the enduring strength of Okinawan anti-base and peace movements.

**But instead of taking responsibility for these injustices, the status quo is waging war on the Okinawans, treating them as objects to be manipulated by political elites**
**Deborah Mantle, 06** - (Lecturer in the College of International Relations at Ritsumeikan University (Japan), 2006 (“Defending the Dugong: Redefining ‘Security’ in Okinawa and Japan,” Ritsumeikan Annual Review of International Studies, Volume 5, Available Online at http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/cg/ir/college/bulletin/e-vol.5/MANTLE.pdf, p. 85-86)

The diminishing population of Okinawa dugongs graze the sea grasses... can also be seen in the words and actions of activists and academics living within and outside of Okinawa.

**We’ll isolate 2 impacts—**
**1. The sovereign’s understanding of populations as objects to be manipulated to a desired political end leads to extinction - eventually, all populations will be sacrificed**
**Dean, 1** (Mitchell, Professor of Sociology at Macquarie University in Australia, States of Imagination, Eds: Hansen and Stepputat, (53-56)

Consider again the contrastive terms in which it is possible to view biopolitics and sovereignty... the absolute suicide of the German race” is inscribed, according to Foucault, in the functioning of the modern state (232).

**2. Intimate societies absolve actors of any constraints, sanctioning endless violence against the excluded other**
**Levinas, 98** -- philosopher and Talmudic commentator (Emmanuel, also: Mihael Bradley Smith, Barbara Harshav, “Entre nous: thinking-of-the-other, ”http://books.google.com/booksid=u13lXZIO3QcC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=%22intimate+society%22+violence&source

=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22intimate%20society%22%20violence&f=false)

The forgiveable transgression, apart from its magical significance... not because it is beyond forigveness,but because it does not belong to the order of forgiveness.

**Contention 2 is the environment—**

**Occupation causes pollution and ocean acidity —presence will be the death knell of one of the world’s most sacred ecosystems – multiple reasons**
**CBD, 9** — center for biological diversity: a national, nonprofit conservation organization with more than 240,000 members and online activists dedicated to the protection of endangered species and wild places, co-signed by representatives of conservation, animal protection, and peace and justice groups representing more than 10 million Americans, (2009, “RE: Proposed U.S. Military Air Base Expansion Near Henoko, Okinawa,” Letter To The Obama Administration, December 3rd, Available Online at http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/mammals/Okinawa_dugong/pdfs/dugongletter.pdf)

The island of Okinawa has been called the “Galapagos of the East”... ensure that the Okinawa dugong has a fighting chance at celebrating its importance in 2010 and years to come.

**The impact is extinction - healthy ecosystems are key to sustain human life**
**Craig, 3** - Associate Professor of Law at the Indiana University School of Law, (Robin Kundis, “Taking Steps Toward Marine Wilderness Protection? Fishing and Coral Reef Marine Reserves in Florida and Hawaii,” McGeorge Law Review (34 McGeorge L. Rev. 155), Winter, Available Online via Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)

Biodiversity and ecosystem function arguments for conserving marine ecosystems also exist... More importantly, the Black Sea is not necessarily unique.

**Furthermore, tolerating the destruction of the environment saps us of our humanity—it makes nuclear war and human extinction inevitable**
**Bookchin, 87** - co-founder of the Institute of Social Ecology, (Murray, "An Appeal For Social and Psychological Sanity," The Modern Crisis, Published by Black Rose Books Ltd., ISBN 0920057624, p. 106-108)

Industrially and technologically, we are moving at an ever-accelerating pace toward a yawning chasm... reflects a natural world disempowered of its capacity to reproduce a green and living world.

**Finally, your alt causes are irrelevant – this is the key area**
**Shaw, 5** - journalist, currently freelance, studying in Okinawa on a Fulbright scholarship,
(“Marines and Manatees: A Proposed U.S. Base in Okinawa Threatens Endangered Dugongs”, E-Magazine, Jan/Feb)

When Napoleon Bonaparte was told of the peace-loving Okinawan culture... Tokyo and Washington ganging up on the Okinawans, and there’s not much they can do about it.”


**Contention 3 is solvency—**

**The plan raises the specter of a third to disrupt violent geopolitics**

Indeed, on the basis of their unified yet inclusive positioning of “we are Okinawans,”... identity which would create atomized differences within the intimate society.

**US occupation sustains imperialist ideology that sacrifices invisible populations for the sake of the state’s needs – withdrawal is key**
**Mantle, 6** -- Lecturer in the College of International Relations at Ritsumeikan University (Japan), (2006, Deborah, “Defending the Dugong: Redefining ‘Security’ in Okinawa and Japan,” Ritsumeikan Annual Review of International Studies, Volume 5, Available Online at http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/cg/ir/college/bulletin/e-vol.5/MANTLE.pdf, p. 96-101)

First, and crucially, the international context has changed profoundly... many of those trends emerged explicitly as strategies to empower the disenfranchised.


**Contention 4 is things that are true—**

**Political calculations are impossible - even experts are unreliable**
**Menand, 2k5** (Louis, Everybody's An Expert, The Newyorker, December 5th, Tetlock - Psychology Professor @ Berkley <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/05/051205crbo_books1?currentPage=1]]</span>)

It is the somewhat gratifying lesson of Philip Tetlock’s new book... more overconfident than their colleagues who eked out existences far from the limelight.”

**Deterrence isn’t true - considerations of forward presence are biased to ignore alternate mechanisms that can fill in to prevent foreign aggression**
**Basham, 7** – (3/28/07, Steven L. Basham, Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air Force, “FORWARD MILITARY PRESENCE: A MATTER OF STRATEGIC CULTURE,” US Army War College, http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA469111)

From President Truman on, each subsequent administration confronted an increasingly complex environment... in addition to having an appropriate reserve force in the United States.

**Finally, we must address systemic harms.** **Attempting to start from a position of preventing large-scale violence blinds us and makes war and violence inevitable**

**Mantle, 6** – lecturer, College of International Relations, Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto, Japan (2006, Deborah, “Defending the Dugong: Redefining ‘Security’ in Okinawa and Japan,” http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/cg/ir/college/bulletin/e-vol.5/MANTLE.pdf)

What are the threats to Japan that merit a stronger U.S.......citizens have no redress apart from civil protest and participating in local plebiscites.

**Turn – plan saves deterrence**

**[A whole slew of Bandow cards will then probably materialize]**


==PMCs - NDCA== 

===1AC=== 

**Contention 1 is Impacts First, it’s a new aff:**

**The Taliban is an existential threat.**
**Pitt, 9** – (5/8/09, William, New York Times bestselling author “Unstable Pakistan Threatens the World,” http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=commentary&article=2183)

But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with…world on a collision course with unimaginable disaster.

**Terrorism is an existential threat.**
**Alexander 03** – (8/28/03, Yonah, professor and director of the Inter-University for Terrorism Studies, Washington Times)

Last week's brutal suicide bombings in Baghdad and Jerusalem have once again … For without victory, there is no survival. "

**Instability in Iraq causes Middle East Instability.**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 11pt;">**Biddle 09** – (May 2009, Stephen Biddle, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, “Reversal in Iraq,” google) </span>


While renewed warfare within Iraq’s borders is bad… manage international peace and security at a critical time in its evolution.

**That’s an existential threat.**
**Primakov, 9** [September, Yevgeny, President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation; Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences; member of the Editorial Board of Russia in Global Affairs. This article is based on the scientific report for which the author was awarded the Lomonosov Gold Medal of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2008, “The Middle East Problem
in the Context of International Relations”]

The Middle East conflict is unparalleled in terms of… President Obama’s position does not completely rule out such a possibility.

**Thus the Plan:**

**The United States federal government should withdraw its private military contractors from Iraq and Afghanistan. We’ll clarify…**

**Contention 2 is the Sovereign:**

**The privatization of violence represents the undoing of the Westphalian state order – the globalization of legitimate violence is creating the “new war” in which all restrictions are moot.**
**Wulf 05** – (2005, Herbert, PhD, former Director of the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC) where he is now associated as a Senior Fellow, “The bumpy road to re-establish a monopoly of violence,” http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/HumanSecurityReport/Wulfdraft.pdf DH)

The second reason for the new wars is political… often a fight about political control and the power in states.

**The increasing use of PMC’s is directly tied to the death of the state monopoly on legitimate violence – in a world where violence is privatized, the sovereign no longer controls the experience of the political and war becomes individualized.**
**Krahmann, 09** – (Elke, Senior Lecturer in International Relations, Department of Politics, University of Bristol, “Private Security Companies and the State Monopoly on Violence: A Case of Norm Change?” http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/PRIF_Prvt_Security_and_The%20State_Monopoly_on_Violence.pdf DH)

Altogether, the preceding analysis provides some evidence… these norms through their own discourses and practices.

**PMC’s change the strategic nature of war – violence is no longer the domain of the sovereign and the definition of war becomes unlimited.**
**Krahmann, 09** – (Elke, Senior Lecturer in International Relations, Department of Politics, University of Bristol, “Private Security Companies and the State Monopoly on Violence: A Case of Norm Change?” http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/PRIF_Prvt_Security_and_The%20State_Monopoly_on_Violence.pdf DH)

Finally, the private use of armed force can affect… remain the primary goal of private security guards.

**We’ll isolate a few impacts:**

**First, Sovereign equality forms the basis for jus ad bellum – for the existence of LAW IN WAR. Without the sovereign monopoly on violence, war becomes unlimited and total, necessitating the destruction of the enemy rather than their defeat.**
**Axtmann, 07** – (2007, Roland Axtmann, PhD, Department of Politics and International Relations, School of Humanities, Swansea University, Wales, “Humanity or Enmity? Carl Schmitt on International Politics,” International Politics, 2007, 44, (531–551) DH)

Schmitt situated his critique of the idea of ‘just war’ and… for the bracketing, and thus ‘civilizing’, of war.

**And the sovereign decision regarding violence constitutes the monopoly on its legitimate use. As sovereignty relies on the necessity of this decision, the enemy who brings this decision into being can never be annihilated and war can never become atrocity.**
**Zarmanian, 06** – (Thalin Zarmanian, PhD, International Relations, Professor at the University of Milan, “Carl Schmitt and the Problem of Legal Order: From Domestic to International,” Leiden Journal of International Law, 19 (2006), pp. 41–67, Proquest, DH)

Because of the guaranteeing role that every state… civilian populations during the Second World War.

**Second, the removal of the political from the domain of the sovereign is the negation of the “outside.” In such a world, otherness becomes impossible and the enemy becomes the foe, turning the world of kingdoms into the kingdom of Satan.**
**Prozorov 06** - (2006, Sergei Prozorov, Professor of International Relations at Petrozavodsk State University, “Liberal Enmity: The Figure of the Foe in the Political Ontology of Liberalism,” Millennium – Journal of International Studies, http://mil.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/35/1/75.pdf DH)

For Schmitt, the immanentist orientation of modern… and, thus, will inevitably resist its subjection.

**Third, the denial of the sovereign as the node of violent decision deterritorializes violence and results in a Hobbsian state of war in which all violence poses the threat of annihilation.**
**Zarmanian, 06** – (Thalin Zarmanian, PhD, International Relations, Professor at the University of Milan, “Carl Schmitt and the Problem of Legal Order: From Domestic to International,” Leiden Journal of International Law, 19 (2006), pp. 41–67, Proquest DH)

In the conclusion to Der Nomos der Erde, Schmitt denounced… restrained in order to forestall chaos.

**Contention 3 is the War:**

**The trinitarian war is one in which the state, the army, and the people function in an agonistic balance – the presence of PMC’s in battle upsets that balance and results in the death of the trinity.**
**Wallwork, 05** – (1/2/05, Major Richard D Wallwork, RA British Army, “Operational Implications of Private Military Companies in the Global War on Terror,” School of Advanced Military Studies, United States Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA436294&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf DH)

Martin Van Creveld further exemplifies the… corporations, but is sadly beyond the scope of this monograph.

**And the trinitarian conception of war is key to bracket off civilians and prevent the violence of total war.**
**Kolasi, 10** – (July 2010, Klevis, Lecturer, Albanian Military Academy, “Beyond The “TRINITARIAN WAR”: Reflections on Contemporary Armed Conflicts,” http://www.eurasiacritic.com/articles/beyond-%E2%80%9Ctrinitarian-war%E2%80%9D-reflections-contemporary-armed-conflicts DH)

The influential historian of war Martin van Creveld… solving the inter-state problems in an anarchic international system.

**The loss of trinity has produced an era of asymetric war that has unbracketed war and made it incredibly violent.**
**Kolasi, 10** – (July 2010, Klevis, Lecturer, Albanian Military Academy, “Beyond The “TRINITARIAN WAR”: Reflections on Contemporary Armed Conflicts,” http://www.eurasiacritic.com/articles/beyond-%E2%80%9Ctrinitarian-war%E2%80%9D-reflections-contemporary-armed-conflicts DH)

In addition the technological superiority has… but "virtual"[xvii] for who suffer from it.[xviii]

**Contention 4 is the Political:**

**Contention 1 proves that we are in danger, DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER! In the moment of existential threat, the political must be supreme and separate from all other considerations.**
**Odysseos 02** – (2002, Louiza Odysseos, PhD International Relations, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at the <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/|University of Sussex]]</span>, “Dangerous ontologies: the ethos of survival and ethical theorizing in International Relations,” Review of International Studies (2002), 28, 403–418, Google Scholar DH)

By allowing the political to coalesce around… acceptance of the dangerous ontology is discussed in greater detail below.

**The affirmation of the sovereign decision is the foundation of human life – voting aff is the condition of possibility for all other political actions.**
**Behnke and Bishai, 04** – (3/17/04, Andreas Behnke, PhD, Lecturer in Political Theory, School of Politics and IR, University of Reading, Adjunct Professor in the Department of Political Science at Towson University, and Linda Bishai, PhD, International Relations, senior program officer in the Education and Training Center/International at the United States Institute of Peace, where she focuses on international relations, conflict resolution, human rights and peace studies, “War, Violence and the Displacement of the Political" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p73563_index.html DH)

Conflict is possible as a structure of difference, and such… deny the same to the enemy (Schmitt 1996a: 54).


===2AC=== 

**The use of PSC’s challenges the norm of the state role in war – they are combatants who do not obey the laws of war and who do not fit into the nomos of the international order.**
**Krahmann, 09** – (Elke, Senior Lecturer in International Relations, Department of Politics, University of Bristol, “Private Security Companies and the State Monopoly on Violence: A Case of Norm Change?” http://www.humansecuritygateway.com/documents/PRIF_Prvt_Security_and_The%20State_Monopoly_on_Violence.pdf DH)

The consequences of the changing conception of… local laws on private security contractors.

**A Clausewitzian understanding of military strategy is a prerequisite to understanding war.**
**Herberg-Rothe 06** – (12/13/06, Andreas, PhD, lecturer in Political Science at the Institute for Social Sciences, Humboldt-University Berlin, “Clausewitz or Sun Tzu – Paradigms of warfare for the 21st century,” http://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com/showArticle3.cfm?article_id=13757 DH)

Nietzsche’s philosophy is a radical critique of the classical thinking… variety of approaches to the world, i.e., a variety of interpretations.

**THE WORLD IS CHAOS – EMBRACE IT, THE ALTENRNATIVE DRIVE FOR CERTAINTY AND ORDER ONLY CAUSES GENOCIDE AND FASCISM**

**Clamor for change in the system and the descriptions of suffering therein are distractions. Humanity must awake and change itself internally.**

**Discourse of order and control subverts lived human experience in service of the false idol of security.**
**Der Derian 98** (James, Prof of PoliSci at the U of Massachusetts, "The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard," Cianet, http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/lipschutz12.html, AD: 7/7/09)

We have inherited an ontotheology of security, that is, an a priori… that requires extensive theoretical damage control.

**Utilitarianism calculations attempt to minimize suffering in every way possible; this is a slave morality that assumes that all people should be valued equally. Only through accepting the harsh painful nature of life is it possible to give value to activities.**
**Anomaly** Post-doctoral fellow and lecturer in the political philosophy, policy, and law program @UVA **2k5** (Jonny, “Nietzsche’s Critique of Utilitarianism” Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Issue 29 Muse)

Nietzsche’s preliminary account of the difference between master morality… heaven always leads through the voluptuousness of one’s own hell” (GS 338).

**Contention 2 is enter the flamingo:**

**Fiat is a means by which we can disengage ourselves from what is going on in the world. We speak in hypothetical worlds instead of confronting the powers that bind us now.**
**Deleuze 83** [Gilles, “Nietzsche and Philosophy”, ‘The Dicethrow’, Pg 117-119]

“Passivity”. In ressentiment happiness “appears essentially… The slave needs, to set the other up as evil from the outset.

**New methods of social control have infiltrated the debate sphere—while explicitly open and liberating, implicitly, the status quo mode of debate praxis is being compromised as it is colonized by the restrictive logic of idols.**
**Mitchell 98** - (Gordon, debate coach and professor), “pedagogical possibilities for argumentative agency in academic debate,” argumentation and advocacy, 1998, pg. 44-45.)

The undercultivation of student agency in the academic field of argumentation… deployment of argumentative talent to manufacture public loyalty.

**The way that we talk about teaching matters—how we debate shapes the way we understand society.**
**Giroux ‘10** - (“Rethinking Education as the Practice of Freedom: Paulo Freire and the Promise of Critical Pedagogy” Jan 3, 2010 http://www.truthout.org/10309_Giroux_Freire)

According to Freire, all forms of pedagogy represent a particular… then take responsibility for intervening in the world they inhabit.

**Resolved comes before the colon and refers to our personal decisionmaking precess.**
**AHD 06.** American Heritage Dictionary

resolved v. To cause (a person) to reach a decision.

**And resolved is to decide upon**
**Websters 96** – (Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, 1996 [this evidence was genderparaphrased] [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=resolved])

Resolved means “to determine or decide in purpose; to make ready in mind; to fix; to settle; As, he [or she] was resolved by an unexpected event,”

**Should refers to method of advocacy**
**New Oxford American Dictionary**

Should: Used to indicate obligation, duty, or correctness, typically when criticizing someone's actions

**The modern age is characterized by a disavowal of tragedy. The triumph of Socratic reason manifests in our attempts to resolve the chaotic aspects of life and avoid suffering. This requires the construction of an ideal real world toward which our apparent world aspires creating life as negative vis-à-vis our internalization of ressentiment.**
**Saurette 96**. [Paul, 1996 “I mistrust all Systematizers and Avoid Them: Nietzsche, Arendt and the Crisis of the Will to Order in International Relations Theory.” Millenium Journal of International Studies. Vol. 25, number 1. pp. 3-6]

The Philosophical Foundation of the Will to Truth/Order… contradictory experiences on its own imperfect knowledge and action.

**Positivism and rationalism are means of self-narcosis: as we are fixated on the microcosms of the world around us, we lose sight of what is really there within us. It is a means by which we can run and hide from the feelings that we do not want to deal with.**
**Nietzsche 1887**. (Friedrich), On the Genealogy of Morals, 1887. Translated by Walter Kaufmann, part of Nietzsche: Basic Writings, the Modern Library Classics, page 582 to 583.

But they tell me it is not lacking, it has not merely waged… means of self-narcosis: do you have experience of that?

**Their framework argument is a reactionary response by the conservative side of our community that attempts to isolate and destroy our advocacy.**
Bill **Shanahan,** debate coach, deleted scene from Debate Team, **2005**, “Shanahan on the Magic of Debate,” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rESjqZsIi5Q

I don’t know if you hear it, but there’s a real respect for the Michigan States… being changed in a given debate round, which is, I think, magical.

**The debate community is destroying itself from within. National circuit praxis shuts out low income, minority and female viewpoints.**
**Hanes ’07** - (RUSSELL T., A VOLUNTEER FOR THE NEW YORK AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA URBAN DEBATE LEAGUES, "POPULARIZING DEBATE AN EQUITY STRATEGY", THE ROSTRUM – VOLUME 81 NUMBER 6)

A better explanation is that the 1970s saw the emergence… perspective is a valuable contribution, and CrossX is worth discussing.

**And the concepts they use to justify framework portray debate from the eyes of the idolaters. We are a criticism of what’s now accepted as fair and predictable.**
Henry **Giroux 2007** (“The University in Chains”)

As Stanley Fish has argued, "balance" is a flawed concept… loose on university campuses to do the work of the devil.

**The desire to know and understand the world is hopelessly violent. It must eliminate all those who do not fit into our limited definitions of what is good, everything that does not fit is deemed evil and must be destroyed in order to maintain the certain world. Dr Manhattan had it right, it is exhilarating to live in a world that is ultimately unknowable.**
**James Der Derian**, “The value of security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard,” The Political Subject of Violence, **1993**, pp. 102-105

The desire for security is manifested as a collective resentment… at the end of Daybreak in a series of rhetorical questions:

**The aff is key to policy relevance—discourse and method inform policymaking, we need to talk about them to understand why people would want to make given policies.**
Anthony **Burke**, senior lecturer in IR at University of New South Whales, **2007**, “Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence and Reason,” jstor

When we consider the problem of policy… different concept of existence, security and action.90

==The Surprise Party== 

===1AC=== 

**Contention 1 involves multiplicity:**

**Thus the plans:**

The United States federal government should implement a phased withdrawal of United States counterinsurgency troops in Afghanistan.

Independent from any decision regarding the location of the headquarters of the Third Marine Expeditionary Force, the Department of Defense should agree to gradually withdraw Marines from Japan other than the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit as well as a comparable number of Marines to maintain pre-positioned equipment and maintain access arrangement for the emergency use of Japanese facilities.

The United States federal government should redeploy marines from Japan other than the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit.

So turn on your radios. In the spirit of KRS-One, Jean Grae , NWA, Lauryn Hill, Ice-T, and Dead Prez, David and I advocate the use of hip hop as a strategy in debate to end the policing of black bodies. We have to abolish the cops right here in this community so that it may serve as a praxis and starting point for us to fight back against the pigs in our hoods and the world.

The United States federal government should discontinue missile defense military presence in Japan.

The United States federal government should phase out its military presence in Turkey.

The United States federal government should substantially phase out its use of private military contractors in Afghanistan.

I get out. I get out of this Euro-centric thought that policies bodies of oppressed populations and relegates them to the margins. I get out of the oppressive chains that wrap and squeeze the humanity out of the person. father free us from the bondages through the signiture of your ballot because the only way things will change is if the ballot demands it, breaking the existing paradigm that suppresses true creativity. the resolution is no effective solution to solve for majority of oppressed people.

The United States federal government should substantially reduce its Central Intelligence Agency presence in Afghanistan.

The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence assigned to the counterinsurgency mission in Afghanistan.

We ask that you embrace the position of the iconoclast and smash the images and idols that we have devoted ourselves so dearly to. in the war against the world the united states seeks to protect it’s way of life above all else so that we can sit with pink flamingos next to our above-ground pools sipping on a bud light. these justifications, these icons that our leaders swear to us to protect form the very basis of the war system.

The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence in South Korea.

The United Stated federal government should withdraw ground troops from the Republic of Korea.

We affirm the Guernica transformed by the face of another population killed to save it…now we are asked to substantially reduce military and or police presence in one of six nations. We use the lesson of Guernica to reconstellate the role of the United States in those six nations in the context of a nightmarish history of violence…Warsaw…Dresden…Mai Lai…Grozny…Fallujah…Iraq…Afghanistan…Japan…South Korea…Kuwait…Turkey…

Thus David and I advocate the following plan: The United States Federal Government should withdraw its military presence from the Okinawa prefecture in Japan

Thus David and I advocate the following plan: The United States Federal Government should withdraw its military presence from the Okinawa prefecture in Japan

Thus David and I advocate the following plan: The United States Federal Government should withdraw its military presence from the Okinawa prefecture in Japan

The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military and/or police presence in one or more of the following: South Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey.

The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military and/or police presence in one or more of the following: Corea, Japan and Ryukyu, Khorassan, Kuwait, Iraq, Anatolia.

**Contention 2 involves becoming the historian:**

**Human understanding is mediated linguistically, through our individual and collective interpretations of the texts that surround us. To think and understand historically is to embrace the verbal and linguistic truth of all interpretations – of all versions of truth. Our affirmation of multiple diverse interpretations of the resolution is the ultimate act of being resolved.**
**Gadamer, writing in 1960** – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)

This brings us to the second aspect of the relationship… the possibility of this kind of mediating interpretation.

**We invite everyone in this room – the judges and the negative – to join us in the discovery of wonder. The act of writing and reading is valuable in that it is the ultimate expression of truth – the 1AC allows us to finally understand what we’ve been debating all year.**
**Gadamer, writing in 1960** – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)

This is also true in those cases when there is… and preserves its truth in the immediacy of understanding.

**Our affirmation of difference and alterity within the resolution turns the mundane, everyday experience of debate into something wondrous. A notion of political agency that incorporates wonder allows us to become more engaged and effective political and ethical actors in the world outside of debate.**
**McManus, 07** – (2007, Susan McManus, Lecturer in Political Theory at Queens College, Theory & Event, 10.3, muse)

Jane Bennett, invoking wonder or enchantment, as a "mood with ethical potential,"… touched, wonderstruck, called beyond or on this side of what we already were.

**Put away your framework file – this 1AC is the ultimate act of affirmation. It is precisely the formlessness of our interpretive method that gives it meaning.**
**Gadamer, writing in 1960** – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)

These studies are concerned with the problem of … the conduct of life, but to try to correct false thinking about what they are.

**Our 1AC does not have stable meaning. It is valuable only insofar as it is an experience that is interpreted by the people in this room.**
**Gadamer, writing in 1960** – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)

This insight into the way interpretation and understanding are… Language is the language of reason itself.

**The belief that the 1AC corresponds with any material reality is a misunderstanding that turns truth into sophistry.**
**Gadamer, writing in 1960** – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)

But, as always with Plato, there is a reason for Socrates' being… in fact influences all further thinking about language

**There is no right and wrong. Their objections to our 1AC are merely alternative interpretations that do not disprove the value of our interpretation.**
**Gadamer, writing in 1960** – (Hans-Georg Gadamer, originator of the philosophy of hermeneutics, reciepient of honorary doctorates from: University of Wrocław, University of Leipzig, Philipps-University Marburg, “Truth and Method,” pdf)

Of course it can also happen that we do not address… reference to the appearance of the original, only more or less correct.

**This round is a surprise party just for you, the flamingo is your piñata, and the roll of the ballot is to enjoy it.**
**Keen 69** - (Sam, PhD, Professor of Philosophy, "An Apology for Wonder")

[I can't find the book and I read this directly out of a print copy. If I find it, I will post parameters for this.]

**Affirm can be understood as to confirm an understanding of something**
**Websters 11** – (Miriam-Webster Dictionary, 2011, “affirm,” http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/affirm)

Definition of AFFIRM
transitive verb
1 a : validate, confirm
b : to state positively <he affirmed his innocence>
2 : to assert (as a judgment or decree) as valid or confirmed
3 : to express dedication to <affirm life>

**Language is independent from meaning – their definitions assume a relationship which does not exist.**
**Krippendorf 93** – (1993, Klaus, professor of the Annenberg School for Communication University of Pennsylvania, “Major Metaphors of Communication and some Constructivist Reflections on their Use,” Cybernetics & Human Knowing, 2,1: 3-25, 1993 http://www.asc.upenn.edu/usr/krippendorff/METAPHOR.htm)

The expression "her thoughts were locked in cryptic verse"… relational aspects of communication are rarely addressed.

**By constructing the 1AC as mutually exclusive with more rational, immediately useful forms of knowledge, the neg endorses the epistemic EVISCERATION of wonder.**
**McManus, 07** – (2007, Susan McManus, Lecturer in Political Theory at Queens College, Theory & Event, 10.3, muse)

The encounter with alterity, with that which is other, or as yet unknown,… (hierarchical) relationship between affect and episteme.

**The experience of wonder that is the 1AC is a moment of cognitive dissonance that transcends the particular ordering of the status quo. We must allow ourselves to be carried by the tide of interpretation and become fully open to change.**
**McManus, 07** – (2007, Susan McManus, Lecturer in Political Theory at Queens College, Theory & Event, 10.3, muse)

Throughout this essay, I am concerned to encourage and cultivate hopeful agency… the same, deploys wonder as its vital affective component.

**The cartesian distinction between rational knowledge of the mind and wondrous knowledge of the body is a precondition for racism and violent exclusion of otherness.**
**Pfeifer 09** – (Mar. 2009, Theresa H. Pfeifer, PhD student in sociology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, master’s degree in communication studies, “Deconstructing Cartesian Dualisms of Western Racialized Systems,” Journal of Black Studies, Volume 39, Number 4, March 2009, 528-547, Sage Pub)

As such, corporeal ontology reflects the second sense of the term as it relates… this article – seriously limiting the way we live our lives.

**A rejection of institutionalized racism must take place if we hope to save the planet as well as ourselves.**
**Barndt 91** – (1991, Joseph Barndt, ordained minister, Director of Crossroads, a non profit Organization, “Dismantling Racism: The Continuing Challenge to White America; p.155-156)

To study racism is to study walls. We have looked at barriers and fences… world and ourselves, we dare not allow it to continue.

**Only by experiencing the wondrous beauty around us can we translate our education into anything meaningful.**
**Kahler 07** – (4/11/07, Russ, Editor of Infactispax, peer-reviewed online journal of peace education and social justice dedicated to the examination of issues central to the formation of a peaceful society, doctoral student in the Judith Herb College of Education’s Department of Foundations of Education, “Have you Seen Beauty Today?” http://www.infactispax.org/)

My own life is so busy that I rarely take the time to look… and then the rest of the task may not seem as daunting.


====AT: Roleplaying Good==== 

**Their denial of wonder and the utopian experience destroys our sense of critical agency.**
**McManus, 07** – (2007, Susan McManus, Lecturer in Political Theory at Queens College, Theory & Event, 10.3, muse)
A key symptom of blocked consciousness is the moment ofexhaustion… fissures and glimpses of potentiality to be elicited and activated.23

Writing in the context of diversity, Gallos (1997) referred… maintaining a level of comfort and order that enables students to explore and learn.


====AT: Word Pics==== 

**Reappropriation makes sense uniquely in this context.**
**Butler 04** – (Judith, badass, “Undoing Gender,” Routledge)

In the same way that the terms of an exclusionary modernity… fully anticipated, a politics of hope and anxiety.

**No solvency – a focus on renaming replaces a focus on institutional change—masks the need for pragmatic solutions, leading to inaction**
**Schram 95** – (Sanford F. Schram, professor of social theory and policy at Bryn Mawr College, 1995, words of welfare: The Poverty of Social Science and the Social Science of Poverty)

The sounds of silence are several in poverty research… renaming fail in their efforts to make a politics out of sanitizing language.

**McManus, 07** – (2007, Susan McManus, Lecturer in Political Theory at Queens College, Theory & Event, 10.3, muse)

I have been concerned here to delineate practices of wonder… a world that itself, sometimes, transgresses its "rules."

**The space of wonder and dreaming created by the 1AC offers a unique space for potential resistance and anti-capitalist judgement – this technique is empirically proven by the success of the Zapatista Movement.**
**McManus, 07** – (2007, Susan McManus, Lecturer in Political Theory at Queens College, Theory & Event, 10.3, muse)

Dreaming in the "exteriority" is precisely liminal with respect to western... Here, then, yesterday and tomorrow are given voice in dreaming.

**Cultivating a sense of ethical utopianism and wonder is a prerequisite to effect resistance – only the aff makes the alt possible.**
**Marsh 95** - (James, Professor of Philosophy at Fordham University, “Critique, Action, Liberation” p. 334-335)

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 11pt;">An example from the sphere of personal morality should make the difference clear… The prevailing rationality is profoundly irrational.</span>

**CBCRRA 92** - (1992 H.R. 4421 ; 102 H.R. 4421, text of the Comprehensive Base Closure Reform and Recovery Act of 1992, introduced by Olympia Snowe, lexis)

=====<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">Instability</span>===== 


**We need to maintain a stable military presence in Iraq in order to create a stable democracy, ensure stability, and prevent the emergence of violent civil war and Iranian expansionism. The Iraqi army and security forces cannot solve and will ask US forces to stay in the country past 2011.**

**CP Text**: The United States federal government should delegate to local tribal councils, such as Jirga and Shura, the authority to draft and enact budgets, to use traditional alternatives to centralized justice systems for some offenses, to elect or approve important officials who are now appointed by Kabul, and to collect local revenue and enforce local regulation. The central government in Kabul should maintain authority over both foreign policy and internal security matters; however, execution of rural security matters should be placed under local control. The United States federal government should maintain current troop levels in Afghanistan until the transition is complete and a stable government is established. The United States federal government should fully fund its GED Plus Enlistment Program.

**Decentralization would preserve local autonomy and grant the government legitimacy. It would also remove the motive for insurgency solve all their stability advantages. Finally, it makes government counter-terror activities more successful.**

Power sharing would be easier under a decentralized democracy... reasonable chance of balancing interests and adjudicating disputes in Afghanistan, too.

**Success in Afghanistan means creating a decentralized government that would be acceptable to security interests. This requires a clear statement of the objective and concerted effort to produce that objective. Saying Afghanistan is ungovernable is a flawed assumption and is based solely on the pursuit of a centralized, Western style government.**

We now have the end objective in sight.. science and art together, as provided by the concept of frameworks.


====2NC==== 

=====2NC Overview===== 

**This debate round is practice for war-planning and the role of the ballot should be to arbitrate between methodologies for creating military doctrine. The counterplan creates a framework for changing doctrine that is responsive to changing battlefield conditions, historical experience and the development of new technological innovations.**
**Watts and Hale ‘84** Lieutenant Colonel Barry D. Watts (USAFA; M.A., University of Pittsburgh) is Red Team Chief for Project Checkmate at Headquarters USAF.

The second thing that doctrine is not is something that can be safely… attention to the uncompromising realities of battle.

The behavior we call war is wholly a creation of humans… Arnold exemplifies those who created the new framework of the Air Force.

**Method for doctrine development is key—evaluate the MEANS of forming doctrine prior to its implementation**

Doctrine should not be considered as strictly precise rules… frustrated in convincing the leadership that "there" was worth getting to.

Doctrine and technological development should be interrelated… closer to coherence among ideas, technology, and practice.


**The counterplan is textually and functionally competitive and is substantively distinct from the formal political action of the plan EVEN THOUGH IT IMMEDIATELY RESULTS IN THE PLAN. Our Kono evidence provides a slew of reasons why in the instance of military planning, the METHODS OF FORMING doctrines are a key. This method question evaluatively precedes implementation**

**Best, 06** – (2006, Steven, PhD, associate professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso, co-founder of the Institute for Critical Animal Studies (ICAS), “Rethinking Revolution: Animal Liberation, Human Liberation, and the Future of the Left,” The International Journal of INCLUSIVE DEMOCRACY, Vol. 2, No. 3 (June 2006), http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol2/vol2_no3_Best_rethinking_revolution_PRINT

The next great step in moral evolution is to… non-speciesist principles and universal justice.


====AT: Perm==== 

**Complicity in the institutional and bureaucratic structures of human modernity locks you in the banality of evil. You are like the Nazi collaborators who, while they didn’t directly murder Jews, were nonetheless complicity in atrocity.**
**Kochi and Ordan 08** – (Dec. 2008, Tarik Kochi, PhD, Lecturer in Law & International Security, University of Sussex, Noam Ordan, linguist and translator, conducts research in Translation Studies at Bar Ilan University, research focus on human cultural history, “An argument for the global suicide of humanity,” Borderlands, http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol7no3_2008/kochiordan_argument.pdf DH)

In one sense, the human individual's modern complicity… either valid and worthwhile, or false and a sham.


====AT: Humans Good==== 

**Humanity doesn’t have any inherent value above other life – we need to overcome the one sided and privileged notion of “human value”**
**Kochi and Ordan 08** – (Dec. 2008, Tarik Kochi, PhD, Lecturer in Law & International Security, University of Sussex, Noam Ordan, linguist and translator, conducts research in Translation Studies at Bar Ilan University, research focus on human cultural history, “An argument for the global suicide of humanity,” Borderlands, http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol7no3_2008/kochiordan_argument.pdf DH)

The theory that smoke from burning cities and forests… interrelated, poorly understood meteorological phenomena.


====AT: Growth Good==== 

**Growth is unsustainable and we have already passed its limits – collapse is inevitable; better now than later.**
**Simms and Johnson, 10** – (Andrew Simms, policy director and head of climate change and energy at the New Economics Foundation, and a participating member of Oxfam and the International Institute for Environment and Development as well as a regular contributor to the International Red Cross’s annual World Disasters Report, and Victoria Johnson, PhD in Atmospheric Physics, Imperial College of London, climate change and energy program researcher at the New Economics Foundation, January 2010, “Growth isn’t possible: Why we need a new economic direction,” New Economics Foundation, http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/growth-isnt-possible DH)

===False Choice K (COIN)=== 

====1NC==== 

**Current debates about Afghanistan are mired in the false choice between COIN and Counterterror – the reality is that our operations in Afghanistan fit neither mold and the simplification put forward by the 1AC ensures spectacular failure no matter their conclusion.**

Eight years of frustration, violence and… ultimately determine success or failure in the region.

**Specifically, classifying Al Qaeda and the Taliban as either insurgents or terrorists simplifies the nature of our enemy and results in flawed military method and praxis.**

Additionally, Washington must step beyond the ‘COIN versus counterterrorism’… the sooner our new enemies will be defeated.

**And their apporach ensures failure – we need a more flexible, contextual approach to doctrine formation.**
**Exum 09** – (2009, Andrew, Fellow with the Center for a New American Security, active duty in the U.S. Army from 2000 until 2004, led a platoon of light infantry in Afghanistan in 2002 and a platoon of Army Rangers in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003 and 2004, advisor on the CENTCOM Assessment Team, “On CT vs. COIN,” Small Wars Journal, http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/journal/docs-temp/200-exum.pdf DH)

The distinction between COIN and CT, however… to offer policy-makers solutions beyond the usual models.

**And the impact is EVERYTHING – recalibrating our strategic military thinking for the 21st century is key to prevent multiple scenarios for extinction.**
**Kennedy 10** – (Mar. 2010, Robert, PhD, Political Science, Professor in the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, Dr. Kennedy has served as a foreign affairs officer with the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Dwight D.

It might be facile to contend that the need for systematic thinking… if the United States is to deal successfully with future problems.

**Our alternative is to reject the binary, COIN versus CT framing of the 1AC in favor of a context and actor based theory of war and doctrine formation. A reevaluation of the way we approach threats must precede decisions regarding policy – their flawed approach ensures that more innovative and effective solutions are glossed over and that military policy in Afghanistan continues to fail.**
**Gorka and Kilcullen 11** – (Sebastian L.v. Gorka, teaches on the faculty of the college of International security Affairs at the National Defense U. and Military Affairs Fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracy, and David Kilcullen, Counterinsurgency Advisor to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, International security Assistance Force, the U.S. Government, and other governments, “An Actor-centric Theory of War: Understanding the Difference Between COIN and Counterinsurgency,” Issue 60.1, http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA535254&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf)

The depth of the strategic conversation in the United States has… unconventional foe, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, stated: “War is war.” 17 JFQ

**And our reevaluation of military strategy in Afghanistan comes first – solves policy failure.**
**Schrecker 10** – (Oct. 2010, Lieutenant Colonel Mark Schrecker, USMC, Joint Forces Quarterly, “U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan: Flawed Assumptions Will Lead to Ultimate Failure,” http://www.ndu.edu/press/US-strategy-in-afghanistan.html DH)

Before assessing the Obama administration's strategy… strategy built on flawed assumptions is doomed to failure.

**Finally, our academic evaluation of strategy is the only possible path to policy success.**
**Gorka 10** – (5/17/10, Sebastian L.v. Gorka, teaches on the faculty of the college of International security Affairs at the National Defense U. and Military Affairs Fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracy, “Al-Qaeda and Afghanistan in Strategic Context: Counterinsurgency versus Counterterrorism,” Elcano Institute, http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_eng/Content?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/international+terrorism/dt15-2010 DH)

What America needs today is that small group of wise men… clear understanding of the enemy and its recent trajectory.


====Alt Solvency==== 

**And an actor centric contextual approach is best.**
**Gorka and Kilcullen 11** – (Sebastian L.v. Gorka, teaches on the faculty of the college of International security Affairs at the National Defense U. and Military Affairs Fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracy, and David Kilcullen, Counterinsurgency Advisor to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, International security Assistance Force, the U.S. Government, and other governments, “An Actor-centric Theory of War: Understanding the Difference Between COIN and Counterinsurgency,” Issue 60.1, http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA535254&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf)

It is common to contend that strategy must follow policy… useful- ness of the military options that might be chosen.

**Failure to broaden the process of strategy formation locks us in linear thinking and causes policy failure.**
**Kennedy 10** – (Mar. 2010, Robert, PhD, Political Science, Professor in the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, Dr. Kennedy has served as a foreign affairs officer with the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Dwight D.

The options development phase of strategy is the phase… of activity if an effective strategy is to be devised. 41

**Their method is suspect – juxtaposing COIN and CT is an oversimplification that results in flawed policies.**
**Schrecker 10** – (Oct. 2010, Lieutenant Colonel Mark Schrecker, USMC, Joint Forces Quarterly, “U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan: Flawed Assumptions Will Lead to Ultimate Failure,” http://www.ndu.edu/press/US-strategy-in-afghanistan.html DH)

This change in methodology regarding the… in a region that widely opposes Western intervention.

**Method comes first specifically in the context of military doctrine:**
**Temple, 92** – (Lt Col L. Parker Temple III, (USAF, Retired (USAFA; MBA, University of Northern Colorado; MS, West Coast University), is a private consultant on space policy and programs. “Of Machine Guns, Yellow Brick Roads, and Doctrine” Airpower Journal, Summer http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj92/sum92/temple.htm)

Doctrine should not be considered as strictly precise… the leadership that "there" was worth getting to.



===Schmitt=== 

====1NC==== 

====="The Political"===== 

**Liberalism denies the distinction of enmity and thus delimits the political – a state of total war and annihilation is only preventable through a agonistic respect for the enemy.**
**Behnke and Bishai, 04** – (3/17/04, Andreas Behnke, PhD, Lecturer in Political Theory, School of Politics and IR, University of Reading, Adjunct Professor in the Department of Political Science at Towson University, and Linda Bishai, PhD, International Relations, senior program officer in the Education and Training Center/International at the United States Institute of Peace, where she focuses on international relations, conflict resolution, human rights and peace studies, “War, Violence and the Displacement of the Political" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p73563_index.html)

From a Schmittean perspective, nothing of this should come as a surprise... who must determine their own destiny (Byers and Chesterman 2000: 291).

**Our alternative is to draw clear lines in the sand as an expression of the fundamental equality of our enmity. The violence of the political will not just go away while modern liberals imagine a world without war – it is this dream that reproduces the worst forms of violence and absolute exclusion. Solvency is an irrelevant question - our duty is not to eliminate war, but rather to question the processes and discourses which unleash its true horror.**
**Rasch 05** – (Spring 2005, William Rasch, Professor and Chair of Germanic Studies. Ph.D. University of Washington/Seattle, “Lines in the Sand: Enmity as a Structuring Principle,” South Atlantic Quarterly 104(2): 253-262 (2005), Duke University Press)

But how are we to respond? For those who say there is no war... asphyxiating political nightmares of absolute exclusion.


====Links==== 

**We are impact turning your aff – you attempt to eliminate the friend/enemy distinction by eliminating representations of existential threat – this destroys the authentic experience of the political.**
**Huysmans, 98** – (1998, Jef Huysmans, PhD, Lecturer in International Relations and European Studies at the London Centre of International Relations, University of Kent, England, Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Studies and director of the Centre for Citizenship, Identities, Governance at the Faculty of Social Sciences, The Open University, “The Question of the Limit: Desecuritisation and the Aesthetics of Horror in Political Realism,” Millennium - Journal of International Studies 1998 27: 569, Sage)

As already stated, the kernel of securitsation is the manufacturing of an existential threat to a community... challenges the fundaments of the political realist constitution of the political community head on.

David and Grondin p. 182-3 2006)

Relations between states are, at least in part, constructed upon representations... action one will adopt in order to deal with this 'other'.

Focusing solely on policy relevance is a poor model for scholarship and reproduces flawed policies – their pedagogy in this round is flawed and destroys any potential for education.

By allowing the political to coalesce around the extreme case... the dangerous ontology is discussed in greater detail below.


=====AT: Schmitt = Nazi===== 

**Classifying Schmitt’s theories in the context of Nazism is a simplification and misunderstanding – his personal views are separate from his academic theories.**
**Zarmanian, 06** – (Thalin Zarmanian, PhD, International Relations, Professor at the University of Milan, “Carl Schmitt and the Problem of Legal Order: From Domestic to International,” Leiden Journal of International Law, 19 (2006), pp. 41–67, Proquest)

The mere fact of Schmitt’s being one of the most controversial figures... juridical and political tradition, and deserves a better understanding.

=====AT: Schmitt = Violent===== 


**Schmitt is not an apologist for violence, but rather attempts to limit the destructive nature of war and prevent the total annihilation of all humanity.**
**Behnke and Bishai, 04** – (3/17/04, Andreas Behnke, PhD, Lecturer in Political Theory, School of Politics and IR, University of Reading, Adjunct Professor in the Department of Political Science at Towson University, and Linda Bishai, PhD, International Relations, senior program officer in the Education and Training Center/International at the United States Institute of Peace, where she focuses on international relations, conflict resolution, human rights and peace studies, “War, Violence and the Displacement of the Political" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p73563_index.html)

The central argument in Schmitt’s political theory is that all social realms... its externalisation into the outside realm of the Political.


=====AT: We Solve Otherization===== 

**Embracing the other doesn’t solve alterity, it just makes violence impossible to manage and unleashes the uncontained violence of the political.**

At the turn of the 20th century, the “Terrible Turk”... The 21st century opened up with genocide, in Darfur.

**The alternative is to reject the 1AC. Orientalism sustains itself through a constant rush to understand and intervene in the East – only a freeze on this rush to action can allow new forms of scholarship to emerge. A humanist approach stressing individual critique can liberate us from the dominant discourse.**
**Said, ’03** – (Edward, Palestinian-American literary theorist and advocate for Palestinian rights, University Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University and a founding figure in postcolonialism, 8-4-09, “Orientalism: 25 Years Later,” http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/ptaber/An%20143/Said%20Orientalism%2025%20yearslater.htm)

My idea in Orientalism is to use humanistic critique to open up the fields of struggle... and libertarian impulses that bind us together in this tiny planet.

**Their espistemology matters - the affirmative’s Orientalist claims are not based on reality but rather a racist form of discourse that shapes the nature of the world it seeks to describe and makes colonial power relations permanent.**
**Anand 07** - (Dibyesh, Reader, IR, U Westminster. PhD, politics, Bristol, “Western Colonial Representations of the Other,” http://staff.bath.ac.uk/ecsda/DAnandNPSArticleMar07.pdf)

Within the context of European imperialism, the issue of the representation of natives... lead to the debasement and negation of most non-Western natives and idealization of some.

Otherness, in Wolfowitz’s rendition, is also discursively constituted... excluding contradictions and tensions that are as much a part of Self as it is of the Other.

======Patriarchy====== 

**The affirmative reifies the role of America as the patriarchal dominator and the Orient as the oppressed victim – this is an extension of orientalist thinking and makes the subjugation of women and continued racism inevitable.**
**Kim 98** – (1998, Hyun Sook Kim, Professor of Sociology at Wheaton University, “Yanggongju as an Allegory of the Nation: The representation of working class women in popular and radical texts,” written in Dangerous Gender and Korean Nationalism)

Kim Yon-ja's testimony was relegated to the margins of this forum... women as heterogeneous, material subjects making their own histories.

**Lockman 05** - (Zachary, Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, NYU. PhD, Harvard, Critique from the Right, CR: The New Centennial Review 5.1 (2005) 63-110, MUSE)

But there is a larger issue at stake here... seem to realize that he was doing a fair bit of theorizing himself.

=====AT: Alt Doesn't Solve===== 

**Intellecutal criticism can provide the starting point for a new form of scholarship to emerge, simply by thinking outside the dominant discourse of orientalism – key to catalyze larger social movements.**
**Bilgin 05** – (2005, Pinar, Assistant Prof of International Relations at Bilkent University, “REGIONAL SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE”, PAGE 67-69)

Emphasising the mutually interactive relationship between intellectuals and social movements... the potential impact their research could make on the subject of research (Wyn Jones 1999:148-50).

=====AT: Perm===== 

**Western colonialism marginalizes alternative voices – Orientalist engagement with the East is shallow and unproductive because it always seeks to interpret rather than simply to listen. Only critique from the margins has a chance at progressive change.**

Yet to receive much critical attention in development theory and practice... researchers want to know about her experiences, but not her own explanations:

**The permutation is impossible – allowing emancipatory practices to be pre-empted by the immediacies of traditional problem solving IR marginalizes the k and prevents solvency.**
**Bilgin 05** – (2005, Pinar Bilgin, Assistant Prof of International Relations at Bilkent University, “REGIONAL SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE”, pp. 207-8)

The implication of these conclusions for practice is that becoming aware... conception of a 'desired' future but is also cognisant of 'threats to the future'.

Said had indeed deployed weapons of intellectual mass destruction... knowledge is power but it certainly hopes that ignorance is.

**Critiques of Said lump all anti-Orientalists together in a petty attempt to discredit a theory seen as dangerous to the dominant Orientalist institutions.**
**Owen 09** – A.J.

**Memmi 2k** - (Albert, Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ U of Paris, Naiteire, Racism, Translated by Steve Martinot, p. 163-165)

The struggle against racism will be long, difficult, without intermission... True, it is a wager, but the stakes are irresistible.

**Their ethnocentric way of understanding the world replicates endless violence and makes practical solutions in IR impossible.**
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Barger 08** - (Ken, Professor of Anthropology, Indiana University, Ethnocentrism, http://www.iupui.edu/~anthkb/ethnocen.htm) </span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">To address the deeper issues involved in ethnocentrism… time usually proves to be self-destructive for all concerned. </span>

===Predictions Kritik=== 

====1NC - Kurasawa==== 

**Predictions are key to cultivate critical thinking and a democratically engaged society – checks back exaggeration and abuse of predictions.**
**Kurasawa 0**4 – Associate Professor of Sociology at York University – (2004, Fuyuki Kurasawa, “Cautionary Tales: The Global Culture of Prevention and the Work of Foresight,” Constellations, Vol. 11, No. 4)

Lastly, I contended that the work of preventive foresight can parry alarmist misappropriation... sowing the seeds of such a practice of participatory democracy.

**Dystopian moral imagination is key to cultivate an engaged citizenry and create a democratic society.**
**Kurasawa 04** – Associate Professor of Sociology at York University – (2004, Fuyuki Kurasawa, “Cautionary Tales: The Global Culture of Prevention and the Work of Foresight,” Constellations, Vol. 11, No. 4)

NGOs and social movements active in global civil society... but can be – and indeed ought to be – changed.

**The alternative is to reject the 1AC. A bottom up advocacy practice for predictive foresight can ground a new form of public pedagogy centered around civil responsibility and critical thinking.**
**Kurasawa 04** – Associate Professor of Sociology at York University – (2004, Fuyuki Kurasawa, “Cautionary Tales: The Global Culture of Prevention and the Work of Foresight,” Constellations, Vol. 11, No. 4)

None of this is to disavow the international community’s rather patchy record... starting with us, in the here and now.

**Totalitarianism contributes to a culture and cycle of insidious violence. This will culminate in extinction.**
**Lifton 89** – (Robert Jay Liftion, MD and phd in psychology, updated preface to Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism, pg. vii-v.)

Now, after twenty-eight years, my own sense of this book has changed... ideological totalism in this book is meant to further that species orientation.

====1NC - Beck==== 

**A global risk society offers the tools for social emancipation and a global democratic public discourse. Reaction to risk is the basis of hope for the future.**
**Beck, 06** – (Aug. 2006, Ulrich Beck, professor of sociology at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilian University, Centennial Professor, London School of Economics and Political Science, British Journal of Sociology, “Living in the world risk society,” Economy and Society Volume 35 Number 3 August 2006: 329-45, Google Scholar)

1) Involuntary enlightenment Hurricane Katrina was a horrifying act of nature… battle grounds for the somewhat hazy power space of global domestic politics.

**Far from causing Otherization, a global culture of risk has the potential for enlightenment that transcends borders and brings humanity together in a new cosmopolitanism.**
**Beck, 06** – (Aug. 2006, Ulrich Beck, professor of sociology at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilian University, Centennial Professor, London School of Economics and Political Science, British Journal of Sociology, “Living in the world risk society,” Economy and Society Volume 35 Number 3 August 2006: 329-45, Google Scholar)

That is what ‘enforced cosmopolitanization’ means: global risks activate… global risks, to open it up conceptually and to research it.

**The alternative is to reject the 1AC as a way to decode the logic of globalization in the context of transnational capitalism. Their attempt to ignore risk is an attempt to disempower the foundations of sovereignty and global civil society, thus consolidating the power of neoliberalism. A new politics of golden handcuffs in which all states are bound by risk into structures of interdependence challenges the stranglehold of capital on geopolitics.**
**Beck, 06** – (Aug. 2006, Ulrich Beck, professor of sociology at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilian University, Centennial Professor, London School of Economics and Political Science, British Journal of Sociology, “Living in the world risk society,” Economy and Society Volume 35 Number 3 August 2006: 329-45, Google Scholar)

6) Possibility of alternative government - Important as all these arguments are… national interests and the greater our individual power in this global age will be.


====2NC==== 

=====AT: Framework===== 

**The way that we talk about teaching matters—how we debate shapes the way we understand society. We must critically interrogate the assumptions made within this round in order to create a debate space that allows us to actually take responsibility for changing the world we occupy.**
**Giroux 10** – (1/3/10, Henry Giroux, “Rethinking Education as the Practice of Freedom: Paulo Freire and the Promise of Critical Pedagogy” http://www.truthout.org/10309_Giroux_Freire)

According to Freire, all forms of pedagogy represent a particular way of understanding society... structure every aspect of society and to then take responsibility for intervening in the world they inhabit.

=====AT: Alt Doesn't Solve===== 

**Debate education accesses the strongest internal link into increasing critical thinking – this round matters.**
**Allen et al 04** – (Mike Allen, Mary Trejo, Michael Bartanen, Anthony Schroeder, Tammie Ulrich. Diversity in United States forensics: a report on research conducted for the American Forensic Association Published in Argumentation and Advocacy http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6699/is_3_40/ai_n29101621/)

Scholarly advocates for competitive forensics have held a belief in forensics... participation rates reflect the changing dynamic of the population.

=====AT: Predictions Bad===== 

**Predictions avoid a state of permanent emergency. They allow us to reclaim our agency from passivity.**
**Bindé 2k** - (Jérôme, Dir. Analysis and Forecasting Office – UNESCO, Public Culture, “Toward an Ethics of the Future”, 12:1, Project Muse)

An ethics of the future is not an ethics in the future... paraphrase a common saying, the future delayed is the future denied.

**Even if predictions are not always accurate, refusing to predict anything is foolish when faced with possible crises.**
**Kurasawa 04** – Associate Professor of Sociology at York University – (2004, Fuyuki Kurasawa, “Cautionary Tales: The Global Culture of Prevention and the Work of Foresight,” Constellations, Vol. 11, No. 4)

When engaging in the labor of preventive foresight... anticipate and prepare for possible and avoidable sources of harm to our successors.

=====Impact - Critical Thinking===== 

**Critical thinking key to solving all the problems that face humanity – it’s the only way to give ourselves value to life.**
**Elder 09** (Linda, educational psychologist and president of the Foundation for Critical Thinking and Executive Director of the Center for Critical Thinking, “Are you a critical thinker?” Christian Science Monitor OPINION; Pg. 9 March 12, 2009 Lexis)

How can we hope to thoughtfully address the economic issues, conflicts, world poverty... our social institutions, in government, and indeed, in every part of human life.

===Mann K=== 

====1NC==== 

**Critique from the margins in not revolutionary – they are a site of orientation towards rather than opposition to the center. By defining themselves in opposition to capitalism, the aff becomes integrated into the system they attempt to destroy.**
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Mann 96** – (Paul Mann Jan. 1996, "The Nine Grounds of Intellectual Warfare", Post Modern Culture, Volume 6, No. 2, Project Muse)</span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">The intellectual position is therefore not simply a ground… Effective resistance must be located in other tactical forms.</span>


**And intellectual warfare is nothing revolutionary. Their performance is highly ritualized and has no disruptive potential.**
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Mann 96** – (Paul Mann Jan. 1996, "The Nine Grounds of Intellectual Warfare", Post Modern Culture, Volume 6, No. 2, Project Muse)</span>

**Our alternative is nomadism in the face of the “revolutionary” position adopted by the 1NC. We refuse to define our criticism in relation to status quo oppression. Critique without position can accomplish anything once it is freed from the shackles of the 1AC.**
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Mann 96** – (Paul Mann Jan. 1996, "The Nine Grounds of Intellectual Warfare", Post Modern Culture, Volume 6, No. 2, Project Muse)</span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Mann 96** – (Paul Mann Jan. 1996, "The Nine Grounds of Intellectual Warfare", Post Modern Culture, Volume 6, No. 2, Project Muse)</span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">We are about to witness a rise of "war studies" in the humanities… I will have more to say about this contradiction.</span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Mann 99** – (Paul Man, 1999, "Masocriticism", The SUNY series in postmodern culture, 19-21)</span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">1. It would be excellent if the farce called criticism could be brought to an end… gestures of self-effacement that is entirely characteristic of criticism.</span>

**Critique of commodification sustains the dominant discursive economy – their criticism is the opposite of revolutionary.**
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Mann 96** – (Paul Mann Jan. 1996, "The Nine Grounds of Intellectual Warfare", Post Modern Culture, Volume 6, No. 2, Project Muse)</span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Mann 96** – (Paul Mann Jan. 1996, "The Nine Grounds of Intellectual Warfare", Post Modern Culture, Volume 6, No. 2, Project Muse)</span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">Consider what Clausewitz calls the fog of war… autodestruction of reason in the process that one finds in Clausewitz.</span>

**Our alternative is silence in the face of their self-serving performance. Critique is nothing but a show that not only fails to solve anything but replicates warfare and oppression in new, more insidious forms. For critique to be successful, it must be secret and invisible.**
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Mann 99** – (Paul Man, 1999, "Masocriticism", The SUNY series in postmodern culture, xi-xii)</span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">That, in brief, is where the argument of Theory-Death leaves off… a theatricalism that is, after all, one of masocriticism’s most distinctive traits. </span>

===Emotions K=== 

====1NC==== 

<span style="margin: 0px;">**The notion that troop reductions can solve conflict and fear by reassuring our allies and enemies assumes that fear is the only dominant emotion in conflict and post-conflict situations and marginalizes a more comprehensive analysis of emotions in IR.**</span>

===Taoism K=== 

====1NC==== 

**Living according to the Tao, or the way of the universe, precludes taking action to prevent death and suffering, even the extinction of all life on earth. As participants in the course of the universe, we are blind to its overarching meaning and thus any action we take will be misguided, unproductive, and immoral.**
**Kirkland,** Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Cultures, specialist in Asian Religions, Associate Professor of Religion at UGA, **98** - (1996, Russell Kirkland, "’RESPONSIBLE NON-ACTION’ IN A NATURAL WORLD : PERSPECTIVES FROM THE NEI-YEH, CHUANG-TZU, AND TAO-TE CHING" HARVARD CONFERENCE ON TAOISM AND ECOLOGY)

In the Taoist classic Huai-nan-tzu, one finds a famous story… emotional reaction to events does not mislead us into a foolish course of action.
**This applies equally to both individual suffering and the extinction of all life on earth – their calls to save humanity are based on a flawed fear of death and a misunderstanding of the continuous nature of the universe.**
**Kirkland 98** - (1996, Russell Kirkland, Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Cultures, specialist in Asian Religions, Associate Professor of Religion at UGA, "’RESPONSIBLE NON-ACTION’ IN A NATURAL WORLD : PERSPECTIVES FROM THE NEI-YEH, CHUANG-TZU, AND TAO-TE CHING" HARVARD CONFERENCE ON TAOISM AND ECOLOGY)

But by this definition, the natural order, which we are enjoined to respect… fuss to the immaterial state from which he or she originally emerged.
**The alternative is to embrace the practice of Wu Wei, or “doing nothing” in order to appreciate the flow of the Tao – only through appreciating the natural order of life can we live according to Taoism.**
**Kirkland 96** – (1996, Russell Kirkland, Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Cultures, specialist in Asian Religions, Associate Professor of Religion at UGA, "The Book of the Way," 24-29)

The focus of the Daode jing is something called "the Tao (or Dao),"… is the most powerful force in existence, and nothing can thwart its unceasing operation.

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**The K solves the case. We don’t reject solving problems, we reject the flawed interventionism that problem solving consists of today.

===Norm=== 

====1NC==== 

**There is no reason to vote affirmative—their complicity with normative legal thought renders their project useless and ineffective.**
**Schlag 90**. Pierre Schlag, professor of law at the University of Colorado, Stanford Law Review, lexis

In fact, normative legal thought is so much in a hurry that it will… persons who are virtually never in a position to put any of its wonderful normative advice into effect.

**They may make arguments about the value of their speech act, but that is ultimately bullshit—language is not a neutral conduit for expression, but much of it is ineffective.**
**Schlag 90**. Pierre Schlag, professor of law at the University of Colorado, Stanford Law Review, lexis

One answer is precisely that normative legal thought conceives… active intervention on the part of the participants in constructing communication.

**The question of “what should be done,” while enticing, is the wrong question—their description of the status quo as a fixed, describable place is a lie. Talking in terms of “should” is pointless and guarantees fascism.**
**Schlag 91**. Pierre Schlag, professor of law at the University of Colorado, 139 U. PA. L. REV.801, april

For these legal thinkers, it will seem especially urgent to ask once again… disputes and discussion that almost all of us in the legal academy practice.


====2NC==== 

**Try or die neg—their rhetorical performance of what the USFG should do shields us from our complicity with ongoing violence and displaces our agency to act out against it.**
**Delgaro 91**. Richard Delgado, professor of law at the University of Colorado, 139 PA. L. Rev. 993, april

But what is the cash value of all this priest-talk in the law reviews… found in cases where the Supreme Court has been faced with subsistence claims.

**Roleplaying as the USFG trains us to be servants to bureaucracy and makes us defenseless against the logic of institutions, isolating us as unable to effect the very institutions we cannot stop talking about. Refusing to engage the question of “why” and jumping to “how” guarantees fascism.**
**Schlag 91**. Pierre Schlag, professor of law at the University of Colorado, 1991, 139 U PA L. Rev. 801, april

The problem for us, as legal thinkers, is that the normative appeal of normative… thought is already largely the bureaucratic logic of institutions.

===Cosmopolitanism K=== 

====1NC==== 

**The aff’s Pax Americana is the antithesis of true multilateral engagement. We attempt to Americanize the world in our image and securitize against the dangerous other in order to lock out all risk. The result in an authoritarian society governed through racism.**

Fifth lesson: I think it is necessary to distinguish clearly… apprehension of terrorism and bristling with the poison of racism.

**And the logic of nation based realpolitik is becoming obsolete in our increasingly globalized world. The aff locks us within the temporal and geographic coordinates of nationalism rather than embracing the advent of true cosmopolitanism.**

The Cultural Consequences of Globalization, p. 26-7 DH)

To summarize, the dualism that lies at the base of cosmopolitanism… study a dialectic of conflict between cosmopolitanization and its enemies.

**Totalitarianism contributes to a culture and cycle of insidious violence. This will culminate in extinction.**
**Lifton 89** – (Robert Jay Liftion, MD and phd in psychology, updated preface to Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism, pg. vii-v.)

Now, after twenty-eight years, my own sense of this book has changed. I see it as less a specific record of… evaluation of ideological totalism in this book is meant to further that species orientation.

**The alternative is to reject the 1AC as a way to decode the logic of nationalism in the context of the globalization of risk. The equality of vulnerability to the new generation of threats offers us a unique opportunity to transcend national boundaries and interests and enter a new era of cosmopolitan realpolitik. Instead of using the nation state to lock down security, we should embrace global risk as a tool for emancipatory politics.**
**Beck, 06** – (Aug. 2006, Ulrich Beck, professor of sociology at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilian University, Centennial Professor, London School of Economics and Political Science, British Journal of Sociology, “Living in the world risk society,” Economy and Society Volume 35 Number 3: 329-45, Google Scholar DH)

6) Possibility of alternative government - Important as all these arguments are, the decisive… interests and the greater our individual power in this global age will be.

**The methodological starting point of the affirmative is flawed. If we are to comprehend global problems emerging in the 21st century, we must transition social scientific research from a nationalist perspective to one of cosmopolitan imaginatio. Our deconstruction of the aff can serve as the starting point for a new form of empirical research and action.**
**Beck and Sznaider 06** – (Mar 2006, Ulrich Beck and Natan Sznaider, Professor of sociology at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilian University and the London School of Economics; and professor of sociology at the Academic College of Tel-Aviv-Yaffo, Israel. “Unpacking cosmopolitanism for the social sciences: a research agenda,” The British Journal of Sociology 57.1, Wiley InterSciences)

Parker Temple III, (USAF, Retired (USAFA; MBA, University of Northern Colorado; MS, West Coast University), is a private consultant on space policy and programs. “Of Machine Guns, Yellow Brick Roads, and Doctrine” Airpower Journal, Summer http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj92/sum92/temple.htm)

Doctrine should not be considered as strictly precise rules… in convincing the leadership that "there" was worth getting to.

**Focusing solely on policy relevance is a poor model for scholarship and reproduces flawed policies.**
**Jones 09** – (Lee, PhD, lecturer in International Relations at Queen Mary, University of London, Journal of Critical Globalization Studies Issue 1 2009)

Having conceded where Nye has a point, let’s now consider the ways in which he may simply be… of State for Security Assistance, Science, and Technology. (p. 127-30)



=====AT: Perm===== 

**A new form of critical cosmopolitanism can only surface once we have broken free from the pax americana and the logic of hegemonic interests.**
**Spence 05** – (June 2005, Keith, PhD, Professor of Criminology, Global Security and Policing at the University of Leicester, “World Risk Society and War Against Terror,” Political Studies, 2005, Vol. 53, 284-302 DH)

For Beck (2002b, pp. 51–3), cosmopolitanism presents itself as a methodological… cosmopolitan in the fullest post-national and post-hegemonic sense.

=====AT: Realism===== 

**National realism is obsolete – no one nation can translate power into dominance.**
**Armistead 04** – (Edwin Armistead, International Relations instructor at JFSC, “Information Operations: The Hard Reality of Soft Power”a collaborative publication by the Joint Command, Control, and Information Warfare School (JCIWS) instructors at the Joint Forces Staff College (JFSC), as well as our guest speakers and former students. The authors are professional Information Operations instructors, who conduct the only joint Information Warfare (IW) course in the United States. In that capacity, they teach over 1000 personnel each year in a variety of IO and IW courses dealing with operations in the information age and how information is changing the way warfare is conducted. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">[[http://www.iwar.org.uk/iwar/resources/jiopc/io-textbook.pdf]]</span>)

In a technical sense, military power is often the easiest variable… However, the threats to the United States have risen as well.

=====AT: Heg Good===== 

**We are not multipolarity – their impact turns all rely on the conception of the nation state – we transcend those categories to have true cosmopolitanism.**
**Grande 06** – (Mar. 2006, Edgar, PhD, professor at the Geschwister-Scholl-Institute for Political Science, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, “Cosmopolitan Political Science,” The British Journal of Sociology
Volume 57, Issue 1, pages 87–111, March 2006, ebsco, DH)

For this reason, it is important to clearly distinguish between… essentially transcends national sovereignty. This can be done in various ways:

**American hegemony is obsolete in a world of globalized, transnational threats like terrorism, crime, and refugees.**
**Beck 05** – (2005, Ulrich, professor of sociology at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilian University, Centennial Professor, London School of Economics and Political Science, “War Is Peace: On Post-National War,” Security Dialogue 2005 36:5, sage DH)

At the same time, the means of control of the world hegemon are… least transitional terrorism have long ago erased these wishful borders.





==Impact Turns== 

===Iran Prolif Good=== 

====1NC==== 

**Nuclear weapons solve insecurity – all nations large and small become more cautious and less antagonistic of the world order when they possess nuclear weapons.**
**Madson, ’06** – (3/06, Peter N. Madson, Lieutenant, United States Navy, Master’s degree in National Security Affairs, “The Sky is Not Falling: Regional Reaction to a Nuclear Armed Iran,” http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA445779.)

Nuclear Optimists advocate a gradual increase in the number of nuclear states… “miscalculation difficult and politically pertinent predictions easy.”17

**Specifically, bilateral deterrence between Iran and Israel would stabilize the Middle East and prevent conflict.**
**Kaye and Wehrey, 07** - (2007, Dalia Dassa Kaye, Political Scientist at the RAND Corporation, Frederic M. Wehrey, International Policy Analyst at the RAND Corporation, “A Nuclear Iran: The Reactions of Neighbours,” Survival, 49: 2, 111-128)

Public opinion in the Arab world is largely sympathetic to an Iranian… counter the anticipated spike in Iranian black-market activity.61

**Middle East instability escalates**
**Primakov, 9** [September, Yevgeny, President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation; Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences; member of the Editorial Board of Russia in Global Affairs. This article is based on the scientific report for which the author was awarded the Lomonosov Gold Medal of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2008, “The Middle East Problem
in the Context of International Relations”]

The Middle East conflict is unparalleled in terms of its potential… President Obama’s position does not completely rule out such a possibility.

====2NC==== 

=====Hezbollah Impact===== 

**A nuclear Iran would be more likely to cut ties with Hezbollah.**
**Sadr, 05** – (2005, Ehsaneh Sadr, graduate student at the department of government and politics at the University of Maryland, Middle East Policy, the most cited, peer reviewed academic journal in the field, “The Impact of Iran’s Nuclearization on Israel,” MEP, 12.2 (Summer 2005): p58(15))

There may, in fact, be reason to believe that a nuclearized Iran… Hezbollah support might be perceived as unnecessary.

**Iranian funding key to Hezbollah’s operations.**
**Gienger 4/20** – (4/20/10, Viola Gienger, Bloomberg News, “Iran Gives Weapons to Re-Arm Hezbollah, Pentagon Says,” http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-20/iran-gives-weapons-funds-to-help-lebanese-hezbollah-re-arm.html)

Iran has provided weapons and as much as $200 million a year… said in a telephone interview he had no comment on the report.

**Hezbollah presents the primary terrorist threat to the US.**
**Webster and AFP, 9** – (6/26/09, Stephan Webster and AFP, “Terrorism expert: Hezbollah more dangerous than al Qaeda,” http://www.lebanonwire.com/0906MLN/09062605RS.asp)

A counterterrorism official with the New York… 30,000 fighters, and extraordinary political influence.”

**Terrorism causes extinction.**
**Alexander, 2003** - [Yonah, professor and director of the Inter-University for Terrorism Studies, Washington Times, 8/28]
Last week's brutal suicide bombings in Baghdad and Jerusalem… For without victory, there is no survival. "

=====Oil Prices Impact===== 

**Iran nuclearization solves oil prices – opens dialogue with US.**
**Madson, ’06** – (3/06, Peter N. Madson, Lieutenant, United States Navy, Master’s degree in National Security Affairs, “The Sky is Not Falling: Regional Reaction to a Nuclear Armed Iran,” http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA445779.)

No matter the course decided, it will impact the United States’… lower prices, but the increased access to oil markets.

**Oil price spike collapses the global economy**
**Pollack 3** – (Kenneth M. Pollack, Director of Research at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. From 1995 to 1996 and 1999 to 2001, he served as Director for Persian Gulf
Affairs on the staff of the National Security Council, 2003, “ Securing the Gulf “)

America's primary interest in the Persian Gulf lies… destroying the American economy along with everybody else's.

**Econ collapse causes power vacuum multiple nuclear wars, terrorism, and extinction**
**Friedberg and Schoenfeld, 8** - (Aaron L. Friedberg (professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, served from 2003 to 2005 in the office of the Vice President of the United States as deputy assistant for national-security affairs and director of policy planning. PhD in Politics from Harvard) and Gabriel Schoenfeld (senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington DC and a resident scholar at the Witherspoon Institute in Princeton) October 21, 2008 “The Dangers of a Diminished America” http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122455074012352571.html?mod=rss_opinion_main)

Then there are the dolorous consequences of a potential collapse… divert attention from internal travails with external adventures.

=====AT: Iran Strikes===== 

**A nuclear Iran doesn’t pose an existential risk to Israel and might actually be the first step towards normalizing relations – infinity warrants**
**Sadr, 05** – (2005, Ehsaneh Sadr, graduate student at the department of government and politics at the University of Maryland, Middle East Policy, the most cited, peer reviewed academic journal in the field, “The Impact of Iran’s Nuclearization on Israel,” MEP, 12.2 (Summer 2005): p58(15))

The above analysis indicates that a nuclearized Iran is extremely unlikely… world has witnessed since Hiroshima and Nagasaki--that is, zero.

=====AT: Israel Strikes===== 

**Iran will not attack Israel fearing future repercussions and Israel will not first strike – failure of Osirak proves.**
**Madson, ’06** – (3/06, Peter N. Madson, Lieutenant, United States Navy, Master’s degree in National Security Affairs, “The Sky is Not Falling: Regional Reaction to a Nuclear Armed Iran,” http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA445779.)

There are three prime reasons against military action… full-fledged nuclear weapons program immediately afterwards.

=====AT: Iran = Ideological===== 

**Iran’s ideological front is a mask for a true policy of realpolitik.**
**Madson, ’06** – (3/06, Peter N. Madson, Lieutenant, United States Navy, Master’s degree in National Security Affairs, “The Sky is Not Falling: Regional Reaction to a Nuclear Armed Iran,” http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA445779.)

Apparently, Ahmadinejad in his fiery rhetoric does not speak… and help completing the Bushehr nuclear power plant.

=====AT: No MAD===== 

**The argument that Iranian leaders don’t understand MAD are flawed, ethnocentric, racist, and have no factual basing.**
**Sadr, 05** – (2005, Ehsaneh Sadr, graduate student at the department of government and politics at the University of Maryland, Middle East Policy, the most cited, peer reviewed academic journal in the field, “The Impact of Iran’s Nuclearization on Israel,” MEP, 12.2 (Summer 2005): p58(15))

The first reason is that Iran's leaders are unlikely to understand… from the scholar's vanity than the policy maker's need.

=====AT: Nuclear Terrorism===== 

**Iran would not give nukes to terrorists – not completely loyal to Iran.**
**Sadr, 05** – (2005, Ehsaneh Sadr, graduate student at the department of government and politics at the University of Maryland, Middle East Policy, the most cited, peer reviewed academic journal in the field, “The Impact of Iran’s Nuclearization on Israel,” MEP, 12.2 (Summer 2005): p58(15))

Iran's support for terrorist groups targeting Israel… an independent organization whose allegiance is not guaranteed.

=====AT: Middle East Prolif===== 

**No escalation to Middle East prolif – Gulf states have no desire for nukes and starting nuclear programs would take too long. Also, no state could get enough to balance Iran.**
**Madson, ’06** – (3/06, Peter N. Madson, Lieutenant, United States Navy, Master’s degree in National Security Affairs, “The Sky is Not Falling: Regional Reaction to a Nuclear Armed Iran,” http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA445779.)

None of the Arab Gulf States have a nuclear-weapons program… states’ nuclear capability, raising serious questions from the IAEA.

**And it goes on and on and on.**
**Friedman 09** – (1/27/09, George Friedman, Founder and CEO of STRATFOR, the World’s Leading Private Intelligence and Forecasting Company, Media Expert, “The Next 100 Years,” p. 49)

Standing at the beginning of the twenty-first century… at least, that will be the United States.

**Imperial overstretch is ridiculous – percent GDP military spending has been decreasing and domestic social stability solves the impacts.**

Nye Jr., aka Jesus, PhD, University Distinguished Service Professor at Harvard University, “The Future of American Power: Dominance and Decline in Perspective,” http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66796/joseph-s-nye-jr/the-future-of-american-power DH)

Some argue that the United States suffers from… civil rights, were arguably more serious than any of today's.

**Power outweighs.**
**Friedman 09** – (1/27/09, George Friedman, Founder and CEO of STRATFOR, the World’s Leading Private Intelligence and Forecasting Company, Media Expert, “The Next 100 Years,” p. 49 – DH)

The United States wins as long as al Qaeda loses… just as American power will define the twenty-first century.

**Afghanistan doesn’t affect the budget.**
**Carafano 10** – (1/2/10, James Jay, Senior Research Fellow for National Security at the Heritage Foundation & Director of the Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies, “Con: Obama must win fast in Afghanistan or risk new wars across the globe,”http://gazettextra.com/news/2010/jan/02/con-obama-must-win-fast-afghanistan-or-risk-new-wa/)

None of this is to suggest that staying in Afghanistan… failure in Afghanistan would be incalculably high.

**No impact for readiness.**
**Amos 10** – (9/21/10, General James Amos, Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, “Advance Policy Question for General James F. Amos,” http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/2010/09%20September/

Gen Amos: No, combat operations in Afghanistan… I do not foresee adverse impacts on retention.

====2NC – Hegemony==== 

**Squo solves – Iraq withdrawal, increased dwell time, and equipment reconstitution.**
**Kreisher 10/27** – (Otto, quoting General George W. Casey, Army Chief of Staff, Association of the United States Army, “Chief sees Army ‘breathing a bit easier.’” http://www.ausa.org/meetings/2010/annualmeeting/am/

After nine years of conflict and three years of… specialties to skills needed in the new security environment, Casey said.

It is currently fashionable to compare the United States' power… can lead to dangerous mistakes in policy.

**Debt can’t collapse heg.**
**Nye, qualified badass, 10** – (Dec. 2010, Joseph S. Nye Jr., aka Jesus, PhD, University Distinguished Service Professor at Harvard University, “The Future of American Power: Dominance and Decline in Perspective,” http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66796/joseph-s-nye-jr/the-future-of-american-power DH)

Other concerns about the future of the U.S. economy… cost of servicing the debt could affect the long-term health of the economy.

**Afghanistan is below the radar.**
**Keeter 09** – (8/16/09, Scott, “Topic A -- How Many Troops Are Needed in Afghanistan?” http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/14/AR2009081402949.html)

The public opinion climate for sending more troops is difficult… 2 percent of national news coverage was devoted to the war.

====1NC – Winning the War==== 

**All we do is win, win, win.**
**Kagan and Kagan, 1/7** – (2011, Frederick W. Kagan, PhD, former professor at West Point, director of the Critical Threats Project at AEI Kimberly Kagan, PhD, President of Institute for the Study of War, former professor at West Point, Yale University, Georgetown University, and American University, “Defining Success in Afghanistan,” http://www.aei.org/paper/100184 DH)
One year after President Barack Obama’s decision to… re-attack areas that we believe we have secured.

**We’re pwning the war – every factor is going our way and their predictions are too early to be reliable.**
**Kagan and Kagan, 1/7** – (2011, Frederick W. Kagan, PhD, former professor at West Point, director of the Critical Threats Project at AEI Kimberly Kagan, PhD, President of Institute for the Study of War, former professor at West Point, Yale University, Georgetown University, and American University, “Defining Success in Afghanistan,” http://www.aei.org/paper/100184 DH)

The New Year finds the situation in southern… depth of progress before then extremely difficult

**2014 makes victory a sure thing – solves corruption, government legitimacy, gets Pakistan on our side, marginalizes the Taliban, and gives us the time to crush the insurgency.**
**Bergen 10** – (12/16/10, Peter, frequent visitor to Afghanistan since 1993, is the director of the National Security Studies Program at the New America Foundation, “The Generals’ Victory,” http://www.tnr.com/book/review/
the-generals-victory-obamas-wars-woodward?page=0,2 DH)

So what does this all mean? History suggests that an insurgent group… as good a definition of victory as we can hope for.

====2NC – Winning the War==== 

**So much win – increased quality of life, decreased violence, military victories, better governance, improved army training, and a stable Helmand all prove.**
**Dressler 11** – (Jan. 2011, Jeffrey, research analyst at the institute for the study of War (isW), where he studies security dynamics in southeastern and southern afghanistan, Dressler's work has drawn praise from members of the marine Corps and the intelligence community for its understanding of the enemy network in southern afghanistan and analysis of the military campaign in helmand province over the past several years, “
Counterinsurgency in Helmand,” http://www.understandingwar.org/files/Afghanistan_Report_8_web.pdf DH)

Over the course of the past year, the momentum in helmand… past eighteen months in helmand is undeniable.

**We have reversed the insurgency – only our evidnece assumes the most recent situation in Kandahar and the ALP’s success.**
**Kagan and Kagan, 1/7** – (2011, Frederick W. Kagan, PhD, former professor at West Point, director of the Critical Threats Project at AEI Kimberly Kagan, PhD, President of Institute for the Study of War, former professor at West Point, Yale University, Georgetown University, and American University, “Defining Success in Afghanistan,” http://www.aei.org/paper/100184 DH)

ISAF and ANSF forces continue to hold all of the… it is probably fair to say, actually reversed.

**The new ALP program kills the Taliban and extends the reach of limited COIN forces.**
**Kagan and Kagan, 1/7** – (2011, Frederick W. Kagan, PhD, former professor at West Point, director of the Critical Threats Project at AEI Kimberly Kagan, PhD, President of Institute for the Study of War, former professor at West Point, Yale University, Georgetown University, and American University, “Defining Success in Afghanistan,” http://www.aei.org/paper/100184 DH)

The emergence of a functional and credible local security… fight against them with limited, but dedicated, American help.

====1NC – Pakistan==== 

**US forces don’t cause flight to Pakistan – its just misinformation by the Pakistani government.**
**Bruno 10** – (4/9/10, Greg, defense and national security analyst for CFR, “ Miscalculations in U.S. Afghan Offensive,” http://www.cfr.org/publication/21863/miscalculations_in_us_afghan_offensive.html)

The Pakistani government's argument that somehow… They've become a Frankenstein that Pakistan can't control.

**The Pakistani military is badass and would never let anything happen to their nukes – the idea of a complete Taliban takeover is preposterous.**
**Pillar 11** – (1/3/11, Paul, Professor of Security studies at Georgetown University, 28-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency, member of the Center for Peace and Security Studies, “Politicking in Pakistan” http://nationalinterest.org/blog/paul-pillar/politicking-pakistan-4661)

There's no doubt that Pakistan represents a heap… northwest will ever get their hands on the nukes.

====2NC – Pakistan==== 

**The current strategy is capable of solving pakistan.**
**Kagan and Kagan, 1/7** – (2011, Frederick W. Kagan, PhD, former professor at West Point, director of the Critical Threats Project at AEI Kimberly Kagan, PhD, President of Institute for the Study of War, former professor at West Point, Yale University, Georgetown University, and American University, “Defining Success in Afghanistan,” http://www.aei.org/paper/100184 DH)

The persistence of insurgent sanctuaries in Pakistan… Afghanistan to move, to sleep, to hide, and to operate.

**Won’t collapse – even the floods didn’t destabilize the government and military.**
**Zaidi 10** – (9/29/10, S. Akbar Zaidi, visiting scholar in the Carnegie Endowment’s South Asia Program. A visiting professor at Columbia University, with a joint appointment in the School of International Public Affairs and MESAAS, the Department of the Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies, “Pakistan After the Floods,” Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/

The government is increasingly unpopular, as its reaction… The flood has not curtailed the military’s internal reach.

**Global Changes 09** – (10/13/09, “The Decline of the Dollar,” Globalchanges.org, http://www.global-changes.com/the-decline-of-the-dollar/)

One year on, and the Credit Crunch could prove… save the west from economic gloom.

====2NC – Dollar Heg==== 

**The notion that we can fix the economy by cutting spending is flawed – structural problems like health care, our trade relationship with China, and the Bush tax cuts have to be addressed first.**
**Haas, 2/3** – (2011, Lawrence, former senior White House official and award-winning journalist, is Senior Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy at the American Foreign Policy Council, “Sorry, the Federal Deficit Isn’t a Spending Problem,” http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2011/02/03/Sorry-the-Federal-Deficit-Isnt-a-Spending-Problem.aspx DH)

Forgive me for interrupting this bipartisan love-fest… rising again later on due to soaring health care costs.

====1NC – Warming==== 

**America sucks and won’t actually try to solve warming – all just moral masturbation.**
**Spencer 08** – (Roy W. Spencer, Ph.D. in meteorology, Principal Research Scientist at the University of Alabama, former Senior Scientist for Climate Studies at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center recipeint of NASA’s Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal for their global temperature monitoring work, U.S. Science Team leader for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer flying on NASA’s Aqua satellite, he has provided congressional testimony several times on the subject of global warming, he has never been asked by any oil company to perform any kind of service, “Climate Confusion,” p. 152 -3 DH)

Congress has had a nasty habit of passing legislation… warming-reducing gain to show for the resulting economic pain.

**Multiple recent studies confirm the correlation between cosmic rays and warming – massive solvency deficit to emissions reductions.**
**Rao, PhD in space science, January 2011** – (Udipi Ramachandra, PhD, space science, former chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, current Chairman of the Governing Council of the Physical Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad, “Contribution of changing galactic cosmic ray flux to global warming,” CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 100, NO. 2, 25 JANUARY 2011, http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/25jan2011/223.pdf DH)

The well established excellent correlation between… from the data presented by McCracken and Beer 3,4 .

====2NC – Warming==== 

**The capacity of the deep ocean to absorb heat means that at worst the process takes thousands of years.**
**Roe and Bauman 11** – (1/6/11, Gerard H. Roe, Professor, Department of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, and, Yoram Bauman, Professor, Program on the Environment, University of Washington, Seattle, “Should the climate tail wag the policy dog?” http://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/roe/GerardWeb/Publications_files/martydom_draft.pdf DH)

A key player in the physical system is the enormous thermal… its effects have been reviewed in Baker and Roe (2009).

**Prefer evidence from meteorologists – models are flawed and physicists suck.**

Spencer, Ph.D. in meteorology, Principal Research Scientist at the University of Alabama, former Senior Scientist for Climate Studies at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center recipeint of NASA’s Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal for their global temperature monitoring work, U.S. Science Team leader for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer flying on NASA’s Aqua satellite, he has provided congressional testimony several times on the subject of global warming, he has never been asked by any oil company to perform any kind of service, “Climate Confusion,” p. 87 DH)

Over the years, I have noticed a distinct difference in… modelers are often unduly confident in their model predictions.


===Realism Frontline=== 

**Realism is true and inevitable – a shift away collapses into chaos.**
**Mearsheimer 01** - (2001, John, professor of political science at University of Chicago, The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, pg. 361)

The optimists' claim that security competition and war... keeping the major states in each region at peace.

**Realism and the self-help theory are rooted in human nature – anarchic worlds from the dawn of time to today created an impetus for realist thought.**
**Thayer 04** – (2004, Bradley, Fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and has taught at Dartmouth College and the University of Minnesota, "Darwin and International Relations: On the Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict," University of Kentucky Press, pg. 75-76)

The central issue here is what causes states to behave... family's or tribes need for food, shelter, or other resources).

**Humans are inherently realist – early humans were force by their natural environment**
**Spegele 96** - (1996, Robert D Spegele, Political realism in international theory ed. Cambridge University Press p. 161, jstor)

As alternative, Alexander advances the idea that... relationship between competing human units, groups or institutions.

===Reps Frontline=== 

**Focusing purely on representation hinders understanding of policy by overlooking questions of agency and material structures**
**Tuathail, 96** (Gearoid, Department of Georgraphy at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Political Geography, 15(6-7), p. 664, science direct)

While theoretical debates at academic conferences are important... open to the patterned mess that is human history.

**A focus on representations destroys social change by ignoring political and material constraints**
**Taft-Kaufman 95** - (Jill, professor, Department of Speech Communication And Dramatic Arts, at Central Michigan University, Southern Communication Journal, Spring, proquest)

The postmodern passwords of "polyvocality," "Otherness," and "difference,"... political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them.

**There are no prior questions to problem oriented IR - empirical validity is a sufficient justification for action. Emphasis on metaphysical hurdles destroys any chance of effectively describing the world and guiding action**
**Owen 02** – (David Owen, Reader of Political Theory at the Univ. of Southampton, Millennium Vol 31 No 3 2002 p. 655-7)

Commenting on the ‘philosophical turn’ in IR, Wæver remarks... and so a potentially vicious circle arises.

===Util Frontline=== 

**Only within a consequentialist framework can we avoid prioritizing the lives of some over others – equality is a net benefit to our framework**
**Cummiskey 96** - (David, Associate Philosophy Professor at Bates College, Kantian Consequentialism, p. 150-151)

Consequentialism thus provides an indirect justification for our intuitive conviction... one’s own subjective concerns do not have overriding importance.

**Util is key to policy that is in the best interest of humanity – none of their criticism is relevant in the realm of public policy, only in individual morality.**
**Shaw 99** - (1999, William H. Shaw, Philosophy and Chair of the Philosophy at San José State University, “Contemporary Ethics: Taking Account Of Utilitarianism” p 171-2)

Utilitarianism ties right and wrong to the promotion of well-being... have long engaged social and political philosophers and that concern.

**Extinction comes first**
**Kateb 92** – (1992, George Kateb, professor of politics at Princeton University, "The Inner Ocean: Individualism and Democratic Culture.")

What does a theory of rights leave undecided? Many issues... they may kill their attackers in the attempt to end the threat.)


===Value to Life Frontline=== 

**Value to life is an inevitable condition of being – our first priority should be ensuring the continuation of human life on earth.**
**Bernstein 02** - (Richard J., Vera List Prof. Phil. – New School for Social Research, “Radical Evil: A Philosophical Interrogation”, p. 188-192)

This is precisely what Jonas does in The Phenomenon of Life, his rethinking... include the future wholeness of Man among the objects of your will." (IR 11)

**Always an inherent value to life**
**Coontz 01** – (2001, Phyllis Coontz, Associate Professor in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Pittsburgh, Journey of Community Health Nursing, 18(4). “Transcending the Suffering of AIDS.” JSTOR)

In the 1950s, psychiatrist and theorist Viktor Frankl (1963) described... future to strengthen one's present life (Reed, 1991 b).


==Specific Rounds== 

===Harvard Round Robin vs. Beacon DF=== 

(the 1AC was the "surprise party" aff further up on the wiki)

====2AC - AT: Beacon's Kritik==== 

**Hermeneutic deconstruction is comparatively a better method than the neg’s criticism. Understanding the contingent nature of all texts and rejecting claims of universality and objectivity allows alternative forms of knowedge to come to the fore, disrupting the forms of knoledge production the elevate Whiteness, masculinity, and elite institutions above all else.

====Counterplan==== 

=====1NC===== 

**Counterplan Text:** The United States federal government should publically declare that it will not cooperate with Taiwan on missile defense systems and that joint Japanese-US missile defense systems will not be extended to include Taiwan. The US should also implement an immediate ban on the development of space weapons and ASAT systems. The United States federal government will declare that it will not be the first state to use nuclear weapons in a conflict between the United States and China over Taiwan. The United States Federal Government should establish a policy of comprehensive and public congressional oversight of all activities related to the deployment of Japanese BMD. This should include declassifying details of developmental tests and all official threat assessments regarding Japanese TMD, ending evolutionary spiral development and acquisition processes for defense technology and take all necessary steps to encourage open public debate on the issue in both the United States and Japan.

Despite these concerns, many long-time observers assert that the alliance… although obstacles still remain for a seamless integration.27

======China====== 

**BMD systems are key to signal a credible deterrent to China – their threats of escalation are a red herring to distract from their current arms build up. The consequences of BMD deployments are comparatively better than an alternative of unchecked Chinese militarization.**
**Brookes, 2k** – (8/17/2000, Peter, Principal Adviser for East Asian Affairs with the majority staff of the Committee on International Relations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Senior Fellow, National Security Affairs and Chung Ju-Yung Fellow for Policy Studies, Heritage Foundation, “Theater Missile Defense: How Will It Recast Security and Diplomacy in East Asia?,” http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/theater-missile-defense-how-will-it-recast-security-and-diplomacy-in-east-asia DH)

It seems to me that the deployment of a serious boost-phase capability… by the defense will land the debris right back in the attacker’s lap.

====Case Defense==== 

**The aff mixes up causality – Chinese force modernization predates BMD deployments. The reason we have not gone to war yet is our credible deterrent and missile defense systems in the area. Chinese complaints are a red herring to distract from their nuclear buildup.**
**Brookes, 2k** – (8/17/2000, Peter, Principal Adviser for East Asian Affairs with the majority staff of the Committee on International Relations of the U.S. House of Representatives, Senior Fellow, National Security Affairs and Chung Ju-Yung Fellow for Policy Studies, Heritage Foundation, “Theater Missile Defense: How Will It Recast Security and Diplomacy in East Asia?,” http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/theater-missile-defense-how-will-it-recast-security-and-diplomacy-in-east-asia DH)

Not surprisingly, the Chinese have vociferously condemned… Chinese claims to the contrary are a "red herring."

**Cutting BMD will not prevent China from modernizing its nuclear forces and will not solve Chinese concerns over Japanese militarization and US hegemony – missile defense solves deterrence and US-Japan alliance cohesion.**

Rather than reinforcing END to counter the DPRK’s nuclear weapons... will bring the fiery shower of our nuclear retaliation over South Korea in an "emergency.” 21

**And only conventional deterrence can solve the North Korean threat, and solve US credibility in the region – nuclear coercion is detrimental to US interests and causes more threats than it prevents.**

**Any visible cuts in our naval spending encourage Chinese aggression and kills the perception of credible deterrence in East Asia.**
**Christian Science Monitor, 10/25** – (2010, Jim Bencivenga, “Will US naval power sink?,” http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/1025/Will-US-naval-power-sink)

For most Americans, naval power is like gravity… US Seventh Fleet in the Pacific and what a nation must do, over time, to keep threats at bay.

**Regional states’ confidence in the U.S. commitment is key to East Asian stability and U.S. global leadership – the impact is rapid Japan remilitarization, Taiwan conflict and instability in India-Pakistan and Korea.**
**Goh, 08** – Lecturer in International Relations in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the Univ of Oxford (Evelyn, International Relations of the Asia-Pacific, “Hierarchy and the role of the United States in the East Asian security order,” 2008 8(3):353-377, Oxford Journals Database)

The centrality of these mutual processes of assurance and deference… The alternatives that could surface as a result of not doing so would appear to be much worse.

**This causes great power nuclear conflict.**

Then there is China, whose growing wealth, nationalism, ambition and need for energy… Its absence or abject weakness would be an invitation to calamity.

The recent reemergence of piracy as a threat to legitimate (and even dangerously illegitimate)… naval supremacy, potentially producing destabilizing environments.

**And maintaining the current commitment to a 313 ship navy is crucial to sustaining our naval power.**

Rather, the most effective way of securing U.S. national interests… before the size of the Navy falls to a dangerously low level.



**No amount of flexibility or networking can get around the fact that a smaller navy is perceived as less dangerous and has less strategic reach and power. Especially true in the context of China and East Asia.**

The Navy’s future is not immune to this fuzzy strategic view of the world… existing manpower commitments and the upwardly spiraling cost of added personnel.


====1NC - Counterplan==== 

**Counterplan:** The United States federal government should withdraw its forces from Atsugi naval air base and downsize its forces at Yokosuka naval base. The United States federal government should redeploy CVN 73 to the Mayport, Florida naval base. The United States federal government should comply with the Navy’s current plan for a 313 ship navy, but should procure the hulls for all new naval vessels abroad while continuing to produce weapons systems domestically.

**Counterplan solves their overstretch advantage – manufacturing the hulls for new ships abroad would massively reduce costs and make the navy’s 313 ship navy possible within the current budget. Only our evidence assumes this unique solution.**
**White 07** – (2007, Robert J. White, senior engineer in the Ranges, Engineering, and Analysis Department at the Naval Sea Systems Command, He has been a Navy Staff action officer for modeling and simulation for weapon system test and evaluation, and an advanced development lead at the NAVSEA Wash- ington Navy Yard headquarters for combat system ship- board training, currently on detail to the Chief of Naval Operations Strategic Studies Group, “GLOBALIZATION OF NAVY SHIPBUILDING,” www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc (google))

The first step to global production warships is to separate high-tech combat…They are two sides of the same coin. If a “thousand ships” can work, so can a “thousand shipyards.”

**And the carrier itself doesn’t matter – their own authors advocate redeployment to the US and none of their evidence advocates decommissioning. Withdrawal from the bases solves.**
**Meyer ‘9** (Captain Carlton W. Meyer, military writer, editor at G2mil.com, served as an officer and combat engineer in the U.S. Marine Corps, “Outdated U.S. Military Bases in Japan,” 2009, http://www.g2mil.com/Japan-bases.htm)

The U.S. Navy has 11 aircraft carriers: five are homeported at Norfolk, Virginia… surprise attack. Remember Pearl Harbor?

**Overseas production would reduce the costs of shipbuilding to a reasonable level – allows the navy to maintain the full 313 ship force within the current budget.**

The Navy states that 313 ships are necessary to support U.S. national security… affordability measure within the new maritime strategy now being formulated.

**Foreign production of warships could outfit the navy for half the current expenditure – solves the whole aff.**

Global warship production would allow the Navy to combine the advantages… “unknowns” like requirements growth, and still save money.

====Full Withdrawal CP==== 


<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Counterplan:** The United States Federal Government should close the Marines Corp Air Station Futenma in the Okinawa Prefecture of Japan and phase out all Marines stationed on Okinawa to the point of elimination. </span>

**Full withdrawal from Okinawa solves the outdated security guarantee, prevents huge federal budget deficits, and sustains the war on terror.**
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Carpenter, 03** – (2003, Ted Galen Carpenter, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. He is the author of eight and the editor of 10 books on international affairs, “The Cato Handbook for Congress: Clearing the Decks for War,” http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/handbook108.html) </span>
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">Nevertheless, the United States has never fully trusted Japan and… it would be better than the current wasteful situation. </span>

**Full withdrawal is the only way to achieve alliance equality and grant justice to Okinawa – Tokyo must take responsibility for its own defense. Strengthens alliance cooperation on all other issues.**
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Bandow 10** – (3/25/10, Doug Bandow, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, “Okinawa and the Problem of Empire,” http://www.huffingtonpost.com/doug-bandow/okinawa-and-the-problems_b_512610.html#) </span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">Thus, the issue of fairness to Okinawa is tied to the more basic question… Then Okinawans finally might gain justice -- after 65 long years. </span>

**The relationship between the US and Japan is a closed, dualistic relationship that silences Okinawan voices so that they are unable to make determinations about their own social and political issues**
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Inoue, 7** -- Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from Duke University and assistant professor of the Japan Studies Program and the Department of Modern and Classical Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at the University of Kentucky. Visiting Associate Professor in the Department of Engineering of the Shibaura Institute of Technology (4/15, Masamichi S., “Okinawa and the U.S. Military: Identity Making in the Age of Globalization) </span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">These two political and conceptual problems in the postmodern/colonial/structural… Self and Other will never be able to fully internalize. </span>

**The status quo is waging war on the Okinawans, treating them as objects to be manipulated by political elites. Only withdrawal can incorporate Okinawan identity into the alliance.**
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">Deborah **Mantle,** Lecturer in the College of International Relations at Ritsumeikan University (Japan), **2006** (“Defending the Dugong: Redefining ‘Security’ in Okinawa and Japan,” Ritsumeikan Annual Review of International Studies, Volume 5, Available Online at http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/cg/ir/college/bulletin/e-vol.5/MANTLE.pdf, p. 85-86) </span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">The diminishing population of Okinawa dugongs graze the sea grasses… activists and academics living within and outside of Okinawa. </span>

**Intimate societies absolve actors of any constraints, sanctioning endless violence against the excluded other**
<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">**Levinas, 98** -- philosopher and Talmudic commentator (Emmanuel, also: Mihael Bradley Smith, Barbara Harshav, “Entre nous: thinking-of-the-other,” http://books.google.com/books?id=u13lXZIO3QcC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=%22intimate+society%22+violence&source=bl&ots=BzPYpJWWpS&sig=ZYD3AiuQILmDoETtiZm5I7pGn_w&hl=en&ei=ouR7TOiQFYKClAfQ2JjsCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22intimate%20society%22%20violence&f=false) </span>

<span style="tab-stops: 276.0pt;">The forgiveable transgression, apart from its magical significance… but because it does not belong to the order of forgiveness. </span>
