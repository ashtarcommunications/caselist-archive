<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">When General David Petraeus testifies today on Capitol Hill, his main job will be to carefully define the timeline for the beginning of America's exit from Afghanistan, a timeline that has stakeholders in Washington and throughout the region confused and concerned.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&quot;As the President has stated, July 2011 is the point at which we will begin a transition phase in which the Afghan government will take more and more responsibility for its own security,&quot;<span class="BoldUnderline">Petraeus wrote</span> in his <span style="color: black;">advanced questions</span> submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee and obtained by <em>The Cable</em>. &quot;As the President has also indicated<span class="BoldUnderline">, July 2011 is not a date when we will be rapidly withdrawing our forces </span>and -switching off the lights and closing the door behind us.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">His job will</span> also <span class="BoldUnderline">be to defend</span> President <span class="BoldUnderline">Obama's decision to set a public date for the beginning of the withdrawal in the first place</span>, by arguing that having a time line in the public discussion helps pressure the Afghans to move faster toward being able to govern and secure their country on their own.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&quot;I believe <span class="BoldUnderline">there was value in sending a message of urgency -- July 2011... But it is important that July 2011 be seen for what it is: the date when a process begins, in which the reduction of US forces must be based on the conditions at the time, and not a date when the U.S. heads for the exits,</span>&quot; he wrote to the committee. He stressed that multiple times that the pace of the drawdown would be &quot;conditions based.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">But even in his own writing to the committee, Petraeus acknowledged that the enemy, the Taliban and other insurgents in Afghanistan, are waiting out the coalition and biding their time until foreign forces decide to leave.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&quot;Insurgent leaders view their tactical and operational losses in 2010 as inevitable and acceptable. The Taliban believe they can outlast the Coalition's will to fight and believe this strategy will be effective despite short-term losses. The Taliban also believe they can sustain momentum and maintain operational capacity,&quot; he wrote.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">One of the main enablers of any U.S. exit is the development of the Afghan National Security Forces, which has not gone at the pace the coalition had hoped. Petraeus wrote that he would review the situation of the ANSF within four months of assuming command, if confirmed.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">As of the latest review, only 5 out of 19 Afghan National Army brigades can function without a majority of their functions supported by the U.S., according to Petraeus, and only 2 out of 7 major headquarters can function properly without significant coalition support. As of June 27, there are 7,261 ANA troops in the city of Kandahar and 6,794 Afghan soldiers in Helmand province, Petraeus wrote.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">He also said that a comprehensive plan to reintegrate some Taliban fighters is under final review with President Hamid Karzai and &quot;offers the potential to reduce violence and provide realistic avenues to assimilate Pashtun insurgents back into Afghanistan society.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Petraeus promised to take a look at the rules of engagement that U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan feel are tying their hands in the fight, but he didn't say whether he was leaning toward changing them or not.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Meanwhile, <span class="BoldUnderline">confusion over the president's timeline persists both in Washington and abroad as interested parties try to interpret the July 2011 date in a way that serves their own political interests.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, said Monday that there would be &quot;<span style="color: black;">a serious drawdown</span>&quot; next summer, seemingly getting ahead of the administration in an effort to appease the liberal wing of her caucus, which is threatening to not support more funding for the war.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Two of the committee members Petraeus will face today, Sens. John McCain<strong>,</strong> R-AZ, and Lindsey Graham, R-SC, held a press conference Thursday to <span style="color: black;">announce their opposition</span> to setting any public date, no matter what the caveats.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Foreign leaders are especially confused, particularly the Afghan and Pakistani governments, who see a difference between public promises of drawdowns and private assurances from the administration </span>that the July 2011 date would not precipitate large scale troop reductions.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">One high level diplomatic source said that Pakistani and Afghan leaders believe that they were told by National Security Advisor Jim Jonesthat there was not going to be a big withdrawal and the there would be &quot;no reduction in commitment&quot; in July 2011.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">But <span class="BoldUnderline">regardless of whether the administration sent mixed messages, the nuance of their time line policy has been misunderstood or ignored in the region, as various actors start to plan strategies with the expectation that U.S. troops are leaving</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&quot;In retrospect, <span class="BoldUnderline">despite all the caveats, it was a mistake to put such a date certain for the beginning of withdrawal</span>,&quot; said Shuja Nawaz, director of the South Asia Center at the Atlantic Council. &quot;<span class="BoldUnderline">The word beginning was lost and it strengthens the ability of different interests to hedge, which is exactly what they've been doing.&quot;</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Over the winter break I had an epiphany about the interrelation of U.S. hard and soft power: </span><span class="BoldUnderline">I</span><span style="color: black;"> now </span><span class="BoldUnderline">oppose a counterinsurgency</span> (COIN)<span class="BoldUnderline">strategy in Afghanistan and advocate a purely counterterror</span><span style="color: black;">(CT) </span><span class="BoldUnderline">strategy </span><span style="color: black;">(PDF link) there instead.</span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Blame history—or histories—that I've read recently, starting with Livy's works on early Rome (books I-V) last spring and Donald Kagan's <em>The Peloponnesian War</em> at the end of 2009. I've taken occasional dips back into Robert Kaplan's <em>Warrior Politics</em> and his source materials (Churchill, the Federalists, Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and several others).</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">What I've taken from that reading is that </span><span class="BoldUnderline">the U.S. must pull back</span><span style="color: black;"> from its current efforts to remake Iraq and Afghanistan in the image of a Western democracy, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">or risk long-term political and economic exhaustion</span><span style="color: black;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">What follows is not an argument about morality, and readers may find much of it amoral. It <em>is</em> about making cold-blooded political andeconomic calculations about where U.S. national interests will lie in the next decade. They do not lie in an open-ended COIN mission.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The history of the Peloponnesian War is particularly relevant here. Athens began fighting Sparta with the resources of an empire and thousands of talents of silver in the bank—enough to fight expensive, far-flung naval and land campaigns for three years without lasting financial consequences.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Athens was <em>rich</em>, and if peace with Sparta had come by the end of the third year, Athens would have continued to prosper and rule over much of the Mediterranean. (Athens had a &quot;hard&quot;—conquered or cowed—empire as opposed to the &quot;soft&quot; empire of alliances and treaties the U.S. currently has.)</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">But the war with Sparta dragged on for decades, despite occasional peace overtures by both sides. By war's end—despite the spoils of battle and increased taxes and tribute extracted from its shrinking dominion—Athens was broke, depopulated by fighting and plague, bereft of its empire, and could no longer project power into the Mediterranean. Where its former interests ranged from Black Sea Turkey to southern Italy, it spent decades as a small-bore power and never regained its former strength or influence.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">I worry that the U.S. is similarly locked into an open-ended commitment to democratize a nation that is of regional rather than global importance—a parallel to Athens convincing itself that it had to conquer distant, militarily insignificant Sicily.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&quot;Winning&quot; in Afghanistan</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The U.S. could &quot;win&quot; in Afghanistan</span><span style="color: black;"> where victory is defined as a stable, legitimate central government that can project power within its own borders. I don't doubt that the U.S. and its allies could accomplish this given enough time and resources. <span class="Underline0">But</span> I think—as many COIN experts also do—that </span><span class="BoldUnderline">it will take at least another decade or more of blood and treasure to produce such a result, if ever</span><span style="color: black;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Of course I'd like to see the results of a successful COIN campaign: a stable democracy, women's rights, and general prosperity for Afghans, who among all Asia's peoples surely deserve those things. I certainly want to end al-Qa'ida's ability to operate freely in South Asia and elsewhere.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The U.S. is the only country that would both conceive of these missions and attempt to carry them out. But goals beyond keeping al-Qa'ida on the run don't serve the long-term interests of the U.S., and I am more interested in regaining and preserving U.S. hard power than I am in the rewards that would come from &quot;winning&quot; a lengthy COIN war.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">I fear the U.S. people and government becoming exhausted from the costs of a lengthy COIN effort, just as they are already exhausted from</span><span style="color: black;">(and have largely forgotten about) the</span><span class="BoldUnderline"> Iraq</span><span style="color: black;"> war. I worry that </span><span class="BoldUnderline">if this fatigue sits in, the U.S. will abandon foreign-policy leadership</span><span style="color: black;"> as it has done periodically throughout history.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">This outcome would be worse than a resurgent Taliban</span><span style="color: black;">, worse than Afghan women and men being further oppressed, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">and worse than al-Qa'ida having plentiful additional caves</span> <span style="color: black;">to plot in.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Here are some signs of an exhaustion of U.S. power: </span><span class="BoldUnderline">The U.S. is already overextended</span><span style="color: black;">, with commitments in Iraq (shrinking for now), Afghanistan (expanding), Yemen (pending) and Iran (TBD). At home, the U.S. economy remains feeble and in the long term is increasingly hostage to other nations for goods and services it no longer produces (and increasingly, no longer <em>can</em> produce).</span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Even more worrisome is the U.S. credit situation. The wars, and much other U.S. government spending, are now heavily underwritten by other countries' purchases of debt the U.S. issues. It has borrowed trillions from foreign countries and especially China, which continues its steady, highly rational policy of promoting exports while freeriding under the American security umbrella (just as the U.S. once rode for free beneath Britain's).</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Over time, those countries accrue enough debt to have a say in U.S. policies that may threaten the dollar's value, which is why you now see high U.S. officials flying to Beijing to soothe PRC nerves and explain why America keeps borrowing money.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">At home, there are few resources to apply following a major disaster, such as a Katrina-style hurricane or a major earthquake.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The U.S. needs to start rebuilding its reserves—of capital, of credit, of political goodwill abroad, of military force—to be ready for these and more serious crises, for which we currently have few resources to spare. Such challenges may involve humanitarian crises (think Darfur, a Rwanda-style genocide, Indian Ocean tsunamis);</span><span style="color: black;"> Latin American instability (Mexico, Venezuela, post-Castro Cuba); </span><span class="BoldUnderline">rogue-state nuclear development (Iran, North Korea); or complex challenges from a rising power (China, a reinvigorated Russia).</span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>Our arguments are especially true with Obama’s recent troops surge – now is a key time for the plan</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">LONDON - <span class="BoldUnderline">Western powers must change strategy in Afghanistan, focusing on al-Qaida militants and cutting troop numbers instead of pursuing failed attempts at nation-building</span>, a top think-tank said Sept. 7.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Urging a major rethink of President Obama's surge policy, the</span> London-based <span class="BoldUnderline">I</span>nternational <span class="BoldUnderline">I</span>nstitute for <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>trategic <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tudies <span class="BoldUnderline">said the international community was &quot;pinned down&quot; as the war entered its 10th year</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">&quot;The co</span>unter-<span class="BoldUnderline">in</span>surgency <span class="BoldUnderline">strategy is too ambitious</span>,&quot; IISS director John Chipman said at the launch of the &quot;Strategic Survey 2010,&quot; the institute's annual report on the global security situation.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Foreign forces should now pursue talks with local Taliban insurgents, target al-Qaida extremists who pose a global threat, and foster a more federal Afghanistan that recognizes the country's ethnic divisions,</span> he said.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&quot;<span class="BoldUnderline">As the military surge reaches its peak and begins to wind down, it may become necessary</span> and is probably advisable <span class="BoldUnderline">for outside powers to move to a containment and deterrence policy to deal with the international terrorist threat from the Afghan-Pakistan border regions,&quot;</span> he said.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Obama has</span> recently appeared to step back from a pledge that U.S. forces would begin withdrawing from Afghanistan in July 2011. He has<span class="BoldUnderline">already deployed 30,000 extra troops as part of Washington's new counter-insurgency strategy</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">But <span class="BoldUnderline">the IISS said it had become &quot;increasingly questionable&quot; whether big goals such as beating back the Taliban, building an Afghan government and security forces and eliminating corruption could be achieved</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">There were widespread concerns that <span class="BoldUnderline">the presence of around 150,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan was itself &quot;what sustains and fuels the Taliban fighters,&quot; he said.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">International forces should return to the original aim of the invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks - to dismantle Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network and deny it a safe haven in Afghanistan</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Al-Qaida's main operations had in any case shifted to Pakistan's troubled tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, Chipman said, calling for the West to engage more with regional powers including Pakistan and India.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">&quot;For Western states to be pinned down militarily and psychologically (in Afghanistan) will not be in the service of their wider political and security interests</span>,&quot; Chipman added.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The need for a new policy is part of a wider picture left by the aftermath of the global financial crisis and by shifts in the balance of power, the 432-page IISS report said.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">It pointed to a group of &quot;newly energized middle powers&quot; including Turkey, Brazil, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates that were trying to extend their clout in their regions.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&quot;<span class="BoldUnderline">With economies and nerves frayed, and the nationalization of foreign policy all the rage, the appetite for very ambitious collective long-term political-military goals is limited in the West</span>,&quot; according to the report.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Turkey and Brazil tried to help resolve Iran's stand-off with Western nations over its nuclear goals, while South Korea and the United Arab Emirates were involved with North Korea and Iran respectively, it said.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Australia, Indonesia and South Korea were promoting regional cooperation and &quot;may in time become a diplomatic force to be reckoned with&quot; against the expansion of Chinese power, it added.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The report said China and India both continued to grow in self-confidence, though the Asian giants still faced &quot;uncomfortable strategic contact&quot; on their border, particularly in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">China's confidence was bolstered by riding out the financial crisis more quickly than other countries, though Beijing faced growing expectations to play a role in addressing world challenges</span>, it said.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">America is losing the war in Afghanistan</span><u><span style="color: black;">.</span></u><span style="color: black;"> Rather than change course, President Obama is sending 21,000 additional U.S. troops. This will bring the total to 68,000 American soldiers fighting in Afghanistan, bolstering coalition forces to 110,000.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">The </span><span class="BoldUnderline">troop surge,</span> however, <span class="BoldUnderline">will not work. Afghanistan has become</span> Mr. <span class="BoldUnderline">Obama's Vietnam - a protracted quagmire</span> <span style="color: black;">draining precious American blood and treasure. August was the deadliest month for U.S. forces, with 47 soldiers killed by Taliban insurgents. More than 300 coalition troops have died in 2009. This is the highest toll since the war began in 2001, and there are still four months to go.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The tide of battle has turned against the West</span><span style="color: black;">. The Taliban is resurgent. It has reasserted control over its southern stronghold in Kandahar.</span><span class="BoldUnderline">The Taliban is launching devastating attacks in the western and northern parts of the country - formerly stable areas. U.S. casualties are soaring. The morale of coalition forces is plummeting</span><u><span style="color: black;">.</span></u><span style="color: black;"> Most of our allies - with the exception of the Canadians and the British - are reluctant to engage the Islamist militants. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">American public support for the war is waning.</span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The conflict has dragged on for nearly eight years. (U.S. involvement in World War II was four years, World War I less than one.) Yet, America's strategic objectives remain incoherent and elusive.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The war's initial aim was to topple the Taliban and eradicate al Qaeda bases from Afghan territory. Those goals have been achieved. Washington should have declared victory and focused on the more important issue: preventing Islamic fundamentalists from seizing power in Pakistan, along with its nuclear arsenal.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Instead, America is engaged in futile nation-building. Mr. Obama, like President George W. Bush before him, believes Afghanistan must be transformed by erecting a strong central government, democracy and a modern economy. Washington argues this will prevent terrorism from taking root and bring about lasting &quot;stability.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hence, following a recent reassessment of the war by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, U.S. commander in Afghanistan, the Obama administration is contemplating deploying 20,000 to 40,000 U.S. troops - on top of the 21,000 already pledged. Moreover, billions have been spent building irrigation canals, schools, hospitals and factories. Civilian advisers are being sent to encourage farmers to grow other cash crops besides opium poppies. Western aid money has been used to establish a massive Afghan army, a large police force and a swollen government bureaucracy.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Gen. McChrystal said this week that the situation is &quot;serious,&quot; but not impossible. He still believes victory is within reach. His new strategy is to protect Afghan civilians from Taliban attacks. He also wants to create a lucrative jobs programs and improve local government services. The goal is to win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of the Afghan people. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says we must combat Afghanistan's &quot;culture of poverty.&quot; Call it humanitarian war through social engineering.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Mr. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Obama's policy will result in a major American defeat - one that will signal the end of America as a superpower and expose us to the world as a paper tiger</span><span style="color: black;">. Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. The mighty British and Russian armies were humiliated in drawn-out guerrilla campaigns</span><span class="BoldUnderline">. The country's mountainous geography</span> <span style="color: black;">and primitive tribal culture </span><span class="BoldUnderline">are ideally suited for insurgent warfare. By sending in more troops, Washington is playing right into the Taliban's hands: We are enabling the Taliban to pick off our forces one by one as they wage a campaign of attrition.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The Taliban blend with the local population, making it almost impossible for U.S. forces to distinguish combatants from civilians. American counterinsurgency efforts are thus alienating some of the locals</span><u><span style="color: black;">. </span></u><span style="color: black;">Initially welcomed as liberators,</span><span class="BoldUnderline"> we are</span> <span style="color: black;">now </span><span class="BoldUnderline">viewed </span><span style="color: black;">in some quarters </span><span class="BoldUnderline">as occupiers</span><span style="color: black;">. Moreover, much of the West's aid money is siphoned off by greedy politicians in Kabul.</span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">President Hamid Karzai's government is corrupt, venal and ineffective. It barely controls one-third of the country. It is despised by many Afghans for its brutality and incompetence. In addition, Mr. Karzai's vice-presidential running mate is a drug trafficker.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The West's efforts to forge a cohesive national state based on federalism and economic reconstruction have failed. Warlords are increasingly asserting power in the provinces. The country is fractured along tribal and ethnic lines. The center cannot hold: Afghanistan remains mired in anarchy, blood feuds and weak, decentralized rule.</span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">U.S. troops should be deployed to defend U.S. national interests. Their lives should never be squandered for an experiment in liberal internationalism. In fact, such a policy is morally grotesque and strategically reckless.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Mr. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Obama should quickly withdraw most U.S. forces from Afghanistan. American air power and small, flexible Special Forces units are more than enough to wipe out al Qaeda terrorists. The Taliban is too hated to reoccupy the country - unless our huge military and economic footprint drives numerous Afghans into the</span><span style="color: black;"> evil, welcoming </span><span class="BoldUnderline">arms of extremists.</span></span><br />

It didn’t make sense to do that then and it doesn’t make sense to do so now. Ronald Reagan won the Cold War against the Evil Soviet Empire in part by employing proxies to fight and win our battles for us.

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as “No. 1” and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying — its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United Statesto diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic.It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance,the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe ’s stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that ’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War II, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world ’s great powers.Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the UnitedStates. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the UnitedStates weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China ’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe — if it adopted what some call a strategy of “offshore balancing” — this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, “offshore” role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel ’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn ’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:83:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@note18&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: note18&quot;/&gt; --><a name="note18"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:83 --> And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn ’t changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">There is an even larger question than whether the U.S. will remain the hegemonic state within a western dominated system</span>. How long will the West remain hegemonic in the global system?25 Since Spengler the issue of the decline of the West has been debated. It would be hard to question current western dominance of virtually every global economic, political, military, or ideological system today. In some ways the domination of the West seems even more firm than it was in the past because the West is no longer a group of fiercely competing states but a much more cohesive force. In the era of western domination, breakdown of the rule of each hegemonic state has come because of competition from powerful rival western states at the core of the system leading to system-wide war. The unique characteristic of the Cold War and particularly the post-Cold War system is that the core capitalist states are now to a large degree politically united and increasingly economically integrated. In the 21st century<span class="BoldUnderline">, two factors taking place outside the West seem more of a threat to the reproduction to the hegemony of the American state and the western system than conflict between western states: 1. resistance to western hegemony in the Muslim world and other parts of the subordinated South and 2. the rise of newly powerful or reformed super states,</span>. Relations between the core and periphery have already undergone one massive transformation in the 20th century—decolonization. The historical significance of decolonization was overshadowed somewhat by the emergence of the Cold War and the nuclear age. Recognition of its impact was dampened somewhat by the subsequent relative lack of change of fundamental economic relations between core and periphery. But <span class="BoldUnderline">one of the historical legacies of decolonization is that ideological legitimation has become more crucial in operating the global system</span>. The manufacture of some level of consent, particularly among the elite in the periphery has to some degree replaced brute domination. Less raw force is necessary but in return a greater burden of ideological and cultural legitimation is required. Now it is no longer enough for colonials to obey, willing participants must believe. Therefore, cultural and ideological challenges to the foundations of the liberal capitalist world view assume much greater significance. Thus the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism, ethnic nationalism, and even social democracy in Latin America as ideologies of opposition have increasing significance in a system dependent on greater levels of willing consent. As Ayoob suggests, <span class="BoldUnderline">the sustained resistance within the Islamic world to western hegemony may have a “demonstration effect” on other southern states with similar grievances against the West</span>.26 The other new dynamic is the re-emergence of great states that at one time or another have been brought low by the western hegemonic system. <span class="BoldUnderline">China</span>, in recent centuries low on the international division of labor, <span class="BoldUnderline">was in some ways a classic case of a peripheral state</span>, or today a semi-peripheral state. But its sheer size, its rapid growth, its currency reserves, its actual and potential markets, etc. <span class="BoldUnderline">make it a major power and a potential future counter hegemon</span>. India lags behind China, but has similar aspirations. Russia has fallen from great power to semi-peripheral status since the collapse of the Soviet empire, but its energy resources and the technological skills of its people make recovery of its former greatness possible. No one knows exactly what the resurgence of Asia portends for the future. However, just as half a century ago global decolonization was a blow to western domination, so the shift in economic production to Asia will redefine global power relations throughout the 21st century. Classical theory of hegemonic cycle is useful if not articulated in too rigid a form. <span class="BoldUnderline">Hegemonic systems do not last forever; they do have a life span. The hegemonic state cannot maintain itself as the fastest growing major economy forever and thus eventually will face relative decline against some major power or powers</span>. The hegemon faces recurrent challenges both on the periphery and from other major powers who feel constrained by the hegemon’s power or are ambitious to usurp its place. Techniques of the application of military force and ideological control may become more sophisticated over time, but so too do techniques of guerilla warfare and ideological forms of resistance such as religious fundamentalism, nationalism, and politicization of ethnic identity. <span class="BoldUnderline">World war may not be imminent, but wars on the periphery have become quite deadly, and the threat of the use of nuclear weapons or other WMD by the rising number of powers who possess them looms</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">The hegemonic state tends to become overstretched, but more importantly the U.S., because of its messianic sense of mission, tends to overreach. Some of the burden the hegemon has to assume is inevitable, but the U.S. is particularly prone to massive miscalculation.</span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The best Afghan policy would be to reduce the number of foreign troops from the current level of 90,000 to far fewer – perhaps 20,000</span><u>.</u> In that case, two distinct objectives would remain for the international community: development and counter-terrorism. Neither would amount to the building of an Afghan state or winning a counter-insurgency campaign. <span class="BoldUnderline">A reduction in troop numbers and a turn away from state-building should not mean total withdrawal: good projects could continue to be undertaken in electricity, water, irrigation, health, education, agriculture, rural development</span> and in other areas favoured by development agencies. <span class="BoldUnderline">Even a light US presence could continue to allow for aggressive operations against Al Qaeda terrorists, in Afghanistan</span>, who plan to attack the United States. The US has successfully prevent Al Qaeda from re-establishing itself since 2001 (though the result has only been to move bin Laden across the border.). The US military could also (with other forms of assistance) support the Afghan military to prevent the Taliban from seizing a city or taking over the country.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">These twin objectives will require a very long-term presence, as indeed is almost inevitable in a country which is as poor, as fragile and traumatized as Afghanistan (and which lacks the internal capacity at the moment to become independent of Foreign aid or control its territory). But a long-term presence will in turn mean a much lighter and more limited presence (if it is to retain US domestic support). We should not control and cannot predict the future of Afghanistan. It may in the future become more violent, or find a decentralised equilibrium or a new national unity, but if its communities continue to want to work with us, we can, over 30 years, encourage the more positive trends in Afghan society and help to contain the more negative.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Such a policy can seem strained, unrealistic, counter-intuitive and unappealing. They appear to betray the hopes of Afghans who trusted us and to allow the Taliban to abuse district towns. No politician wants to be perceived to have underestimated, or failed to address, a terrorist threat; or to write off the ‘blood and treasure’ that we have sunk into Afghanistan; or to admit defeat. Americans are particularly unwilling to believe that problems are insoluble; Obama’s motto is not ‘no we can’t’; soldiers are not trained to admit defeat or to say a mission is impossible. And to suggest that what worked in Iraq won’t work in Afghanistan requires a detailed knowledge of each country’s past, a bold analysis of the causes of development and a rigorous exposition of the differences, for which few have patience.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The greatest risk of our inflated ambitions </span>and fears, encapsulated <span class="BoldUnderline">in the current surge is that it will achieve the exact opposite of its intentions and in fact precipitate a total withdrawal. The heavier our footprint, and the more costly, the less we are likely to be able to sustain it. Public opinion is already turning against it</span><span class="Underline0">.</span> Nato allies are mostly staying in Afghanistan simply to please the United States and have little confidence in our objectives or our reasons. Contemporary political culture tends to encourage black and white solutions: either we garrison or we abandon.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">While, I strongly oppose troop increases, I equally strongly oppose a total flight. <span class="BoldUnderline">We are currently in danger of lurching from troop increases to withdrawal and from engagement to isolation. We are threatening to provide instant electro-shock therapy followed by abandonment. This is the last thing Afghanistan needs</span><u>.</u> The international community should aim to provide a patient, tolerant long-term relationship with a country as poor and traumatized as Afghanistan. Judging by comparable countries in the developing world (and Afghanistan is very near the bottom of the UN Human Development index), making Afghanistan more stable, prosperous and humane is a project which will take decades. It is a worthwhile project in the long-term for us and for Afghans but<span class="BoldUnderline">we will only be able to sustain our presence if we massively reduce our investment</span> and our ambitions and begin to approach Afghanistan more as we do other poor countries in the developing world. <span class="BoldUnderline">The best way of avoiding the mistakes of the </span>1980s and <span class="BoldUnderline">1990s – the familiar cycle of investment and abandonment which most Afghan expect and fear and which have contributed so much to instability and danger - is to</span> husband and conserve our resources, <span class="BoldUnderline">limit our objectives to counter-terrorism</span>and humanitarian assistance and <span class="BoldUnderline">work out how to work with fewer troops</span> and less money over a longer period.

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">But perhaps even more importantly, defining a more moderate and limited strategy gives him leverage over his own generals. By refusing to endorse or use the language of counterinsurgency in the speech, he escapes their doctrinal logic</span><span class="BoldUnderline">. By no longer committing the US to defeating the Taliban or state-building, he dramatically reduces the objectives and the costs of the mission</span><span style="color: black;">. By talking about costs, the fragility of public support, and other priorities, he reminds the generals why this surge must be the last. All of this serves to “cap” the troop increases at current levels and provide the justification for beginning to reduce numbers in 2011.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">But the brilliance of its moderate arguments cannot overcome that statement about withdrawal. With seven words, “our troops will begin to come home,” he loses leverage over the Taliban, as well as leverage he had gained over Karzai and the generals</span><span style="color: black;">. It is a cautious, lawyerly statement, expressed again as “[we will] begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011.” It sets no final exit date or numbers. But the Afghan students who were watching the speech with me ignored these nuances and saw it only as departure.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">This may be fatal for Obama’s ambition to “open the door” to the Taliban. The lighter, more political, and less but still robust militarized presence that his argument implies could facilitate a deal with the Taliban, if it appeared semi-permanent</span><span class="Underline0"><span style="color: black;">.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> As the President asserted, the Taliban are not that strong. They have nothing like the strength or appeal that they had in 1995. They cannot take the capital, let alone recapture the country. There is strong opposition to their presence, particularly in the center and the north of the country. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Their only hope is to negotiate. But the Taliban need to acknowledge this. And the only way they will is if they believe that we are not going to allow the Kabul government to collapse</span><span style="color: black;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Afghanistan has been above all a project not of force but of patience. It would take decades before Afghanistan achieved the political cohesion, stability, wealth, government structures, or even basic education levels of Pakistan. A political settlement requires a reasonably strong permanent government. The best argument against the surge, therefore, was never that a <span class="caps">US</span> operation without an adequate Afghan government partner would be unable to defeat the Taliban—though it won’t. Nor that the attempt to strengthen the <span class="caps">US</span> campaign will intensify resistance, though it may. Nor because such a deployment of over 100,000 troops at a cost of perhaps $100 billion a year would be completely disproportional to the <span class="caps">US</span>’s limited strategic interests and moral obligation in Afghanistan—though that too is true.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Instead, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Obama should not have requested more troops because doing so intensifies opposition to the war</span><span style="color: black;"> in the <span class="caps">US</span> and Europe </span><span class="BoldUnderline">and accelerates the pace of withdrawal demanded by political pressures at home. To keep domestic consent for a long engagement we need to limit troop numbers</span><span style="color: black;"> and in particular limit our casualties. The surge is a Mephistophelian bargain, in which the President has gained force but lost time.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">What can now be done to salvage the administration’s position?</span><span style="color: black;"> Obama has acquired leverage over the generals and some support from the public by making it clear that he will not increase troop strength further. He has gained leverage over Karzai by showing that he has options other than investing in Afghanistan. Now </span><span class="BoldUnderline">he needs to regain leverage over the Taliban by showing them that he is not about to abandon Afghanistan</span> <span style="color: black;">and that their best option is to negotiate. In short, he needs to follow his argument for a call strategy to its conclusion. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">The date of withdrawal should be recast as a time for reduction to a lighter, more sustainable, and more permanent presence</span><span style="color: black;">. This is what the administration began to do in the days following the speech. As National Security Adviser General James Jones said, “That date is a ‘ramp’ rather than a cliff.” And as Hillary Clinton said in her congressional testimony on December 3, their real aim should be to “develop a long-term sustainable relationship with Afghanistan and Pakistan so that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, primarily our abandonment of that region.”</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">A more realistic, affordable, and therefore sustainable presence would not make Afghanistan stable or predictable. It would be merely a small if necessary part of an Afghan political strategy. The </span><span class="caps"><span style="color: black;">US</span></span><span style="color: black;"> and its allies would only moderate, influence, and fund a strategy shaped and led by Afghans themselves. The aim would be to knit together different Afghan interests and allegiances sensitively enough to avoid alienating independent local groups, consistently enough to regain their trust, and robustly enough to restore the security and justice that Afghans demand and deserve from a national government.</span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">What would this look like in practice? Probably a mess. It might involve a tricky coalition of people we refer to, respectively, as Islamists, progressive civil society, terrorists, warlords, learned technocrats, and village chiefs. Under a notionally democratic constitutional structure, it could be a rickety experiment with systems that might, like Afghanistan’s neighbors, include strong elements of religious or military rule. There is no way to predict what the Taliban might become or what authority a national government in Kabul could regain. Civil war would remain a possibility. But an intelligent, long-term, and tolerant partnership with the United States could reduce the likelihood of civil war and increase the likelihood of a political settlement. This is hardly the stuff of sound bites and political slogans. But it would be better for everyone than boom and bust, surge and flight. With the right patient leadership, a political strategy could leave Afghanistan in twenty years’ time more prosperous, stable, and humane than it is today. That would be excellent for Afghans and good for the world.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: black;">Meanwhile, Obama’s broader strategic argument must not be lost. He has grasped that the foreign policy of the president should not consist in a series of extravagant, brief, Manichaean battles, driven by exaggerated fears, grandiloquent promises, and fragile edifices of doctrine. Instead </span><span class="BoldUnderline">the foreign policy of a great power should be the responsible exercise of limited power and knowledge in concurrent situations of radical uncertainty</span><span class="Underline0"><span style="color: black;">.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> Obama, we may hope, will develop this elusive insight. And then <span class="Underline0">it </span></span><span class="BoldUnderline">might become possible to find the right places in which to deploy the wealth, the courage, and the political capital of the U</span><span style="color: black;">nited </span><span class="BoldUnderline">S</span><span style="color: black;">tates. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">We might hope in South Asia</span><span class="Underline0"><span style="color: black;">,</span></span><span style="color: black;"> for example, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">for a lighter involvement in Afghanistan but a much greater focus on Kashmir</span><span style="color: black;">.1</span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Q1: General McChrystal is expected to request up to 40,000 additional troops and recommend a greater focus on counterinsurgency operations. Is this approach likely to succeed in strengthening the Afghan state, defeating the Taliban, and advancing America’s fight against terrorism?</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">A1: Probably not<span class="BoldUnderline">. Counterinsurgency doctrine</span>, or COIN, has captured the hearts and minds of many in the D.C. policy community. Upon close inspection, however, it becomes clear that COIN, at least <span class="BoldUnderline">as applied to Afghanistan, is built on a number of shaky assumptions. Consider:</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.5in; padding: 0px; text-indent: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">1. </span>Even if</span> General <span class="BoldUnderline">McChrystal gets all 40,000 troops</span> he has requested, <span class="BoldUnderline">the combined</span> International Security Assistance Force <span class="BoldUnderline">(ISAF),</span> Operation Enduring Freedom <span class="BoldUnderline">(OEF), and Afghan contingent would still number less than 250,000—far fewer than the 670,000 troops the U.S. Army’s own Counterinsurgency Field Manual suggests is necessary to secure a state of Afghanistan’s size.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.5in; padding: 0px; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">2. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Widespread corruption in the</span> August 20 <span class="BoldUnderline">election has widened the trust gap between the Karzai government and the Afghan people. Because successful counterinsurgency requires a government that is credible and responsive to its citizens, these developments threaten to derail the U.S.</span> and NATO <span class="BoldUnderline">mission</span>. And as our experience in South Vietnam made painfully clear, the White House is usually powerless to force any host nation to enact good-government reforms.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.5in; padding: 0px; text-indent: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">3. </span></span>General <span class="BoldUnderline">McChrystal’s strategic review emphasizes “population protection” as the key to drying up support for the Taliban. The claim is based on the assumption that insurgencies require the backing</span>, or at least acquiescence, <span class="BoldUnderline">of surrounding communities</span> in order to function. <span class="BoldUnderline">But</span> a recent article in the <em>Washington Post</em> noted that <span class="BoldUnderline">the Taliban rely primarily on foreign, rather than local, funding sources, a fact that suggests that population protection may ultimately do little to diminish the insurgency’s strength.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.5in; padding: 0px; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">4. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Public support for a counterinsurgency campaign of such massive proportions simply does not exist</span><span class="Underline0">.</span> Recent polls suggest that over 50 percent of Americans are against sending more troops to Afghanistan. And our European allies are even less enthusiastic about escalating the war. Finally, the COIN framework is built on the larger assumption that eliminating the Taliban and stabilizing Afghanistan is the best use of American resources in the broader effort to combat terrorism. Al Qaeda’s presence in a pre-9/11, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan has convinced many officials that a Taliban takeover would result in al Qaeda’s inevitable return to the state. But al Qaeda already has established itself in Pakistan’s semi-governed spaces. Along with Taliban and other extremist militants, the group enjoys the relative safety of these territories, where Pakistani sovereignty precludes any substantive U.S. ground force. Even if al Qaeda were to reenter Afghanistan sometime in the future, the United States would face the same basic terrorist threats that it does today. Critics will argue that Afghanistan served as a base and planning center for 9/11. True enough; but al Qaeda, in establishing a presence in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen has already developed numerous “safe havens.” In short, <span class="BoldUnderline">our overwhelming focus on Afghanistan fails to serve a more nuanced counterterrorism strategy that acknowledges the many other areas in which al Qaeda operates</span>. Q2: So how should the United States approach the war?</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">A2: We need to reframe our thinking about U.S. goals and the means to achieve them. As outlined above, COIN in Afghanistan is only tenuously linked to counterterrorism, the original purpose of our efforts. <span class="BoldUnderline">The Obama administration should implement a more minimalist policy in the region, one that employs special operations forces and airstrikes to directly target terrorists, especially leaders of cells.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Critics charge that these operations are mere tactical successes, detached from any larger strategy. This is a disingenuous assessment.<span class="BoldUnderline">Targeted strikes do, in fact, serve the greater strategic purpose of disrupting the planning and execution of terrorist attacks. Unlike COIN—which seems to harbor the grandiose notion of eliminating terrorism by transforming societies</span><span class="Underline0">,</span> regardless of cost—<span class="BoldUnderline">counterterrorism acknowledges that radicalism will always exist and that policymakers should directly seek to contain it.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">At the core of this shift is an acknowledgment that our best Afghanistan policy is no better than our best Pakistan policy. ISAF and Afghan forces can do everything imaginable to eliminate Taliban influence in the country, but any effort that does not address the presence of militants in Pakistan’s semi-governed spaces ultimately does little to reduce the threat posed by al Qaeda. At a most basic level, the Obama administration must change the calculus of the Pakistani military and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) with regard to extremists in the country’s northwest. Doing so will force the United States to play a central role in rapprochement between Pakistan and India—and be a fair broker to both parties. What about Afghanistan? Proponents of an “all-in” approach tend to misrepresent a minimalist strategy as complete withdrawal, arguing that the United States abandoned Afghanistan after the Soviet war and that doing so again would plunge the country into anarchy. But few serious analysts are talking about abandoning Afghanistan, and there is no reason to believe that a smaller, more specialized force would not be able to confront any resumption of al Qaeda activity in the country. <span class="BoldUnderline">As far as the Taliban are concerned, there is reason to believe that an ever-larger foreign troop presence simply swells the movement’s ranks</span> (to wit<span class="BoldUnderline">: it has been dismaying to watch increased troop levels correlate with recent Taliban gains).</span> Until the administration can convincingly demonstrate how additional troops will, in fact, support broader national security and counterterrorism goals, the United States is better served by a strategy that minimizes the loss of life and dizzying levels of expenditure that any “all-in” approach would entail.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The &quot;objective&quot; situation in <span class="BoldUnderline">Afghanistan remains a mess. </span>The details are well known. <span class="BoldUnderline">Senior commanders acknowledge that we are not now winning hearts and minds in Afghanistan; indeed, we never can, and certainly not at gunpoint.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Most Pashtuns will never accept a US plan for Afghanistan's future. The non-Pashtuns</span> - Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, etc. <span class="BoldUnderline">- naturally welcome any outside support in what is a virtual civil war. America has inadvertently ended up choosing sides. US forces are perceived by large numbers of Afghans as an occupying army inflicting large civilian casualties</span>. The struggle has now leaked into Pakistan - with even higher stakes.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Obama's policies would seem an unsatisfying compromise among contending arguments. <span class="BoldUnderline">Thirty thousand more troops will not turn the tide; arguably they present more American targets for attack. They will heighten traditional xenophobia against foreigners traipsing through Pashtun villages and homes. It is a fool's errand to persuade the locals in Pashtun territory that the Taliban are the enemy and the US is their friend</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Whatever mixed feelings Pashtuns have toward the Taliban, <span class="BoldUnderline">they know the Taliban remain the single most important element of Pashtun political life; the Taliban will be among them long after Washington tires of this mission</span><span class="Underline0">.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The strategy of the Bush era envisioned Afghanistan as a vital imperial outpost in a post-Soviet dream world where hundreds of overseas US bases would cement US global hegemony, keeping Russia and China in check and the US on top. That world vision is gone - except to a few Washington diehards who haven't grasped the new emerging global architectures of power, economics, prestige, and influence.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The Taliban will inevitably figure significantly in the governance of almost any future Afghanistan, like it or not. Future Taliban leaders, once rid of foreign occupation, will have little incentive to support global jihadi schemes - they never really have by choice. The Taliban inherited bin Laden as a poison pill from the past when they came to power in 1996 and have learned a bitter lesson about what it means to lend state support to a prominent terrorist group.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Taliban with a voice in power will have every incentive to welcome foreign money and expertise into the country, including the Pashtun regions - as long as it is not part of a Western strategic package. An austere Islamic regime is not the ideal outcome for Afghanistan, but it is by far the most realistic. To reverse ground realities and achieve a markedly different outcome is not in the cards and will pose the same dilemma to Obama next year.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Meanwhile<span class="BoldUnderline">, Pakistan will never be willing or able to solve Washington's Afghanistan dilemma. Pakistan's own stability has been brought to the very brink by US demands that it solve America's self-created problem in Afghanistan. Pakistan will eventually be forced to resolve Afghanistan itself - but only after the US has gone,</span> and only by making a pact with Taliban forces both inside Afghanistan and in Pakistan itself. Washington will not accept that for now, but it will ultimately be forced to fairly soon. Maybe the Pakistanis can root out bin Laden, but meanwhile, Al Qaeda has extended its autonomous franchises around the world, and terrorists can train and plan almost anywhere in the world; they do not need Afghanistan.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">By now, as in so many other elements of the Global War on Terror, <span class="BoldUnderline">the US has become more part of the problem than part of the solution. We are sending troops to defend troops that themselves constitute an affront to Afghan nationalism. Only expeditious American withdrawal from Afghanistan will prevent exacerbation of the problem.</span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Are the basic premises of our current policy in Afghanistan fatally flawed?</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The fact that I feel compelled to pose <span class="BoldUnderline">this question</span> so soon after the completion of President Obama’s painstaking review <span class="BoldUnderline">reflects the mounting evidence that the results of that policy have fallen far short of expectations.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Let’s begin at the beginning, with Marja. The holy trinity of modern counterinsurgency is clear, hold, and build. <span class="BoldUnderline">Coalition forces are stalled</span> at step one. <span class="BoldUnderline">After the initial military thrust, many Taliban fighters</span>, including mid-level commanders<span class="BoldUnderline">, swooped back in to the area to intimidate local inhabitants </span>who might otherwise be inclined to cooperate with the coalition and Afghan government. <span class="BoldUnderline">Many other Afghanis sympathize with the core Taliban message that we intend to occupy their country for the long-term with the aim of imposing alien cultural, religious, and political values. It is hard to see what will tip this stalemate in our favor,</span> even harder to see how we can hand over governance and security function to the Afghans in Marja any time soon. Brigadier General Frederick Hodges, one of the leading commanders in southern Afghanistan, puts it this way: “You’ve got to have the governance part ready to go. We talked about doing that in Marja but didn’t realize how hard it was to do. <span class="BoldUnderline">Ultimately, it’s up to the Afghans to step forward.” It’s clear that Hodges is not holding his breath. The</span> next shoe to drop was <span class="BoldUnderline">Kandahar</span><span class="Underline0">.</span>Ever since this Taliban stronghold was identified as a key target, the tension between the U.S. and Afghan governments on this issue has been palpable—so much so that the coalition is now hesitant to call what it has in mind an “offensive.” Just last week, we learned that the<span class="BoldUnderline">operation scheduled to begin in the spring would fall even farther behind schedule</span>. As The New York Times reports, “<span class="BoldUnderline">The Afghan government has not produced the civilian leadership and trained security forces it was to contribute to the effort</span>, U.S. officials said, and <span class="BoldUnderline">the support from Kandaharis that the United States was counting on Karzai to deliver has not materialized</span>.” Stanley <u>McChrystal</u>, the top commander in Afghanistan, <span class="BoldUnderline">has been admirably frank about a core difficulty: the residents of Kandahar are far from sure that they want the protection we claim to be offering them</span><u>.</u></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">On to Kabul, where President <span class="BoldUnderline">Karzai has reportedly lost faith in the coalition’s ability (and that of his own government) to defeat the Taliban and is secretly maneuvering to strike a separate deal with them</span><u>.</u> If these reports are correct—and Susan Rice, our UN ambassador, disputed them on Sunday (though, notably, she offered no new evidence in support of her assertion that Karzai remains a committed partner)—two events appear to be fueling his growing disenchantment: senior American officials’ claims that his reelection lacked legitimacy, and President Obama’s December announcement that he intended to begin reducing the number of American troops by July 2011.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">One might be tempted to chalk up the extent of our difficulties in Afghanistan to tendentious reporting. I was skeptical myself—that is, until I stumbled across a stunning NATO/ISAF report completed in March. This report summarizes the results of an in-depth survey conducted in nine of the 16 districts in Kandahar Province to which researchers could safely gain access. Here are some of the findings:</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Security is viewed everywhere as a major problem. When asked to name the top dangers experienced while traveling on the roads, far more respondents named Afghan National Army and Police checkpoints than roadside bombs, Taliban checkpoints, or criminals. And the Taliban were rated better than ISAF convoys and checkpoints as well</span><u>.</u></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Corruption is viewed as a widespread problem and is experienced by respondents on a regular basis. In fact, 84 percent say that corruption is the main reason for the current conflict. Corruption erodes confidence in the Afghan government, and fully two-thirds of respondents believe that this corruption forces them to seek alternatives to government services and authority. Chillingly, 53 percent regard the Taliban as “incorruptible.”</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The <span class="BoldUnderline">residents</span> of Kandahar <span class="BoldUnderline">overwhelmingly prefer a process of reconciliation to the prospect of continued conflict. Ninety-four percent say that it is better to negotiate with the Taliban than to fight with them</span><u>,</u> and they see grounds for believing that these negotiations will succeed.<span class="BoldUnderline">Eighty-five percent regard the Taliban as “our Afghan brothers</span>” (a phrase President Karzai repeated word for word in his address to the recent jirga), and 81 percent say that the Taliban would lay down their arms if given jobs.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Our military commanders in Afghanistan talk incessantly about the need to “shape” the political context in a given area before beginning activities with a significant military component—but if their own research is correct, our chances of “shaping” Kandahar any time soon range from slim to none. Based on General McChrystal’s own logic, then, we cannot proceed there because a key requirement for success is not fulfilled. And if we can’t prevail in Kandahar, <span class="BoldUnderline">then we’re stuck with the Taliban as a long-term military presence and political force in Afghanistan.</span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">If it is a war against extremists and militancy inside Pakistan, it is a civil war because its origins stem from the US, NATO occupation of neighboring Afghanistan. The conflict should be seen as an extension of the ongoing resistance of the Afghan people to alien domination</span>. It is inaccurate to say that the US invaded Afghanistan because of the 9/11 attacks by Al-Qaeda. Former BBC correspondent George Arney reported on September 18, 2001, that Niaz Naik, the former Pakistani foreign secretary, had told him that he was informed by US officials at a UN-sponsored international contact group on Afghanistan in Berlin during July that year that unless Osama bin Laden were handed over swiftly, America would take military action to kill or capture both Bin Laden and Mullah Omar. The wider objective, however, was to topple the Taliban regime and install a transitional government under King Mohammad Zahir Shah. The invasion was to take place in mid-October 2001. Mr. Naik went on to say that he doubted that the US would have abandoned its plan to invade Afghanistan even if Osama were handed over by the Taliban. Arney's story is corroborated by the Guardian correspondent David Leigh in his report published on September 26, 2001, in which he revealed that the Taliban had received specific warning by the US through secret diplomacy in Berlin in July that the Bush Administration would topple the entire regime militarily unless Osama is extradited to the US. This was part of the larger design of US military, industrial complex to bring about regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. As the US needed bases in Pakistan to accomplish its pre-planned invasion of Afghanistan, the Bush Administration sought to use Islamabad as a cat's paw to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. Fortunately for President Bush, a usurper ruled there, devoid of all legitimacy, legal and moral, and he readily and willingly succumbed to US pressure and made a U-turn by severing all links with the Taliban. He even joined the war against Afghanistan instead of using his leverage with the Taliban to exhaust all means of peaceful settlement of the dispute. The entire region, including Pakistan, was declared a war zone by the US military command, and the flights of all passenger planes were prohibited over a certain altitude, while no merchant ships could enter the harbors of Pakistan, thus bringing maritime trade (which comprises approximately 95 percent of Pakistan's import-export trade) to a standstill. <span class="BoldUnderline">It is no wonder that Pakistan suffered a loss of 34 billion dollars because of its involvement in the Afghan war.</span> America's War As one can see<span class="BoldUnderline">, it was America's war that was imposed upon Pakistan</span>.

This insurgency shows no sign of abatement</span>, as terrorist attacks on military and civilian centers in the capital and major cities of the North-West Frontier Province and Punjab continue with a vengeance, <span class="BoldUnderline">posing threat to the security of the state.</span> In the meantime, routine predator strikes by the US in Waziristan have taken a heavy toll of civilian lives amid accusations of Islamabad's complicity in the piratical attacks on tribespeople, which prompts them to resort to retaliatory strikes on the perpetrators. Not satisfied with Pakistan's military operations in the tribal region, the US Administration has compelled Islamabad's fragile government to pull out its troops from the tense Indo-Pak border and deploy them in the restive tribal belt along the Pak-Afghan border. Now <span class="BoldUnderline">Pakistan faces existential threat from the Taliban</span> and not India, a perception <span class="BoldUnderline">which the country's military leadership is not prepared to share, </span>given the unresolved disputes with New Delhi, which triggered four wars during the last 62 years. At the same time, speculation (not entirely unfounded) is rife about the involvement of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the former Blackwater (now christened Xe Services) in murder, mayhem, and gunrunning as evidenced by the armed Americans who drive consulate vehicles through cities and, when intercepted, refuse to disclose their identity. It is here that one recalls with dismay the role of General Stanley McChrystal, who until last year headed the Joint Special Operations Command, which runs drone attacks and targeted assassinations with the assistance of the operatives of the former Blackwater. This was revealed by Jeremy Scahill's investigative report published in the US weekly the Nation. That may, perhaps, solve the mystery surrounding a series of assassinations of ulama belonging to various Islamic movements. The sinister motive behind such acts of terror is to incite sectarian violence in Pakistan and lay the blame at the doors of religious extremists. Similar death squads were organized by the CIA in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to carry out political assassinations of nationalists who were opposed to US intervention. At the time, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua complained to the International Court of Justice about the mining of Nicaraguan ports, the violation of the country's airspace, the killing and kidnapping of individuals on the Nicaraguan territory, and the threat or use of force by the US. The court in its decision in June 1986 held that the US was in breach of the customary rules of international law and international humanitarian law. The above case is titled the &quot;Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua.&quot; The precedent set by this case may be invoked by Pakistan to prevent the US drone attacks on its territory. Once the piratical attacks of the US have stopped, the irritant in the tribal insurgency would have gone, paving the way for pacification of the conflict. If this were Pakistan's war, the government would have exercised its own judgment in dealing with the militants at home, either by conciliation or by resort to force. But Islamabad's so-called operation against militants is subordinated to US military designs in the region, aimed at the encirclement of the People's Republic of China and the control of the transit of gas pipelines from Central Asia to South Asia. It is not aimless that China expressed its concern over the concentration of US, NATO troops in the region. India fits in the American scheme of things, hence the US-India nuclear deal.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Pakistan's National Interest <span class="BoldUnderline">In this emerging security environment, Pakistan will have to be content with its role as a junior partner of India. Therefore, the sooner Islamabad extricates itself from the US &quot;war on terror,&quot; the better it is for its security and independence.</span> Doesn't Islamabad realize that its military operation against the militants would leave its border with India vulnerable to a New Delhi offensive? If Pakistan permits the US to attack the suspected training centers of militants on its territory, will it be able to prevent India from doing so? With Islamabad embroiled in internecine strife, it cannot negotiate with India from a position of strength. It may be forced to make a compromise that might be detrimental to its national interest. <span class="BoldUnderline">Pakistan's preoccupation with tribal rebellion would not permit it to deal with separatist ethnic forces in Baluchistan. Undoubtedly, this is a threat to the territorial integrity of Pakistan.</span> After the total failure of the military operation in Baluchistan, the federal government has come round to the painful conclusion that political and not military action can bring militancy to an end. Granting general amnesty to the dissidents and engaging them in a meaningful dialogue on contentious issues is a laudable initiative. The same gesture should be made to the militants in the tribal areas. But Islamabad has adopted double standards in dealing with the Baluchistan militants and the Pashtun militants, as if there were good militants and bad ones. This discriminatory policy would intensify the Pashtun insurgency and might drive them toward even more escalation. The rulers have seen the consequences of military operations in the former East Pakistan, Baluchistan, Karachi, Sind, and FATA (federally administered tribal areas). If anything, <span class="BoldUnderline">the situation has only worsened. The surge of US troops, the expansion of war beyond the borders of Afghanistan, and the attacks on Quetta and Muridke as envisaged by Obama's new strategy would mean that US troops are at war with the people of Pakistan</span><u>.</u></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Any Solution?</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The Obama Administration would be better advised to concentrate on its exit strategy, </span>and to that end, it is imperative that it involve the UN in its peace-making efforts aimed at the establishment of a broad-based government in Afghanistan, because the Karzai Government has no legitimacy. To fill the vacuum, the UN peacekeeping force, made up of troops of states not involved in the Afghan war, may be deployed until a government of national unity is able to assume full responsibility. Here the US can contribute to the postwar reconstruction of Afghanistan under the aegis of the UN. <span class="BoldUnderline">The insurgency in the tribal region is the spillover effect of US military occupation of Afghanistan, but Pakistan faces a far greater threat: the threat of ethnic violence as manifested in the bloody clashes among various linguistic groups in urban and rural Sind. These have been overshadowed by the counterinsurgency operations in FATA, but they may erupt at any moment, thus destabilizing the state</span><u>.</u></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep filled with troops today, killing five and wounding as many as 21, including several children who were waiting for a ride to school. Residents of the region where the attack took place are fleeing in terror as gunfire rings out around them, and government forces have been unable to quell the violence. Two regional government officials were beheaded by militants in retaliation for the killing of other militants by government forces. As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where we have come to expect such terrible events. This, unfortunately, is a whole new ballgame. It is part of another conflict that is brewing, one which puts what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in deep shade, and which represents a grave and growing threat to us all<span class="BoldUnderline">. Pakistan is now trembling on the edge of violent chaos</span>, and is doing so <span class="BoldUnderline">with nuclear weapons</span> in its hip pocket, <span class="BoldUnderline">right in the middle of one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world</span><u>.</u> The situation in brief: Pakistan for years has been a nation in turmoil, run by a shaky government supported by a corrupted system, dominated by a blatantly criminal security service, and threatened by a large fundamentalist Islamic population with deep ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan. All this is piled atop an ongoing standoff with neighboring India that has been the center of political gravity in the region for more than half a century. <span class="BoldUnderline">The fact that Pakistan, and India, and Russia, and China all possess nuclear weapons and share the same space means any ongoing or escalating violence over there has the real potential to crack open the very gates of Hell itself.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Recently, the Taliban made a military push into the northwest Pakistani region around the Swat Valley</span><u>.</u> According to a recent Reuters report<u>:</u>The (Pakistani) army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control. But insecurity mounted after a civilian government came to power last year and tried to reach a negotiated settlement. A peace accord fell apart in May 2008. After that, hundreds — including soldiers, militants and civilians — died in battles. Militants unleashed a reign of terror, killing and beheading politicians, singers, soldiers and opponents. They banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls' schools. About 1,200 people were killed since late 2007 and 250,000 to 500,000 fled, leaving the militants in virtual control. Pakistan offered on February 16 to introduce Islamic law in the Swat valley and neighboring areas in a bid to take the steam out of the insurgency. The militants announced an indefinite cease-fire after the army said it was halting operations in the region. President Asif Ali Zardari signed a regulation imposing sharia in the area last month. But the Taliban refused to give up their guns and pushed into Buner and another district adjacent to Swat, intent on spreading their rule. <span class="BoldUnderline">The United States, already embroiled in a war against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, must now face the possibility that Pakistan could collapse under the mounting threat of Taliban forces there</span>. Military and diplomatic advisers to President Obama, uncertain how best to proceed, now face one of the great nightmare scenarios of our time. &quot;Recent militant gains in Pakistan,&quot; reported The New York Times on Monday, &quot;have so alarmed the White House that the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the situation as 'one of the very most serious problems we face.'&quot; <u>&quot;</u>Security was deteriorating rapidly,&quot; reported The Washington Post on Monday, &quot;particularly in the mountains along the Afghan border that harbor al-Qaeda and the Taliban, intelligence chiefs reported, and there were signs that those groups were working with indigenous extremists in Pakistan's populous Punjabi heartland. The Pakistani government was mired in political bickering. The army, still fixated on its historical adversary India, remained ill-equipped and unwilling to throw its full weight into the counterinsurgency fight. But despite the threat the intelligence conveyed, Obama has only limited options for dealing with it. Anti-American feeling in Pakistan is high, and a U.S. combat presence is prohibited. The United States is fighting Pakistan-based extremists by proxy, through an army over which it has little control, in alliance with a government in which it has little confidence.&quot; It is believed <span class="BoldUnderline">Pakistan is currently in possession of between 60 and 100 nuclear weapons.</span> Because Pakistan's stability is threatened by the wide swath of its population that shares ethnic, cultural and religious connections to the fundamentalist Islamic populace of Afghanistan, fears over what could happen to those nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government collapses are very real. <span class="BoldUnderline">&quot;As the insurgency of the Taliban and Al Qaeda spreads in Pakistan,&quot; reported the Times last week, &quot;senior American officials say they are increasingly concerned about new vulnerabilities for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, including the potential for militants to snatch a weapon in transport or to insert sympathizers into laboratories or fuel-production facilities</span><u>.</u> In public, the administration has only hinted at those concerns, repeating the formulation that the Bush administration used: that it has faith in the Pakistani Army. But that cooperation, according to officials who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity surrounding the exchanges between Washington and Islamabad, has been sharply limited when the subject has turned to the vulnerabilities in the Pakistani nuclear infrastructure.&quot; &quot;The prospect of turmoil in Pakistan sends shivers up the spines of those U.S. officials charged with keeping tabs on foreign nuclear weapons,&quot; reported Time Magazine last month. &quot;Pakistan is thought to possess about 100 — the U.S. isn't sure of the total, and may not know where all of them are. Still, if Pakistan collapses, the U.S. military is primed to enter the country and secure as many of those weapons as it can, according to U.S. officials. Pakistani officials insist their personnel safeguards are stringent, but a sleeper cell could cause big trouble, U.S. officials say.&quot; In other words, a shaky Pakistan spells trouble for everyone, especially if America loses the footrace to secure those weapons in the event of the worst-case scenario. <span class="BoldUnderline">If Pakistani militants ever succeed in toppling the government,</span> several very dangerous events could happen at once. Nuclear-armed <span class="BoldUnderline">India could be galvanized into military action</span> of some kind, <span class="BoldUnderline">as could</span> nuclear-armed <span class="BoldUnderline">China or</span> nuclear-armed <span class="BoldUnderline">Russia</span><u>.</u> If the Pakistani government does fall, and all those Pakistani nukes are not immediately accounted for and secured, the specter (or reality) of <span class="BoldUnderline">loose nukes falling into the hands of terrorist organizations could place the entire world on a collision course with unimaginable disaster.</span> We have all been paying a great deal of attention to Iraq and Afghanistan, and rightly so. The developing situation in Pakistan, however, needs to be placed immediately on the front burner. The Obama administration appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all.</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">“The likelihood of a single nuclear bomb exploding in a single city somewhere, maybe even Boston, has increased</span>,<span class="BoldUnderline">’’ said</span> Graham <span class="BoldUnderline">Allison, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. </span>Allison is one of several talking heads featured in the documentary. <span class="BoldUnderline">The technology is spreading, terrorists have an appetite for the arms, and the security of nuclear bombs, particularly in Pakistan</span> and the countries of the former Soviet Union, <span class="BoldUnderline">is a constant worry for</span> US and allied defense officials. But to people worried more about mortgage payments than nuclear holocaust, the danger can seem as dated as fallout shelters and “Dr. Strangelove.’’ Because of that sense of complacency, an area network of clergy, academics, and scientists is spreading the word that this issue must not be overlooked. “Nuclear weapons were so much the story line of the Cold War,’’ said Allison, who served as assistant defense secretary under President Clinton and a special defense adviser under President Reagan. “If you’re only following the headlines — ‘The Cold War’s Over’ — it must have gone away.’’ Instead, Allison said, <span class="BoldUnderline">an apocalyptic danger is clear and present. “The objective of Al Qaeda is to ‘kill 4 million Americans</span><span class="Underline0">, </span>including 2 million children,’ ’’ Allison says during the 90-minute film. “You’re not going to get to kill 4 million people by hijacking airplanes and crashing them into buildings.’’ <span class="BoldUnderline">The quickest way to reach that goal is through the cataclysm of a nuclear explosion, which</span> Valerie Plame Wilson, the former CIA officer whose identity was leaked by aides under President George W. Bush, said <span class="BoldUnderline">Al Qaeda is eager to accomplish. “Al Qaeda is determined to acquire nuclear weapons and to use them if they get them</span><span class="Underline0">,’’ </span>Wilson says in the film. “In the early ’90s, they tried to buy highly enriched uranium in the Sudan. They got scammed. Just prior to the 9/11 attacks, we do know that Osama bin Laden and his lieutenant, Zawahiri, sat down with two Pakistani nuclear scientists and discussed nuclear weapons.’’ “Countdown to Zero’’ was produced by Lawrence Bender, who brought the issue of global warming to a mass audience through “An Inconvenient Truth,’’ the Academy Award-winning documentary. In Allison’s view, nuclear proliferation is a much more immediate danger. In addition to showing the history of the atomic bomb, the film includes interviews of world figures such as Mikhail Gorbachev, Tony Blair, and Pervez Musharraf; nuclear scientists; and intelligence officials such as former CIA operative Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a current fellow at the Belfer Center. “Countdown to Zero’’ includes the troubling and well-known development of Iran’s nuclear program, but its writer and director, Lucy Walker, also chronicles little-publicized thefts of enriched uranium that show this fear has been more reality than rumor. As Mowatt-Larssen says in the film: “<span class="BoldUnderline">There are three ways to acquire a nuclear weapon: You can steal a bomb. You can buy a bomb. And you can build a bomb.’’</span> Walker shows that <span class="BoldUnderline">all three options are very much in play</span>. According to Dr. Ira Helfand of Northampton, former president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, <span class="BoldUnderline">even a relatively small nuclear exchange</span> between, for example, India and Pakistan <span class="BoldUnderline">would have serious global repercussions</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Temperatures across the planet would drop about 1.3 degrees centigrade</span>, Helfand said<span class="BoldUnderline">, and lead to mass starvation. In a large-scale nuclear war, temperatures would drop 8 to 10 degrees centigrade, agriculture would be devastated, and</span> “the likelihood is that <span class="BoldUnderline">the entire human race would starve to death,’</span>’ Helfand said during a panel discussion after a recent screening at the Coolidge Corner Theatre in Brookline. “Countdown to Zero,’’ developed by Participant Media in conjunction with the World Security Institute and Magnolia Pictures, has been shown at the Cannes and Sundance film festivals. However, the sparse turnout at the Brookline screening underscored the difficulties that the documentary faces in attracting a large, paying audience. “We have kind of an issue fatigue that all of us understandably experience,’’ said the Rev. Jim Antal, president of the Massachusetts Conference of the United Church of Christ, who also spoke after the screening. To help counter that fatigue, Antal plans to send an alert to all of the 400 churches and clergy in his jurisdiction. “This problem has not gone away,’’ Antal said. The issue of complacency or unawareness might be even more acute among younger people who have no recollection of the Cold War and its hair-trigger threat of nuclear annihilation. Ryan Scott McDonnell, executive director of the Boston Faith &amp; Justice Network, said the group will be encouraging its 5,000 young men and women to watch the film. “This is a first step to convince people that this is an issue that you at least need to learn about even before you care about it,’’ McDonnell said. “But that’s just the starting point.’’ Despite the seemingly increasing nuclear threat posed by terrorists and rogue organizations, some activists see more opportunities for large-scale disarmament. The United States and Russia already have dramatically reduced their nuclear arsenals, and Presidents Obama and Dmitry Medvedev have pledged to eliminate even more weapons. The Nobel Peace Prize committee made Obama its 2009 recipient partly because of his support for universal nuclear disarmament. And that effort, by the leader of one of the world’s two nuclear giants, is an important reason for hope, Antal said. “This is an unprecedented opportunity for humanity to put the genie back in the bottle,’’ Antal said. “To have a person of Obama’s values in his position, and his relations with the Russians, I just think this is something that can give the world hope.’’ Time, however, might be running short. Allison said that while the threat of all-out nuclear war has declined<span class="BoldUnderline">, the rise of terrorism continues to make the intersection of motive and materials a wildly unpredictable one</span><span class="Underline0">. </span>Indeed, Allison said in a phone interview, the findings of a congressionally appointed committee on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism underscored the dangers. Allison, who was a member of that committee, recounted its conclusions from 2008. “We said that <span class="BoldUnderline">unless there’s some significant, change</span> from the current trend lines, we believed <span class="BoldUnderline">it was more likely than not that there would be a successful nuclear or biological attack somewhere in the world before the end of 2013</span><span class="Underline0">,</span>’’ Allison said.</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Here are the issues. Number one, both Peter and Ivan have talked about this, <span class="BoldUnderline">the Taliban is not monolithic. We here in the United States tend to equate the Taliban with Al Qaeda. They’re not one and the same. There are elements of the Taliban that would support Al Qaeda in wanting to attack the United States. There are other elements of the Taliban that are just interested in having a say in the government in Afghanistan. We’ve got to stop treating them monolithically as a single threat as if somehow they are a threat to the United States of America proper. They’re not</span><span class="Underline0">.</span> We have to be willing to live with less than perfect in terms of what happens in Afghanistan, and I also think that we have to be willing to concede at this point that what’s left of Al Qaeda, whether they’re operating out of Pakistan or coming across the boarder periodically into Afghanistan. And by the way I saw a news report that supposedly even Bin Laden—assuming he’s still alive—finds his way across the border into Afghanistan periodically. <span class="BoldUnderline">Al Qaeda isn’t the same Al Qaeda that existed, that attacked us on 9/11, and Bin Laden in particular does not have operational control over a group that has global reach that can attack the United States</span><span class="Underline0">. </span>Our larger problem is not Osama Bin Laden and what is left of Al Qaeda hiding out in Pakistan<span class="BoldUnderline">. Our larger problem is the ideology of radical Islam, which has seeped into the Muslim world in part because we’ve helped propagate that by our actions in places</span> like Iraq and Afghanistan<span class="BoldUnderline">. I would argue that whatever benefit there might be to getting Bin Laden at this point, and believe me I would love to be able to say that we got Osama Bin Laden, but strategically the costs required to try and get Bin Laden and contain Al Qaeda far outweigh any residual benefit at this stage</span>. Bin Laden and the people surrounding him no longer represent operationally the real threat to the United States. <span class="Underline0">The </span><span class="BoldUnderline">real threat is sort of everywhere within the Muslim world being fueled by ideology and anti-American sentiment</span><span class="Underline0">.</span> So <span class="BoldUnderline">this notion of denying Al Qaeda safe haven in Afghanistan, I think, is a pie-in-the-sky notion. Al Qaeda—there will be some safe havens</span>. Why? Because there will always be people who have sympathies and decide they want to support groups like Al Qaeda. The question is, are they local threats or global threats? As long as they are local threats, then those are threats that the Afghan government has to deal with and ones that we may have to live with—again, less than perfect<span class="Underline0">. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">It’s the global threat that Al Qaeda may represent that we have to worry about. I think we have to worry about that less now than we did eight years ago. I think we have to worry more that we are radicalizing Muslims around the world</span>, as witnessed by the bombings in Madrid and London in particular. <span class="BoldUnderline">Our very presence</span> in two Muslim countries at the moment, Iraq and Afghanistan, <span class="BoldUnderline">goes a long, long way to fueling that radicalism that it’s U.S. occupation that makes us a target</span>. There may be a certain amount of anti-Western, anti-U.S. elements in radical Islamic ideology, but <span class="BoldUnderline">most of that is because we’re there in their territories, not necessarily that they want to come after the United States in the U.S.</span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>Nuclear terrorism is an existential threat—it escalates to nuclear war with Russia and China.</strong></span><br />

<span style="background-color: #f4f5f7; line-height: 10.2pt; margin: 0px 0px 6pt; padding: 0px;">A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by the country attacked in the first place, would not necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds imaginable. Indeed, <span class="BoldUnderline">there are reasons to wonder whether nuclear terrorism should ever be regarded as belonging in the category of truly existential threats. A contrast can be drawn here with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear exchange</span> between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these weapons in significant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the twenty-first century might bring would fade into insignificance alongside considerations of what a general nuclear war would have wrought in the Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as the major nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of nuclear weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a truly awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state possessors themselves. <span class="BoldUnderline">But these two nuclear worlds</span>—<span class="BoldUnderline">a non-state actor nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange</span>—<span class="BoldUnderline">are not <span style="text-decoration: none;">necessarily</span> separable</span>. It is just possible that <span class="BoldUnderline">some sort of terrorist attack</span>, and especially an act of nuclear terrorism, <span class="BoldUnderline">could precipitate a chain of events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapons</span> between two or more of the states that possess them. In this context, today’s and tomorrow’s terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the early Cold War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals who were seen as raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war between the superpowers started by third parties. These risks were considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem. <span class="BoldUnderline">It may require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially plausible situation where an act of nuclear terrorism could lead to such a massive inter-state nuclear war</span>. For example, in the event of a terrorist nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered just how Russia and/or China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not least because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far too responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist behavior that could just as easily threaten them as well. Some possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example, how might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that the fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from Russian stocks,40 and if for some reason Moscow denied any responsibility for nuclear laxity? The correct attribution of that nuclear material to a particular country might not be a case of science fiction given the observation by Michael May et al. that while the debris resulting from a nuclear explosion would be “spread over a wide area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable, identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of information can be obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the explosion, the materials used and, most important … some indication of where the nuclear material came from.”41 Alternatively, <span class="BoldUnderline">if the act of nuclear terrorism came as a complete surprise,</span> and American officials refused to believe that a terrorist group was fully responsible (or responsible at all) <span class="BoldUnderline">suspicion would shift immediately to state possessors. Ruling out Western ally countries</span> like the United Kingdom and France, and probably Israel and India as well, authorities in <span class="BoldUnderline">Washington would be left with a very short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran</span> if its program continues, <span class="BoldUnderline">and possibly Pakistan. But at what stage would Russia and China be definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear Clue do? </span>In particular, <span class="BoldUnderline">if the act of nuclear terrorism occurred against a backdrop of existing tension in Washington’s relations with Russia and/or China, and at a time when threats had already been traded between these major powers, would officials and political leaders not be tempted to assume the worst?</span> Of course, the chances of this occurring would only seem to increase if the United States was already involved in some sort of limited armed conflict with Russia and/or China, or if they were confronting each other from a distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments may seem at the present time. The reverse might well apply too: should a nuclear terrorist attack occur in Russia or China during a period of heightened tension or even limited conflict with the United States, could Moscow and Beijing resist the pressures that might rise domestically to consider the United States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of the attack?<span class="BoldUnderline">Washington’s early response to a terrorist nuclear attack</span> on its own soil <span class="BoldUnderline">might</span> also <span class="BoldUnderline">raise the possibility of an unwanted (and nuclear aided) confrontation with Russia and/or China</span>. For example, <span class="BoldUnderline">in the noise and confusion during the immediate aftermath</span> of the terrorist nuclear attack, <span class="BoldUnderline">the U.S. president might be expected to place the country’s armed forces, including its nuclear arsenal, on a higher stage of alert. In such a tense environment</span>, when careful planning runs up against the friction of reality, <span class="BoldUnderline">it is just possible that Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intentions to use force (and possibly nuclear force) against them. In that situation, the temptations to preempt such actions might grow</span>, although it must be admitted that <span class="BoldUnderline">any preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response. As part of its initial response</span> to the act of nuclear terrorism (as discussed earlier)<span class="BoldUnderline">Washington might decide to order a significant conventional (or nuclear) retaliatory or disarming attack against the leadership of the terrorist group and/or states seen to support that group</span>. Depending on the identity and especially the location of these targets, <span class="BoldUnderline">Russia and/or China might interpret such action as being far too close for their comfort, and potentially as an infringement on their spheres of influence and even on their sovereignty</span>. One far-fetched but perhaps not impossible scenario might stem from a judgment in Washington that some of the main aiders and abetters of the terrorist action resided somewhere such as Chechnya, perhaps in connection with what Allison claims is the “Chechen insurgents’ … long-standing interest in all things nuclear.”42 American pressure on that part of the world would almost certainly raise alarms in Moscow that might require a degree of advanced consultation from Washington that the latter found itself unable or unwilling to provide. <span class="BoldUnderline">There is also the question of how other nuclear-armed states respond to the act of nuclear terrorism on another member of that special club.</span> It could reasonably be expected that following a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States, both Russia and China would extend immediate sympathy and support to Washington and would work alongside the United States in the Security Council. But there is just a chance, albeit a slim one, where the support of Russia and/or China is less automatic in some cases than in others. For example, what would happen if the United States wished to discuss its right to retaliate against groups based in their territory? If, for some reason, Washington found the responses of Russia and China deeply underwhelming, (neither “for us or against us”) might it also suspect that they secretly were in cahoots with the group, increasing (again perhaps ever so slightly) the chances of a major exchange. If the terrorist group had some connections to groups in Russia and China, or existed in areas of the world over which Russia and China held sway, and if Washington felt that Moscow or Beijing were placing a curiously modest level of pressure on them, what conclusions might it then draw about their culpability? If Washington decided to use, or decided to threaten the use of, nuclear weapons, the responses of Russia and China would be crucial to the chances of avoiding a more serious nuclear exchange. They might surmise, for example, that while the act of nuclear terrorism was especially heinous and demanded a strong response, the response simply had to remain below the nuclear threshold. It would be one thing for a non-state actor to have broken the nuclear use taboo, but an entirely different thing for a state actor, and indeed the leading state in the international system, to do so. If Russia and China felt sufficiently strongly about that prospect, there is then the question of what options would lie open to them to dissuade the United States from such action: and as has been seen over the last several decades, the central dissuader of the use of nuclear weapons by states has been the threat of nuclear retaliation. <span class="BoldUnderline">If some</span> readers <span class="BoldUnderline">find this simply too fanciful,</span> and perhaps even offensive to contemplate, <span class="BoldUnderline">it may be informative to reverse the tables. Russia,</span> which possesses an arsenal of thousands of nuclear warheads and that has been one of the two most important trustees of the non-use taboo, <span class="BoldUnderline">is subjected to an attack of nuclear terrorism. In response, Moscow places its nuclear forces very visibly on a higher state of alert and declares that it is considering the use of nuclear retaliation against the group and any of its state supporters. How would Washington view such a possibility?</span> Would it really be keen to support Russia’s use of nuclear weapons, including outside Russia’s traditional sphere of influence? And if not, which seems quite plausible, what options would Washington have to communicate that displeasure? <span class="BoldUnderline">If China had been the victim of the nuclear terrorism and seemed likely to retaliate in kind, would the United States and Russia be happy to sit back and let this occur? In the charged atmosphere immediately after a nuclear terrorist attack, how would the attacked country respond to pressure from other major nuclear powers not to respond in kind? The phrase “how dare they tell us what to do” immediately springs to mind. Some might even go so far as to interpret this concern as a tacit form of sympathy or support for the terrorists. This might not help the chances of nuclear restraint.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">When the administration's principal war target is not the Taliban but rather al-Qaida remnants on the run, why chase a troop-intensive strategy pivoted on protecting population centers to win grassroots support? In reality, what it calls a &quot;clear, hold, build&quot; strategy is actually a &quot;surge, bribe, run&quot; strategy, except that the muddled nature of the mission and the deepening U.S. involvement crimp the &quot;run&quot; option.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">America's quandary is a reminder that it is easier to get into a war than to get out. In fact, Obama undermined his unfolding war strategy last March by publicly declaring, &quot;There's got to be an exit strategy.&quot; The message that sent to the Taliban and its sponsor, the Pakistani military, was that they ought to simply out-wait the Americans to reclaim Afghanistan.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Before Afghanistan becomes a Vietnam-style quagmire, Obama must rethink his plan for another troop surge. Gradually drawing down U.S. troop levels indeed makes more sense because what holds the disparate constituents of the Taliban syndicate together is a common opposition to foreign military presence.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">An American military exit from Afghanistan will not come as a shot in the arm for the forces of global jihad, as many in Washington seem to fear. To the contrary, it will remove the common unifying element and unleash developments whose significance would be largely internal or regional. In Afghanistan, a vicious power struggle would break out along sectarian and ethnic lines. The Taliban, with the active support of the Pakistani military, would certainly make a run for Kabul to replay the 1996 power grab.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">But it won't be easy to repeat 1996. For one, the Taliban is splintered today, with the tail (private armies and militias) wagging the dog. For another, the non-Taliban and non-Pashtun forces now are stronger, more organized and better prepared than in 1996</span> to resist the Taliban's advance to Kabul, having been empowered by the autonomy they have enjoyed in provinces or by the offices they still hold in the Afghan federal government.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Also, by retaining Afghan bases to carry out covert operations and Predator missions and other airstrikes, the U.S. military would be able to unleash punitive air power to prevent a 1996 repeat</span><span class="Underline0">.</span>After all, it was the combination of American air power and the Northern Alliance's ground operations that ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Against this background, the most likely outcome of the Afghan power struggle triggered by an American decision to pull out would be the formalization of the present de facto partition of Afghanistan along ethnic lines. Iraq, too, is headed in the same direction.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras and other ethnic minorities would be able to ensure self-governance in the Afghan areas they dominate, leaving the Pashtun lands on both sides of the British-drawn Durand Line in ferment. Thanks to ethnic polarization, the Durand Line, or the Afpak border, exists today only on maps. On the ground, it has little political, ethnic and economic relevance.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">As in Iraq, an American withdrawal would potentially let loose forces of Balkanization in the Afpak belt. That may sound disturbing, but this would be an unintended and perhaps unstoppable consequence of the U.S. invasion.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">An American pullout actually would aid the fight against international terrorism. Instead of staying bogged down in Afghanistan and seeking to cajole and bribe the Pakistani military from continuing to provide succor to Islamic militants, Washington would become free to pursue a broader and more-balanced counterterrorism strategy.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Also, minus the Afghan-war burden, the U.S. would better appreciate the dangers to international security posed by Pakistani terror groups</span>like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e- Mohammed<span class="BoldUnderline">. The threat of an Islamist takeover of Pakistan comes not from the Taliban but from these groups that have long drawn support from the Pakistani army as part of the deep-rooted military-mullah alliance.</span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>And, this strategy maximizes US influence in Central Asia to contain instability and terrorism</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">An effort on that scale would garner majority US domestic support only if the public sees likely victory and Congress, the White House and the Beltway punditry line up decisively behind the policy. The emerging trends are pointing in the contrary direction. As monthly and annual US casualties in Afghanistan reached historical peaks in August 2009, and the Afghan national election loomed, a poll conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post indicated that most Americans did not support an extended US military commitment in Afghanistan.<span style="color: black;">31</span>Congressional Democrats are balking at anticipated requests for more troops.<span style="color: black;">32</span> And even conservative columnists, like the influential George F. Will, have turned against a maximalist Afghanistan policy.<span style="color: black;">33</span>Overall<span class="BoldUnderline">, increasingly strong perceptions of the Karzai government as inept and corrupt are making prospects that the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">could enlist it as an effective counter-insurgency partner and lend it the legitimacy required to rebuild the country seem more and more baseless</span><span class="Underline0">.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The upshot is that <span class="BoldUnderline">only if the United States establishes a well-calibrated limited policy now will it have the political flexibility to sustain it over the longer-term and thereby to effectively contain the jihadist threat in Central Asia. If</span><span class="Underline0">, </span>on the other hand, the<span class="BoldUnderline"> Obama</span> administration <span class="BoldUnderline">promises more than it can deliver in Afghanistan, a reprise of Vietnam may occur: once failure becomes clear, domestic support will evaporate, the administration will be compelled to withdraw precipitously, and the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">will lose considerable traction in the region</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Congressional democrats are balking at anticipated requests for more troops</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">These factors suggest that <span class="BoldUnderline">the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">should limit its Afghanistan/Pakistan policy to counter-terrorism and disown country-wide counterinsurgency and state-building in Afghanistan</span>. At the same time, Washington must remain highly sensitive to the dynamic whereby decreased military activity in Afghanistan combined with robust operations in Pakistan could induce al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan and render it a main threat once again. In that light, <span class="BoldUnderline">any abrupt wholesale American military withdrawal from Afghanistan would be too risky. Instead, the United States should seek to facilitate a glide-path to a substantial drawdown - and with it fewer casualties and lower expenditures in Afghanistan - over the next few years</span><span class="Underline0">.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Doing so would involve continuing to suppress al-Qaeda in Pakistan with selective and discriminate drone strikes and denying al-Qaeda access to Afghanistan</span>. The former would require bases within Afghan territory from which to deploy airpower and special-operations forces against terrorists and terrorist infrastructure, as well as the troops and equipment to secure these bases. The latter would call for reinforced border security and force protection within Afghanistan, which in themselves would entail a surprisingly large number of soldiers. For these purposes, <span class="BoldUnderline">the U</span>nited<span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">would continue to bring extensive human intelligence and surveillance capabilities to bear on Afghanistan to detect and assess potential threats to American interests. To mitigate and eliminate such threats, the generous deployment of US special-operations forces to Afghanista</span><span class="Underline0">n</span> - which currently comprises some 50% of all US special-operations personnel - <span class="BoldUnderline">would have to be maintained over the medium term.</span> Meanwhile, <span class="BoldUnderline">US train-and-equip programmes for Afghan security forces should be intensified in contemplation of a gradual and controlled hand-off of the domestic counter-terrorism mission to them when they are ready, as well as to prepare them for counterinsurgency operations, should the Afghan government wish to use them for that purpose.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The United States should also provide strong political and economic support for the Afghan government, which is likely to remain under Karzai once the votes of the 20 August election are counted and certified. Kabul, however, should be left to take the lead in managing its relationship with the Taliban (as well as anti-narcotics policy). With US encouragement, the Karzai government should make it clear to Pashtuns in the southern and eastern parts of the country that if they support insurgents or terrorists aiming to destabilise the Afghan or Pakistani governments, they will suffer financially and militarily. Again, some US forces would be needed to give such arrangements teeth, but not at the levels required for an all-out counter-insurgency. American insurance against a militant Islamist coup or an uncontrollable level of destabilisation also should be left in place. This could entail a standby stabilisation force with tactical air capabilities based in or near Kabul, along with a robust quick-reaction force.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span class="BoldUnderline">That policy would reflect the reality that a deeply committed counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan is potentially counterproductive, probably unwinnable and in any event unnecessary. The United States can protect its interests and fulfil its international security obligations with a far more circumscribed counter-terrorism effort focused on Pakistan</span>. Under such an approach, US policy would recognise Afghanistan as the residual problem that it has, in fact, become.</span><br />

<span style="color: #002561; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Why Withdraw the Combat Troops ? Reframing the War</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">There is an argument against withdrawing combat troops: namely, that al-Qaeda would retain its sanctuary in Afghanistan because the Afghan state would not have control of some parts of the country, especially in the east. Though superficially compelling, this argument is weak for two reasons. First, the international coalition lacks the resources to control the periphery of the Afghan territory anyway. Second, <span class="BoldUnderline">the withdrawal of combat troops does not preclude targeted operations with the agreement of the Kabul government</span>. So, in terms of physical security, <span class="BoldUnderline">the withdrawal of combat troops does not bring clear gains for al-Qaeda.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">There are two important reasons for withdrawal.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">First, <span class="BoldUnderline">the mere presence of foreign soldiers fighting a war in Afghanistan is probably the single most important factor in the resurgence of the Taliban</span><u>.</u> The convergence of nationalism and Jihad has aided the Taliban in extending its influence. It is sometimes frightening to see how similar NATO military operations are to Soviet ones in the 1980s and how the similarities could affect the perceptions of the population. <span class="BoldUnderline">The majority of Afghans are now deeply opposed to the foreign troops on their soil. The idea that one can “stabilize” Afghanistan with more troops goes against all that one should have learned from the Soviet war</span><strong><u>.</u></strong> The real issue is not to “stabilize” but to create a new dynamic. The Taliban have successfully framed the war as a Jihad and a liberation war against (non-Muslim) foreign armies. The concrete consequence of this moral victory is that the movement has been able to gain ground in non-Pashtun areas. The situations in Badghris Province (northwest) and in Badakhshan Province (northeast) are extremely worrisome, because the Taliban have been able to attract the support of some Pashtun tribes and fundamentalist networks. A province like Wardak, initially opposed to the Taliban in the 1990s, is now one of its strongholds. Insecurity bred by the narcotics trade and the infighting of local groups in the north also provides the Taliban opportunities to find new allies on a more practical, rather than ideological, ground.

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Second, <span class="BoldUnderline">withdrawal would create a new dynamic in the country, providing two main benefits.

<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">WASHINGTON -- For the first time <span style="background-position: 100% 50%; color: #0000f6; cursor: pointer; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foxnews.com/topics/politics/the-pentagon.htm#r_src=ramp" rel="nofollow">the Pentagon</a></span> has mentioned the year 2015 as a date for the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Pentagon Spokesman Geoff Morrell said Thursday the administration hopes to transfer security to Afghanistan by the end of 2014, &quot;so effectively it's by 2015.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The statement represents a slight shift in language from a strategy that pointed originally to sometime 2014.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">He called the start 2015 is an &quot;aspirational goal&quot; for the transfer of security, not a deadline for U.S. withdrawal.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Pentagon can't predict how many U.S. troops would remain on the ground in Afghanistan in 2015 if that goal is met. &quot;I don't think anybody could tell you with any -- with any credence what the force posture will be four years from now,&quot; Morrell said at a Pentagon press briefing Thursday. &quot;It's just impossible to know.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The idea for a transfer of security in 4 years was first brought up by Afghan President Hamid Karzai earlier this year. The Obama administration quietly embraced the new timeline when the Secretary of Defense,<span style="background-position: 100% 50%; color: #0000f6; cursor: pointer; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foxnews.com/topics/politics/obama-administration/robert-gates.htm#r_src=ramp" rel="nofollow">Robert Gates</a></span>, and Joint Chiefs Chairman, Adm. Mike Mullen, told reporters during an off camera briefing in Melbourne, Australia they were comfortable with the plan just over a week ago.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The new date is seen by many as a careful shift of focus away from the July 2011 date that President Obama said earlier this year would mark the beginning of a U.S. troop withdrawal.

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Operations in Afghanistan are unsustainable, skyrocket deficits, maximize casualties, overstretch the military and will collapse heg – plan key to solve</span></strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">First, large-scale territorial wars and long-term occupations have proven counter-productive and unsustainable. The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan have made manifest the lesson that should have been learned from the Soviet experience in Afghanistan and our tragedy in Vietnam. These wars demonstrate the power paradox: credible military power is needed to deter, however if force is used unwisely, it can diminish power.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The full economic costs – direct and indirect – of such wars are enormous. Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz estimates the cost of the Iraq and Afghan wars over $4 trillion. The price in casualties and ruined lives is stunning. The long-term health care costs for soldiers' traumatic brain injuries alone are estimated to be above $1 trillion.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In a classic case of imperial over-stretch, the US maintains more than 800 military sites around the world. A central issue in Iraq today is whether the US will be allowed to keep five large permanent bases. As former US national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski observed of the Iraq war: “It is essentially a war of colonialism, attempted in a post-colonial age.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">We should remember that the long decline of the Roman Empire started during the plague-ridden reign of Marcus Aurelius. Rome became a military empire perennially enmeshed in frontier wars, desperate to recruit more soldiers and to raise taxes. The US is not Rome, but it would still be prudent to reduce our global military footprint and to practice strategic economy.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Second, recognizing emerging threats and better understanding old ones, we must upgrade systems of readiness on massive scales. This means preparing for asymmetric threats and developing systemic resilience to protect nations -- doing what 'homeland security' should be all about.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">President Ronald Reagan got one thing right about ‘Star Wars’: it would be far better to defend populations than to threaten their annihilation. Even if Reagan initially pursued missile defense in destabilizing ways, he was right, morally and practically, about focusing on civilian defense rather than mutual assured destruction. This point is even more relevant today when powerful new asymmetrical technologies make attribution and thus deterrence increasingly less assured.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Cyber threats, for example, are now getting much attention. This concern is entirely warranted, although as Seymour Hersh and Misha Glenny point out, it is important to distinguish between the real annoyance of cyber-espionage and the more murky threat of cyberwar.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">A computer hacker can harm your interests; a germ hacker will almost certainly kill you. No threat is more poorly understood than biological weapons. Before Nixon ended the US offensive bio-weapons program in 1969, the Pentagon and CIA had worked together to create tools of germ warfare with nuclear lethal equivalence. The Soviets did the same.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">These super-weapons were tested, but the public and even most national security leaders do not understand their destructiveness because the results remain highly classified and buried. Advances in biotechnology over the last 40 years have made the threat more potent, and the know-how has moved from state players to sophisticated non-state players.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">We must realize that a biological attack on Singapore, Hong Kong, Istanbul, London, or New York would have crippling international consequences for all.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Third, there is a need for new technological solutions and multilateral approaches to defense. The national model alone cannot work.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The recent security and nuclear cooperation treaties between the UK and France should serve as a model. Pooling resources will be key to affording the defense we need. But we are still fighting the last war, if not the one before that.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The recent NATO summit at Lisbon raised awareness of emergent threats. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned, &quot;NATO must have capacity to anticipate and protect against shifting security challenges from terrorism to ballistic missiles, from cyber attacks to the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Relying on strategies of the past will not suffice.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">For example, a meaningful civilian defense against biological weapons is possible, but it will require vast reserves of medical countermeasures for all threatened nations. To overcome the orphan drug problem, a global vaccines and therapeutics program must pioneer ways for participants to share development costs, stockpiles and intellectual property rights.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Today’s budget pressures will mean axing some defense sacred cows, as the UK has begun to do, however it is up to the policy hawks to ensure that cuts serve the interests of a strategic rethink. We can achieve more security with less Cold War-style defense spending.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">If our leaders do not define a new security paradigm, the accountants will unilaterally disarm or the generals will keep fighting old wars while new threats deepen. We must adapt to new realities, lest we go the way of old empires.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Q1: General McChrystal is expected to request up to 40,000 additional troops and recommend a greater focus on counterinsurgency operations. Is this approach likely to succeed in strengthening the Afghan state, defeating the Taliban, and advancing America’s fight against terrorism? </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">A1: Probably not<span class="BoldUnderline">. <span style="background-color: lime;">Counterinsurgency doctrine</span></span>, or COIN, has captured the hearts and minds of many in the D.C. policy community. Upon close inspection, however, it becomes clear that COIN, at least <span class="BoldUnderline">as applied to Afghanistan, <span style="background-color: lime;">is built on</span> a number of <span style="background-color: lime;">shaky assumptions. Consider:</span> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in; text-indent: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">1. </span><span style="background-color: lime;">Even if</span></span> General <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">McChrystal gets all 40,000</span> troops</span> he has requested, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">the combined</span></span> International Security Assistance Force <span class="BoldUnderline">(ISAF),</span> Operation Enduring Freedom <span class="BoldUnderline">(OEF), and Afghan <span style="background-color: lime;">contingent would still number </span>less than 250,000<span style="background-color: lime;">—far fewer than the 670,000</span> troops <span style="background-color: lime;">the U.S.</span> Army’s own Counterinsurgency <span style="background-color: lime;">Field Manual suggests is necessary</span> to secure a state of Afghanistan’s size. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">2. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Widespread corruption</span> in the</span> August 20 <span class="BoldUnderline">election <span style="background-color: lime;">has widened the trust gap between</span> the <span style="background-color: lime;">Karzai</span> government <span style="background-color: lime;">and the Afghan people</span>. Because successful <span style="background-color: lime;">counterinsurgency requires a government that is credible and responsive</span> to its citizens, these developments threaten to derail the U.S.</span> and NATO <span class="BoldUnderline">mission</span>. And as our experience in South Vietnam made painfully clear, the White House is usually powerless to force any host nation to enact good-government reforms. </span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in; text-indent: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">3. </span></span>General <span class="BoldUnderline">McChrystal’s strategic review emphasizes “population protection” as the key to drying up support for the Taliban. The claim is based on the assumption that insurgencies require the backing</span>, or at least acquiescence, <span class="BoldUnderline">of surrounding communities</span> in order to function. <span class="BoldUnderline">But</span> a recent article in the <em>Washington Post</em> noted that <span class="BoldUnderline">the Taliban rely primarily on foreign, rather than local, funding sources, a fact that suggests that population protection may ultimately do little to diminish the insurgency’s strength. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">4. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Public support for a counterinsurgency</span> campaign of such massive proportions <span style="background-color: lime;">simply does not exist</span></span><span class="Underline">.</span> Recent polls suggest that over 50 percent of Americans are against sending more troops to Afghanistan. And our European allies are even less enthusiastic about escalating the war. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Finally, the COIN framework is built on the larger assumption that eliminating the Taliban and stabilizing Afghanistan is the best use of American resources in the broader effort to combat terrorism. Al Qaeda’s presence in a pre-9/11, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan has convinced many officials that a Taliban takeover would result in al Qaeda’s inevitable return to the state. But al Qaeda already has established itself in Pakistan’s semi-governed spaces. Along with Taliban and other extremist militants, the group enjoys the relative safety of these territories, where Pakistani sovereignty precludes any substantive U.S. ground force. Even if al Qaeda were to reenter Afghanistan sometime in the future, the United States would face the same basic terrorist threats that it does today. Critics will argue that Afghanistan served as a base and planning center for 9/11. True enough; but al Qaeda, in establishing a presence in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen has already developed numerous “safe havens.”</span> In short, <span class="BoldUnderline">our overwhelming focus on Afghanistan fails to serve a more nuanced counterterrorism strategy that acknowledges the many other areas in which al Qaeda operates</span>. Q2: So how should the United States approach the war? </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">A2: We need to reframe our thinking about U.S. goals and the means to achieve them. As outlined above, COIN in Afghanistan is only tenuously linked to counterterrorism, the original purpose of our efforts. <span class="BoldUnderline">The Obama administration should implement <span style="background-color: lime;">a more minimalist policy</span> in the region, one <span style="background-color: lime;">that employs special operations</span> forces and airstrikes <span style="background-color: lime;">to directly target terrorists</span>, especially leaders of cells.</span> </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Critics charge that these operations are mere tactical successes, detached from any larger strategy. This is a disingenuous assessment. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Targeted strikes</span> do, in fact, serve the greater strategic purpose of <span style="background-color: lime;">disrupt</span>ing the planning and execution of <span style="background-color: lime;">terrorist attacks</span>. Unlike COIN—which seems to harbor the grandiose notion of eliminating terrorism by transforming societies</span><span class="Underline">,</span> regardless of cost—<span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">counterterrorism acknowledges that radicalism will always exist and</span> that <span style="background-color: lime;">policymakers should</span> directly <span style="background-color: lime;">seek to contain it.</span> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">At the core of this shift is an acknowledgment that our best Afghanistan policy is no better than our best Pakistan policy. ISAF and Afghan forces can do everything imaginable to eliminate Taliban influence in the country, but any effort that does not address the presence of militants in Pakistan’s semi-governed spaces ultimately does little to reduce the threat posed by al Qaeda. At a most basic level, the Obama administration must change the calculus of the Pakistani military and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) with regard to extremists in the country’s northwest. Doing so will force the United States to play a central role in rapprochement between Pakistan and India—and be a fair broker to both parties. What about Afghanistan? Proponents of an “all-in” approach tend to misrepresent a minimalist strategy as complete withdrawal, arguing that the United States abandoned Afghanistan after the Soviet war and that doing so again would plunge the country into anarchy. But few serious analysts are talking about abandoning Afghanistan, and there is no reason to believe that a smaller, more specialized force would not be able to confront any resumption of al Qaeda activity in the country</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">As far as the Taliban are concerned, there is reason to believe that an ever-larger foreign troop presence simply swells the movement’s ranks</span> (to wit<span class="BoldUnderline">: it has been dismaying to watch increased troop levels correlate with recent Taliban gains).</span> Until the administration can convincingly demonstrate how additional troops will, in fact, support broader national security and counterterrorism goals, the United States is better served by a strategy that minimizes the loss of life and dizzying levels of expenditure that any “all-in” approach would entail. </span><br />

<strong>It’s unwinnable – large footprints drive the Pashtuns to the Taliban</strong><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><strong><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fuller, 9</span></span></strong> – CIA officer for 25 years, former CIA station chief in Kabul and a former vice-chair of the CIA's National Intelligence Council (Graham, Christian Science Monitor, 12/2, &quot;Obama speech: kicking the can down the road in Afghanistan&quot;, lexis) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">The &quot;objective&quot; situation in <span class="BoldUnderline">Afghanistan remains a mess. </span>The details are well known. <span class="BoldUnderline">Senior commanders acknowledge that <span style="background-color: lime;">we are not</span> now <span style="background-color: lime;">winning hearts and minds</span> in Afghanistan; indeed, <span style="background-color: lime;">we never can,</span> and certainly not at gunpoint. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Most <span style="background-color: lime;">Pashtuns will never accept a US plan</span> for Afghanistan's future. <span style="background-color: lime;">The non-Pashtuns</span></span> - Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, etc. <span class="BoldUnderline">- naturally <span style="background-color: lime;">welcome any outside support in</span> what is <span style="background-color: lime;">a</span> virtual <span style="background-color: lime;">civil war.</span> America has inadvertently ended up choosing sides. <span style="background-color: lime;">US forces are perceived</span> by large numbers of Afghans <span style="background-color: lime;">as an occupying army inflicting</span> large <span style="background-color: lime;">civilian casualties</span></span>. The struggle has now leaked into Pakistan - with even higher stakes. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Obama's policies would seem an unsatisfying compromise among contending arguments. <span class="BoldUnderline">Thirty thousand <span style="background-color: lime;">more troops</span> will not turn the tide; arguably they present more American targets for attack. They <span style="background-color: lime;">will heighten</span> traditional <span style="background-color: lime;">xenophobia against foreigners</span> traipsing through Pashtun villages and homes. <span style="background-color: lime;">It is a fool's errand to persuade the locals in Pashtun territory that the Taliban are the enemy and the US is their friend</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Whatever mixed feelings Pashtuns have toward the Taliban, <span class="BoldUnderline">they know the Taliban remain the single most important element of Pashtun political life; the Taliban will be among them long after Washington tires of this mission</span><span class="Underline">. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">The strategy of the Bush era envisioned Afghanistan as a vital imperial outpost in a post-Soviet dream world where hundreds of overseas US bases would cement US global hegemony, keeping Russia and China in check and the US on top. That world vision is gone - except to a few Washington diehards who haven't grasped the new emerging global architectures of power, economics, prestige, and influence. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The Taliban will inevitably figure significantly in the governance of almost any future Afghanistan, like it or not. Future <span style="background-color: lime;">Taliban leaders, once rid of foreign occupation, will have little incentive to support global jihadi schemes - they never</span> really <span style="background-color: lime;">have by choice.</span> The Taliban inherited bin Laden as a poison pill from the past when they came to power in 1996 and have learned a bitter lesson about what it means to lend state support to a prominent terrorist group. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">The Taliban with a voice in power will have every incentive to welcome foreign money and expertise into the country, including the Pashtun regions - as long as it is not part of a Western strategic package. An austere Islamic regime is not the ideal outcome for Afghanistan, but it is by far the most realistic. To reverse ground realities and achieve a markedly different outcome is not in the cards and will pose the same dilemma to Obama next year. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Meanwhile<span class="BoldUnderline">, Pakistan will never be willing or able to solve Washington's Afghanistan dilemma. Pakistan's own stability has been brought to the very brink by US demands that it solve America's self-created problem in Afghanistan. Pakistan will eventually be forced to resolve Afghanistan itself - but only after the US has gone,</span> and only by making a pact with Taliban forces both inside Afghanistan and in Pakistan itself. Washington will not accept that for now, but it will ultimately be forced to fairly soon. Maybe the Pakistanis can root out bin Laden, but meanwhile, Al Qaeda has extended its autonomous franchises around the world, and terrorists can train and plan almost anywhere in the world; they do not need Afghanistan. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">By now, as in so many other elements of the Global War on Terror, <span class="BoldUnderline">the US has become more part of the problem than part of the solution. We are sending troops to defend troops that themselves constitute an affront to Afghan nationalism. <span style="background-color: lime;">Only</span> expeditious <span style="background-color: lime;">American withdrawal</span> from Afghanistan <span style="background-color: lime;">will prevent exacerbation of the problem. </span></span></span><br />

<strong>Taliban can recruit faster than we kill—large footprint with an illegitimate government ensures this</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Are the basic premises of our current policy in Afghanistan fatally flawed? </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">The fact that I feel compelled to pose <span class="BoldUnderline">this question</span> so soon after the completion of President Obama’s painstaking review <span class="BoldUnderline">reflects the mounting evidence that the results of that policy have fallen far short of expectations. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Let’s begin at the beginning, with Marja. The holy trinity of modern counterinsurgency is clear, hold, and build. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Coalition forces are stalled</span></span> at step one. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">After the </span>initial <span style="background-color: lime;">military thrust, </span>many <span style="background-color: lime;">Taliban fighters</span></span>, including mid-level commanders<span class="BoldUnderline">, <span style="background-color: lime;">swooped back in</span> to the area to intimidate local inhabitants </span>who might otherwise be inclined to cooperate with the coalition and Afghan government. <span class="BoldUnderline">Many other <span style="background-color: lime;">Afghanis sympathize with the</span> core <span style="background-color: lime;">Taliban message that we intend to occupy their country</span> for the long-term <span style="background-color: lime;">with the aim of imposing alien</span> cultural, religious, and political <span style="background-color: lime;">values</span>. It is hard to see what will tip this stalemate in our favor,</span> even harder to see how we can hand over governance and security function to the Afghans in Marja any time soon. Brigadier General Frederick Hodges, one of the leading commanders in southern Afghanistan, puts it this way: “You’ve got to have the governance part ready to go. We talked about doing that in Marja but didn’t realize how hard it was to do. <span class="BoldUnderline">Ultimately, it’s up to the Afghans to step forward.” It’s clear that Hodges is not holding his breath. The</span> next shoe to drop was <span class="BoldUnderline">Kandahar</span><span class="Underline">.</span> Ever since this Taliban stronghold was identified as a key target, the tension between the U.S. and Afghan governments on this issue has been palpable—so much so that the coalition is now hesitant to call what it has in mind an “offensive.” Just last week, we learned that the <span class="BoldUnderline">operation scheduled to begin in the spring would fall even farther behind schedule</span>. As The New York Times reports, “<span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">The Afghan government has not produced the </span>civilian leadership and trained security <span style="background-color: lime;">forces it was to contribute</span> to the effort</span>, U.S. officials said, and <span class="BoldUnderline">the support from Kandaharis that the United States was counting on Karzai to deliver has not materialized</span>.” Stanley <u>McChrystal</u>, the top commander in Afghanistan, <span class="BoldUnderline">has been admirably frank about a core difficulty: the residents of Kandahar are far from sure that they want the protection we claim to be offering them</span><u>.</u> </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">On to Kabul, where President <span class="BoldUnderline">Karzai has reportedly lost faith in the coalition’s ability (and that of his own government) to defeat the Taliban and is secretly maneuvering to strike a separate deal with them</span><u>.</u> If these reports are correct—and Susan Rice, our UN ambassador, disputed them on Sunday (though, notably, she offered no new evidence in support of her assertion that Karzai remains a committed partner)—two events appear to be fueling his growing disenchantment: senior American officials’ claims that his reelection lacked legitimacy, and President Obama’s December announcement that he intended to begin reducing the number of American troops by July 2011. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">One might be tempted to chalk up the extent of our difficulties in Afghanistan to tendentious reporting. I was skeptical myself—that is, until I stumbled across a stunning NATO/ISAF report completed in March. This report summarizes the results of an in-depth survey conducted in nine of the 16 districts in Kandahar Province to which researchers could safely gain access. Here are some of the findings: </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Security is viewed everywhere as a major problem. When asked to name the top dangers experienced while traveling on the roads, far more respondents named Afghan National Army and Police checkpoints than roadside bombs, Taliban checkpoints, or criminals. And the Taliban were rated better than ISAF convoys and checkpoints as well</span><u>.</u> </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">Corruption is viewed as a widespread problem and is experienced by respondents on a regular basis. In fact, 84 percent say that corruption is the main reason for the current conflict. <span style="background-color: lime;">Corruption erodes confidence in the Afghan government</span>, and fully two-thirds of respondents believe that this corruption forces them to seek alternatives to government services and authority. Chillingly, <span style="background-color: lime;">53 percent regard the Taliban as “incorruptible.”</span> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">The <span class="BoldUnderline">residents</span> of Kandahar <span class="BoldUnderline">overwhelmingly prefer a process of reconciliation to the prospect of continued conflict. <span style="background-color: lime;">Ninety-four percent say that it is better to negotiate with the Taliban</span> than to fight with them</span><u>,</u> and they see grounds for believing that these negotiations will succeed. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Eighty-five percent regard the Taliban as “our Afghan brothers</span></span>” (a phrase President Karzai repeated word for word in his address to the recent jirga), and 81 percent say that the Taliban would lay down their arms if given jobs. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Our military commanders in Afghanistan talk incessantly about the need to “shape” the political context in a given area before beginning activities with a significant military component—but if their own research is correct, our chances of “shaping” Kandahar any time soon range from slim to none. Based on General McChrystal’s own logic, then, we cannot proceed there because a key requirement for success is not fulfilled. And if we can’t prevail in Kandahar, <span class="BoldUnderline">then <span style="background-color: lime;">we’re stuck with the Taliban as a long-term</span> military presence and <span style="background-color: lime;">political force</span> in Afghanistan. </span></span><br />

Former BBC correspondent George Arney reported on September 18, 2001, that Niaz Naik, the former Pakistani foreign secretary, had told him that he was informed by US officials at a UN-sponsored international contact group on Afghanistan in Berlin during July that year that unless Osama bin Laden were handed over swiftly, America would take military action to kill or capture both Bin Laden and Mullah Omar. The wider objective, however, was to topple the Taliban regime and install a transitional government under King Mohammad Zahir Shah. The invasion was to take place in mid-October 2001. Mr. Naik went on to say that he doubted that the US would have abandoned its plan to invade Afghanistan even if Osama were handed over by the Taliban. Arney's story is corroborated by the Guardian correspondent David Leigh in his report published on September 26, 2001, in which he revealed that the Taliban had received specific warning by the US through secret diplomacy in Berlin in July that the Bush Administration would topple the entire regime militarily unless Osama is extradited to the US. This was part of the larger design of US military, industrial complex to bring about regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. As the US needed bases in Pakistan to accomplish its pre-planned invasion of Afghanistan, the Bush Administration sought to use Islamabad as a cat's paw to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. Fortunately for President Bush, a usurper ruled there, devoid of all legitimacy, legal and moral, and he readily and willingly succumbed to US pressure and made a U-turn by severing all links with the Taliban. He even joined the war against Afghanistan instead of using his leverage with the Taliban to exhaust all means of peaceful settlement of the dispute. The entire region, including Pakistan, was declared a war zone by the US military command, and the flights of all passenger planes were prohibited over a certain altitude, while no merchant ships could enter the harbors of Pakistan, thus bringing maritime trade (which comprises approximately 95 percent of Pakistan's import-export trade) to a standstill. <span class="BoldUnderline">It is no wonder that <span style="background-color: lime;">Pakistan suffered a loss of 34 billion</span> dollars <span style="background-color: lime;">because o</span>f its involvement in <span style="background-color: lime;">the Afghan war</span>.</span> America's War As one can see<span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">, it was America's</span> war <span style="background-color: lime;">that was imposed upon Pakistan</span></span>. Whether Pakistan could have avoided the war is a matter of controversy among politicians and political observers. But <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">the war has fuelled insurgency in Pakistan's</span> hitherto peaceful <span style="background-color: lime;">tribal territory</span> adjacent to Afghanistan. This insurgency shows no sign of abatement</span>, as terrorist attacks on military and civilian centers in the capital and major cities of the North-West Frontier Province and Punjab continue with a vengeance, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">posing threat to the security of the state.</span></span> In the meantime, routine predator strikes by the US in Waziristan have taken a heavy toll of civilian lives amid accusations of Islamabad's complicity in the piratical attacks on tribespeople, which prompts them to resort to retaliatory strikes on the perpetrators. Not satisfied with Pakistan's military operations in the tribal region, the US Administration has compelled Islamabad's fragile government to pull out its troops from the tense Indo-Pak border and deploy them in the restive tribal belt along the Pak-Afghan border. Now <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Pakistan faces existential threat from the Taliban</span></span> <span style="background-color: yellow;">a</span>nd not India, a perception <span class="BoldUnderline">which the country's military leadership is not prepared to share, </span>given the unresolved disputes with New Delhi, which triggered four wars during the last 62 years. At the same time, speculation (not entirely unfounded) is rife about the involvement of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the former Blackwater (now christened Xe Services) in murder, mayhem, and gunrunning as evidenced by the armed Americans who drive consulate vehicles through cities and, when intercepted, refuse to disclose their identity. It is here that one recalls with dismay the role of General Stanley McChrystal, who until last year headed the Joint Special Operations Command, which runs drone attacks and targeted assassinations with the assistance of the operatives of the former Blackwater. This was revealed by Jeremy Scahill's investigative report published in the US weekly the Nation. That may, perhaps, solve the mystery surrounding a series of assassinations of ulama belonging to various Islamic movements. The sinister motive behind such acts of terror is to incite sectarian violence in Pakistan and lay the blame at the doors of religious extremists. Similar death squads were organized by the CIA in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to carry out political assassinations of nationalists who were opposed to US intervention. At the time, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua complained to the International Court of Justice about the mining of Nicaraguan ports, the violation of the country's airspace, the killing and kidnapping of individuals on the Nicaraguan territory, and the threat or use of force by the US. The court in its decision in June 1986 held that the US was in breach of the customary rules of international law and international humanitarian law. The above case is titled the &quot;Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua.&quot; The precedent set by this case may be invoked by Pakistan to prevent the US drone attacks on its territory. Once the piratical attacks of the US have stopped, the irritant in the tribal insurgency would have gone, paving the way for pacification of the conflict. If this were Pakistan's war, the government would have exercised its own judgment in dealing with the militants at home, either by conciliation or by resort to force. But Islamabad's so-called operation against militants is subordinated to US military designs in the region, aimed at the encirclement of the People's Republic of China and the control of the transit of gas pipelines from Central Asia to South Asia. It is not aimless that China expressed its concern over the concentration of US, NATO troops in the region. India fits in the American scheme of things, hence the US-India nuclear deal. Pakistan's National Interest <span class="BoldUnderline">In this emerging security environment, Pakistan will have to be content with its role as a junior partner of India. Therefore, the sooner Islamabad extricates itself from the US &quot;war on terror,&quot; the better it is for its security and independence.</span> Doesn't Islamabad realize that its military operation against the militants would leave its border with India vulnerable to a New Delhi offensive? If Pakistan permits the US to attack the suspected training centers of militants on its territory, will it be able to prevent India from doing so? With Islamabad embroiled in internecine strife, it cannot negotiate with India from a position of strength. It may be forced to make a compromise that might be detrimental to its national interest. <span class="BoldUnderline">Pakistan's preoccupation with tribal rebellion would not permit it to deal with separatist ethnic forces in Baluchistan. Undoubtedly, this is a threat to the territorial integrity of Pakistan.</span> After the total failure of the military operation in Baluchistan, the federal government has come round to the painful conclusion that political and not military action can bring militancy to an end. Granting general amnesty to the dissidents and engaging them in a meaningful dialogue on contentious issues is a laudable initiative. The same gesture should be made to the militants in the tribal areas. But Islamabad has adopted double standards in dealing with the Baluchistan militants and the Pashtun militants, as if there were good militants and bad ones. This discriminatory policy would intensify the Pashtun insurgency and might drive them toward even more escalation. The rulers have seen the consequences of military operations in the former East Pakistan, Baluchistan, Karachi, Sind, and FATA (federally administered tribal areas). If anything, <span class="BoldUnderline">the situation has only worsened. The surge of US troops, <span style="background-color: lime;">the expansion of war</span> beyond the borders of Afghanistan, and the attacks on Quetta and Muridke as envisaged by Obama's new strategy <span style="background-color: lime;">would mean that US troops are at war with the people of Pakistan</span></span><u><span style="background-color: lime;">.</span></u> Any Solution? <span class="BoldUnderline">The <span style="background-color: lime;">Obama</span> Administration <span style="background-color: lime;">would be better advised to concentrate on its exit strategy,</span> </span>and to that end, it is imperative that it involve the UN in its peace-making efforts aimed at the establishment of a broad-based government in Afghanistan, because the Karzai Government has no legitimacy. To fill the vacuum, the UN peacekeeping force, made up of troops of states not involved in the Afghan war, may be deployed until a government of national unity is able to assume full responsibility. Here the US can contribute to the postwar reconstruction of Afghanistan under the aegis of the UN. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">The insurgency</span> in the tribal region <span style="background-color: lime;">is the spillover effect of US military occupation</span> of Afghanistan, <span style="background-color: lime;">but Pakistan faces </span>a far greater threat: <span style="background-color: lime;">the threat of ethnic violence</span> as manifested <span style="background-color: lime;">in</span> the <span style="background-color: lime;">bloody clashes among various</span> linguistic <span style="background-color: lime;">groups</span> in urban and rural Sind. <span style="background-color: lime;">These have been overshadowed by the counterinsurgency operations</span> in FATA, <span style="background-color: lime;">but they may erupt at any moment</span>, thus <span style="background-color: lime;">destabilizing the state</span></span><u><span style="background-color: lime;">.</span></u> </span></strong><br />

Residents of the region where the attack took place are fleeing in terror as gunfire rings out around them, and government forces have been unable to quell the violence. Two regional government officials were beheaded by militants in retaliation for the killing of other militants by government forces. As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where we have come to expect such terrible events. This, unfortunately, is a whole new ballgame. It is part of another conflict that is brewing, one which puts what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in deep shade, and which represents a grave and growing threat to us all<span class="BoldUnderline">. <span style="background-color: lime;">Pakistan is now</span> trembling <span style="background-color: lime;">on the edge of</span> violent <span style="background-color: lime;">chaos</span></span>, and is doing so <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">with nuclear weapons</span></span> in its hip pocket, <span class="BoldUnderline">right <span style="background-color: lime;">in the middle of</span> one of <span style="background-color: lime;">the most dangerous neighborhood</span>s <span style="background-color: lime;">in the world</span></span><u><span style="background-color: lime;">.</span></u> The situation in brief: Pakistan for years has been a nation in turmoil, run by a shaky government supported by a corrupted system, dominated by a blatantly criminal security service, and threatened by a large fundamentalist Islamic population with deep ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan. All this is piled atop an ongoing standoff with neighboring India that has been the center of political gravity in the region for more than half a century. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">The fact that Pakistan</span>, and <span style="background-color: lime;">India</span>, and <span style="background-color: lime;">Russia, and China all possess nuclear weapons </span>and share the same space <span style="background-color: lime;">means any</span> ongoing or <span style="background-color: lime;">escalating violence</span> over there <span style="background-color: lime;">has the real potential to crack open the</span> very <span style="background-color: lime;">gates of Hell</span> itself. Recently, <span style="background-color: lime;">the Taliban made a military push</span> into the northwest Pakistani region around the Swat Valley</span><u>.</u> According to a recent Reuters report<u>:</u> The (Pakistani) army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control. But insecurity mounted after a civilian government came to power last year and tried to reach a negotiated settlement. A peace accord fell apart in May 2008. After that, hundreds — including soldiers, militants and civilians — died in battles. Militants unleashed a reign of terror, killing and beheading politicians, singers, soldiers and opponents. They banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls' schools. About 1,200 people were killed since late 2007 and 250,000 to 500,000 fled, leaving the militants in virtual control. Pakistan offered on February 16 to introduce Islamic law in the Swat valley and neighboring areas in a bid to take the steam out of the insurgency. The militants announced an indefinite cease-fire after the army said it was halting operations in the region. President Asif Ali Zardari signed a regulation imposing sharia in the area last month. But the Taliban refused to give up their guns and pushed into Buner and another district adjacent to Swat, intent on spreading their rule. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">The U</span>nited <span style="background-color: lime;">S</span>tates, already embroiled in a war against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, <span style="background-color: lime;">must now face the possibility that Pakistan could collapse</span> under the mounting threat of Taliban forces there</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Military and diplomatic advisers to President Obama, uncertain how best to proceed, now face one of the great nightmare scenarios of our time. &quot;Recent militant gains in Pakistan,&quot; reported The New York Times on Monday, &quot;have so alarmed the White House that the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the situation as 'one of the very most serious problems we face.'&quot; <u>&quot;</u>Security was deteriorating rapidly,&quot; reported The Washington Post on Monday, &quot;particularly in the mountains along the Afghan border that harbor al-Qaeda and the Taliban, intelligence chiefs reported, and there were signs that those groups were working with indigenous extremists in Pakistan's populous Punjabi heartland. The Pakistani government was mired in political bickering. The army, still fixated on its historical adversary India, remained ill-equipped and unwilling to throw its full weight into the counterinsurgency fight. But despite the threat the intelligence conveyed, Obama has only limited options for dealing with it. Anti-American feeling in Pakistan is high, and a U.S. combat presence is prohibited. The United States is fighting Pakistan-based extremists by proxy, through an army over which it has little control, in alliance with a government in which it has little confidence.&quot; It is believed</span> <span class="BoldUnderline">Pakistan is currently in possession of between 60 and 100 nuclear weapons.</span> Because Pakistan's stability is threatened by the wide swath of its population that shares ethnic, cultural and religious connections to the fundamentalist Islamic populace of Afghanistan, fears over what could happen to those nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government collapses are very real. <span class="BoldUnderline">&quot;<span style="background-color: lime;">As the insurgency</span> of the Taliban and Al Qaeda <span style="background-color: lime;">spreads</span> in Pakistan,&quot; reported the Times last week, &quot;senior American <span style="background-color: lime;">officials</span> say they <span style="background-color: lime;">are increasingly concerned about</span> new <span style="background-color: lime;">vulnerabilities for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, including the potential for militants to snatch a weapon</span> in transport or to insert sympathizers into laboratories or fuel-production facilities</span><u>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In public, the administration has only hinted at those concerns, repeating the formulation that the Bush administration used: that it has faith in the Pakistani Army. But that cooperation, according to officials who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity surrounding the exchanges between Washington and Islamabad, has been sharply limited when the subject has turned to the vulnerabilities in the Pakistani nuclear infrastructure.&quot; &quot;The prospect of turmoil in Pakistan sends shivers up the spines of those U.S. officials charged with keeping tabs on foreign nuclear weapons,&quot; reported Time Magazine last month. &quot;Pakistan is thought to possess about 100 — the U.S. isn't sure of the total, and may not know where all of them are. Still, if Pakistan collapses, the U.S. military is primed to enter the country and secure as many of those weapons as it can, according to U.S. officials. Pakistani officials insist their personnel safeguards are stringent, but a sleeper cell could cause big trouble, U.S. officials say.&quot; In other words, a shaky Pakistan spells trouble for everyone, especially if America loses the footrace to secure those weapons in the event of the worst-case scenario</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">If</span> Pakistani <span style="background-color: lime;">militants ever succeed</span> in toppling the government,</span> several very dangerous events could happen at once. Nuclear-armed <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">India could be galvanized</span> into military action</span> of some kind, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">as could</span></span> nuclear-armed <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">China or</span></span> nuclear-armed <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Russia</span></span><u><span style="background-color: lime;">.</span></u> If the Pakistani government does fall, and all those Pakistani nukes are not immediately accounted for and secured, the specter (or reality) of <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">loose nukes falling into the hands of terrorist organizations could place the entire world on a collision course with unimaginable disaster</span>.</span> We have all been paying a great deal of attention to Iraq and Afghanistan, and rightly so. The developing situation in Pakistan, however, needs to be placed immediately on the front burner. The Obama administration appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all. </span></strong><br />

Large COIN footprint collapses Pakistan, causes Indo-Pak proxy war in Afghanistan<br />
<span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lieven 12/20</span></span> <strong>(Anatol, Middle East Online, “How the Afghan Counterinsurgency Threatens Pakistan,”<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=43127" rel="nofollow">http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=43127</a></span> 12/20/2010) <span style="margin-left: 0in;"> By now, almost <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">all</span> the likely outcomes <span style="background-color: lime;">of US strategy in Afghanistan are bad ones</span></span>. They range <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">from unending civil war</span>, with government forces barely managing to hold their own against the Taliban, <span style="background-color: lime;">to de facto partition of the country</span></span>. There is a chance that the Taliban would accept a settlement involving a timetable for the complete withdrawal of US forces and a neutral central government of respected Muslim figures, together with de facto Taliban control of the Pashtun heartland in the south and Western economic aid. In return they would have to promise to exclude Al Qaeda and crack down on opium cultivation in their areas (as they did in 2000). Given that <span class="BoldUnderline">most</span> ordinary <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Taliban fighters</span></span> -- as expressed in a survey organized by Graeme Smith of the Toronto Globe and Mail -- <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">want the exit of Western troops and a Muslim</span></span> (but not necessarily Taliban) <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">government</span></span>, it's likely that<span class="BoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: lime;">the rejection of such terms</span> by the Taliban leadership would <span style="background-color: lime;">undermine</span> their <span style="background-color: lime;">support</span> on the ground</span>. This solution would, however, be heavily dependent on the help of Pakistan as a mediator and as one of the regional guarantors of the subsequent settlement. The top leadership of the Afghan Taliban is based in Pakistani Baluchistan under the protection of Pakistani military intelligence, and <span class="BoldUnderline">Pakistan has prevented the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">from launching drone attacks on them there</span> (in contrast with the intensive campaign against targets in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas to the north). <span class="BoldUnderline">Taliban forces use Pakistani territory for rest and recuperation, with the support of the local Pashtun population</span>. Pakistan also has close ties to the two other Afghan Pashtun Islamist forces allied to the Taliban, the Hizb-e-Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and the Haqqani network in the Afghan region of Greater Paktika. All of this gives Pakistan considerable influence over the Afghan Taliban -- though it must be stressed that this influence is also limited. Any settlement brokered by Pakistan would have to be one the Taliban could accept without humiliation. But <span class="BoldUnderline">if Pakistan is vital to a settlement, <span style="background-color: lime;">Pakistan is</span> also <span style="background-color: lime;">vital in itself</span></span>. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that <span class="BoldUnderline">the survival of Pakistan, not Afghanistan, is the most important issue for Western and global security in that region</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">With <span style="background-color: lime;">six times</span></span><span style="background-color: lime;"> <span class="BoldUnderline">Afghanistan's population</span></span><span class="BoldUnderline">, plus <span style="background-color: lime;">nuclear weapons</span>, <span style="background-color: lime;">a highly trained</span> 500,000-man <span style="background-color: lime;">army and a huge diaspora</span></span> (especially in Britain), <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Pakistan would increase the international terrorist threat by orders of magnitude if it collapsed</span>. There is a widespread</span> (though exaggerated) <span class="BoldUnderline">view in the West that the weakness of the Pakistani state and the strength of Islamist support makes the country's collapse a real possibility</span>. Leaving aside the danger (as exposed by WikiLeaks) of nuclear materials and skills reaching terrorist groups, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">the disintegration of the Pakistani army</span>, with its highly trained engineers and anti-aircraft forces, <span style="background-color: lime;">would</span> vastly <span style="background-color: lime;">increase the &quot;conventional&quot; terrorist threat to India</span> and the West</span>. It was therefore with horror that I recently heard that the diminished threat from Al Qaeda means that some <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Western security officials</span> are <span style="background-color: lime;">suggest</span>ing that the West can afford to put much <span style="background-color: lime;">more pressure</span> on Islamabad to attack Taliban strongholds in Pakistan's border region</span>, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">even though this may lead to greater destabilization</span> with<span style="background-color: lime;">in Pakistan</span>. This is lunatic reasoning. <span style="background-color: lime;">The diminished power of Al Qaeda should be cause for the U</span></span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">S</span></span>tates and NATO to find ways <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">to withdraw from Afghanistan</span>, not step up the fight against the Taliban</span> -- <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">since it was to fight Al Qaeda that we went there in the first place</span></span>. As for <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">the terrorist threat to the West</span></span>, this <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">has never come from the Afghan</span> Taliban</span> -- <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">but</span> it increasingly comes from the <span style="background-color: lime;">Pakistani Taliban</span> and their allies</span>, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">as</span> the</span> case of <span class="BoldUnderline">attempted <span style="background-color: lime;">Times Square</span> bomber</span> Faisal Shahzad <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">demonstrates</span></span>. Unfortunately, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">the current</span> US <span style="background-color: lime;">strategy is headed</span> in the opposite direction from using Pakistan to broker a settlement, and <span style="background-color: lime;">toward</span> an intensified fight against the Taliban and <span style="background-color: lime;">intensified pressure on Pakistan</span></span>. Even worse, <span class="BoldUnderline">there are barely the rudiments of a Plan B if that strategy fails</span>. If it proves impossible to strengthen the Afghan National Army sufficiently within the next two years, the options will be stark: <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Either US forces will have to fight on in Afghanistan indefinitely or they will have to accept the probable loss</span> of the south and east of the country and either unending civil war or de facto partition through bloody war rather than negotiated agreement</span>. Among other things, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">all these</span> options <span style="background-color: lime;">will be bad for Pakistan</span></span>, especially if <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">India is drawn into much greater support for the anti-Taliban forces</span> in Afghanistan</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">This would</span></span> in effect <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">lead to an Indo-Pakistani proxy war in Afghanistan.</span></span> </span></strong><br />

<span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Chellany, 9</span></span><strong><span class="Underline"> - professor of strategic studies at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi (9/14/09, Brahma, Japan Times, “An Advantagous U.S. Exit,” </span><span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:7094:http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20090914bc.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20090914bc.html" rel="nofollow">http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20090914bc.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:7094 --></span>) <span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">When the administration's principal war target is not the Taliban but rather al-Qaida remnants on the run, why chase a troop-intensive strategy pivoted on protecting population centers to win grassroots support? In reality, what it calls a &quot;clear, hold, build&quot; strategy is actually a &quot;surge, bribe, run&quot; strategy, except that the muddled nature of the mission and the deepening U.S. involvement crimp the &quot;run&quot; option. America's quandary is a reminder that it is easier to get into a war than to get out. In fact, Obama undermined his unfolding war strategy last March by publicly declaring, &quot;There's got to be an exit strategy.&quot; The message that sent to the Taliban and its sponsor, the Pakistani military, was that they ought to simply out-wait the Americans to reclaim Afghanistan. Before Afghanistan becomes a Vietnam-style quagmire, Obama must rethink his plan for another troop surge. Gradually <span style="background-color: lime;">drawing down U.S. troop levels</span> indeed <span style="background-color: lime;">makes more sense because what holds the</span> disparate constituents of the <span style="background-color: lime;">Taliban</span> syndicate <span style="background-color: lime;">together is a common opposition to foreign military presence. An American military exit</span> from Afghanistan will not come as a shot in the arm for the forces of global jihad, as many in Washington seem to fear. To the contrary, it <span style="background-color: lime;">will remove the common unifying element and unleash developments whose significance would be largely internal</span> or regional. In Afghanistan, <span style="background-color: lime;">a</span> vicious <span style="background-color: lime;">power struggle would break out</span> along sectarian and ethnic lines. <span style="background-color: lime;">The Taliban</span><span style="background-color: yellow;">,</span> with the active support of the Pakistani military, <span style="background-color: lime;">would certainly make a run for Kabul</span> to replay the 1996 power grab. But it won't be easy to repeat 1996. For one<span style="background-color: lime;">, the Taliban is splintered today</span>, with the tail (private armies and militias) wagging the dog. For another, the <span style="background-color: lime;">non-Taliban and non-Pashtun forces now are stronger, more organized and better prepared than in</span> 19<span style="background-color: lime;">96</span></span> to resist the Taliban's advance to Kabul, having been empowered by the autonomy they have enjoyed in provinces or by the offices they still hold in the Afghan federal government. <span class="BoldUnderline">Also, by retaining Afghan bases to carry out covert operations and Predator missions and other airstrikes, the U.S. military would be able to unleash punitive air power to prevent a 1996 repeat</span><span class="Underline">. </span>After all, it was the combination of American air power and the Northern Alliance's ground operations that ousted the Taliban from power in 2001. Against this background, the most likely outcome of the Afghan power struggle triggered by an American decision to pull out would be the formalization of the present de facto partition of Afghanistan along ethnic lines. Iraq, too, is headed in the same direction. The Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras and other ethnic minorities would be able to ensure self-governance in the Afghan areas they dominate, leaving the Pashtun lands on both sides of the British-drawn Durand Line in ferment. Thanks to ethnic polarization, the Durand Line, or the Afpak border, exists today only on maps. On the ground, it has little political, ethnic and economic relevance. As in Iraq, an American withdrawal would potentially let loose forces of Balkanization in the Afpak belt. That may sound disturbing, but this would be an unintended and perhaps unstoppable consequence of the U.S. invasion. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">An American pullout </span>actually <span style="background-color: lime;">would aid the fight against </span>international <span style="background-color: lime;">terrorism. Instead of staying bogged down in Afghanistan</span> and seeking to cajole and bribe the Pakistani military from continuing to provide succor to Islamic militants, <span style="background-color: lime;">Washington would become free to pursue a broader and more-balanced counterterrorism strategy.</span> Also, <span style="background-color: lime;">minus the Afghan-war burden, the U.S. would better appreciate the dangers to international security posed by Pakistani terror</span> groups</span> like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e- Mohammed<span class="BoldUnderline">. The threat of an Islamist takeover of Pakistan comes not from the Taliban but from these groups that have long drawn support from the Pakistani army as part of the deep-rooted military-mullah alliance. </span> </span></strong><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">An effort on that scale would garner majority US domestic support only if the public sees likely victory and Congress, the White House and the Beltway punditry line up decisively behind the policy. The emerging trends are pointing in the contrary direction. As monthly and annual US casualties in Afghanistan reached historical peaks in August 2009, and the Afghan national election loomed, a poll conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post indicated that most Americans did not support an extended US military commitment in Afghanistan.<span style="color: black;">31</span> Congressional Democrats are balking at anticipated requests for more troops.<span style="color: black;">32</span> And even conservative columnists, like the influential George F. Will, have turned against a maximalist Afghanistan policy.<span style="color: black;">33</span> Overall<span class="BoldUnderline">, increasingly strong perceptions of the Karzai government <span style="background-color: lime;">as</span> inept and <span style="background-color: lime;">corrupt are making</span> prospects that the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">could enlist it as <span style="background-color: lime;">an effective counter-insurgency</span> partner and lend it the legitimacy required to rebuild the country seem more and more <span style="background-color: lime;">baseless</span></span><span class="Underline"><span style="background-color: lime;">.</span> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">The upshot is that <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">only if the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: lime;">S</span>tates <span style="background-color: lime;">establishes a</span> well-calibrated <span style="background-color: lime;">limited policy</span> now <span style="background-color: lime;">will it have the political flexibility to sustain it over the longer-term and</span> thereby to effectively <span style="background-color: lime;">contain the jihadist threat</span> in Central Asia. If</span><span class="Underline">, </span>on the other hand, the<span class="BoldUnderline"> Obama</span> administration <span class="BoldUnderline">promises more than it can deliver in Afghanistan, a reprise of Vietnam may occur: once failure becomes clear, domestic support will evaporate, the administration will be compelled to withdraw precipitously, and the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">will lose considerable traction in the region</span>. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Congressional democrats are balking at anticipated requests for more troops </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">These factors suggest that <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">the U</span></span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">S</span></span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">should limit its</span> Afghanistan/Pakistan <span style="background-color: lime;">policy to counter-terrorism </span>and disown country-wide counterinsurgency and state-building in Afghanistan</span>. At the same time, Washington must remain highly sensitive to the dynamic whereby decreased military activity in Afghanistan combined with robust operations in Pakistan could induce al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan and render it a main threat once again.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"> In that light, <span class="BoldUnderline">any abrupt wholesale American military withdrawal from Afghanistan would be too risky. Instead, <span style="background-color: lime;">the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: lime;">S</span>tates <span style="background-color: lime;">should seek</span> to facilitate <span style="background-color: lime;">a </span>glide-path to a <span style="background-color: lime;">substantial drawdown</span> - and with it fewer casualties and lower expenditures in Afghanistan - over the next few years</span><span class="Underline">. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">Doing so would involve continuing to suppress al-Qaeda</span> in Pakistan with selective and discriminate drone strikes and denying al-Qaeda access to Afghanistan</span>. The former would require bases within Afghan territory from which to deploy airpower and special-operations forces against terrorists and terrorist infrastructure, as well as the troops and equipment to secure these bases. The latter would call for reinforced border security and force protection within Afghanistan, which in themselves would entail a surprisingly large number of soldiers. For these purposes, <span class="BoldUnderline">the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">would continue to bring extensive human intelligence and surveillance capabilities to bear on Afghanistan to detect and assess potential threats to American interests. To mitigate and eliminate such threats, the generous deployment of <span style="background-color: lime;">US special-operations forces</span> to Afghanista</span><span class="Underline">n</span> - which currently comprises some 50% of all US special-operations personnel - <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">would</span> have to <span style="background-color: lime;">be maintained</span> over the medium term.</span> Meanwhile, <span class="BoldUnderline">US train-and-equip programmes for Afghan security forces should be intensified in contemplation of a gradual and controlled hand-off of the domestic counter-terrorism mission to them when they are ready, as well as to prepare them for counterinsurgency operations, should the Afghan government wish to use them for that purpose. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">The United States should also provide strong political and economic support for the Afghan government, which is likely to remain under Karzai once the votes of the 20 August election are counted and certified. Kabul, however, should be left to take the lead in managing its relationship with the Taliban (as well as anti-narcotics policy). With US encouragement, the Karzai government should make it clear to Pashtuns in the southern and eastern parts of the country that if they support insurgents or terrorists aiming to destabilise the Afghan or Pakistani governments, they will suffer financially and militarily. Again, some US forces would be needed to give such arrangements teeth, but not at the levels required for an all-out counter-insurgency. American insurance against a militant Islamist coup or an uncontrollable level of destabilisation also should be left in place. This could entail a standby stabilisation force with tactical air capabilities based in or near Kabul, along with a robust quick-reaction force. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">That policy would reflect the reality that a deeply committed <span style="background-color: lime;">counterinsurgency</span> campaign in Afghanistan <span style="background-color: lime;">is</span> potentially <span style="background-color: lime;">counterproductive</span><span style="background-color: yellow;">,</span> probably <span style="background-color: lime;">unwinnable and</span> in any event <span style="background-color: lime;">unnecessary. The U</span>nited <span style="background-color: lime;">S</span>tates <span style="background-color: lime;">can protect its interests</span> and fulfil its international security obligations <span style="background-color: lime;">with</span> a far more circumscribed <span style="background-color: lime;">counter-terrorism effort focused on Pakistan</span></span>. Under such an approach, US policy would recognise Afghanistan as the residual problem that it has, in fact, become. </span><br />

<strong>The Plan immediately turns the population against the Taliban, solving legitimacy</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">This three-zone strategy is not, <em>per se,</em> a gamechanger, and it must be accompanied by an incremental, phased withdrawal. The withdrawal would not be a consequence of “stabilization,” but rather an essential part of the process. Since <span class="BoldUnderline">the presence of foreign troops is the most important factor in mobilizing support for the Taliban,</span> the beginning of the <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">withdrawal would change the political game</span> on two levels</span>. First<span class="BoldUnderline">, <span style="background-color: lime;">Jihad would become a motivation for fewer Afghans</span></span>; instead, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">the conflict would be</span> mostly <span style="background-color: lime;">seen as a civil war</span></span><u>.</u> Second, <span class="BoldUnderline">the pro-government population</span> (or, more exactly, the anti-Taliban one) <span class="BoldUnderline">would rally together because of fear of a Taliban victory.</span> </span><br />
<span style="color: #002561; margin-left: 0in;">Why Withdraw the Combat Troops ? Reframing the War </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">There is an argument against withdrawing combat troops: namely, that al-Qaeda would retain its sanctuary in Afghanistan because the Afghan state would not have control of some parts of the country, especially in the east. Though superficially compelling, this argument is weak for two reasons. First, the international coalition lacks the resources to control the periphery of the Afghan territory anyway. Second, <span class="BoldUnderline">the <span style="background-color: lime;">withdrawal</span> of combat troops <span style="background-color: lime;">does not preclude targeted operations</span> with the agreement of the Kabul government</span>. So, in terms of physical security, <span class="BoldUnderline">the <span style="background-color: lime;">withdrawal</span> of combat troops <span style="background-color: lime;">does not bring</span> clear <span style="background-color: lime;">gains for al-Qaeda</span>.</span> There are two important reasons for withdrawal. First, <span class="BoldUnderline">the mere presence of foreign soldiers fighting a war in Afghanistan is probably the single most important factor in the resurgence of the Taliban</span><u>.</u> The convergence of nationalism and Jihad has aided the Taliban in extending its influence. It is sometimes frightening to see how similar NATO military operations are to Soviet ones in the 1980s and how the similarities could affect the perceptions of the population. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">The majority of Afghans are </span>now deeply <span style="background-color: lime;">opposed to the foreign troops</span> on their soil. <span style="background-color: lime;">The idea that one can “stabilize” Afghanistan with more troops goes against all that one </span>should have <span style="background-color: lime;">learned from the Soviet war</span></span><strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span></u></strong> The real issue is not to “stabilize” but to create a new dynamic. The Taliban have successfully framed the war as a Jihad and a liberation war against (non-Muslim) foreign armies. The concrete consequence of this moral victory is that the movement has been able to gain ground in non-Pashtun areas. The situations in Badghris Province (northwest) and in Badakhshan Province (northeast) are extremely worrisome, because the Taliban have been able to attract the support of some Pashtun tribes and fundamentalist networks. A province like Wardak, initially opposed to the Taliban in the 1990s, is now one of its strongholds. Insecurity bred by the narcotics trade and the infighting of local groups in the north also provides the Taliban opportunities to find new allies on a more practical, rather than ideological, ground. This trend is extraordinarily dangerous, since the spread of the war geographically would put Western countries in an untenable position. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Second, <span class="BoldUnderline">withdrawal would create a new dynamic in the country, providing two main benefits. The momentum of the Taliban would slow or stop altogether, because without a foreign occupier the Jihadist and nationalist feelings of the population would be much more difficult to mobilize</span>. Furthermore<span class="BoldUnderline">, the Karzai regime would gain legitimacy</span>. If Karzai (or his successor) receives enough help from the international coalition, he would be able to develop more centralized institutions in the strategic areas or at least keep local actors under control. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">The regime would remain corrupt but would appear more legitimate if it succeeded in bringing security</span> to the population in the strategic zones <span style="background-color: lime;">without</span> the help of <span style="background-color: lime;">foreign troops</span></span><u>.</u> The support of the urban population, which opposes the Taliban, is a critical issue. <span class="BoldUnderline">Corruption is a problem primarily if it accelerates the independence of Afghanistan’s peripheral regions.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because <u>a world in which the United States exercises leadership</u> would have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world <u>would</u> have a <u>better</u> chance of <u>deal</u>ing <u>cooperatively with</u> the world's major problems, such as <u>nuclear proliferation</u>, threats of <u>regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts</u>. Finally, <u>U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the</u> United States and the <u>world to avoid another</u> global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a <u>global</u> <u>nuclear exchange</u>. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black;">Over the winter break I had an epiphany about the interrelation of U.S. hard and soft power: </span><span class="BoldUnderline">I</span><span style="color: black;"> now </span><span class="BoldUnderline">oppose a counterinsurgency</span> (COIN) <span class="BoldUnderline">strategy in Afghanistan and advocate a purely counterterror</span><span style="color: black;"> (CT) </span><span class="BoldUnderline">strategy </span><span style="color: black;">(PDF link) there instead. Blame history—or histories—that I've read recently, starting with Livy's works on early Rome (books I-V) last spring and Donald Kagan's <em>The Peloponnesian War</em> at the end of 2009. I've taken occasional dips back into Robert Kaplan's <em>Warrior Politics</em> and his source materials (Churchill, the Federalists, Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and several others). What I've taken from that reading is that </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">the U.S. must pull back</span></span><span style="color: black;"> from its current efforts to remake Iraq and Afghanistan in the image of a Western democracy, </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">or risk long-term political and economic exhaustion</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow; color: black;">.</span><span style="color: black;"> What follows is not an argument about morality, and readers may find much of it amoral. It <em>is</em> about making cold-blooded political and </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">economic calculations about where U.S. national interests will lie in the next decade. They do not lie in an open-ended COIN mission. The history of the Peloponnesian War is particularly relevant here. Athens began fighting Sparta with the resources of an empire and thousands of talents of silver in the bank—enough to fight expensive, far-flung naval and land campaigns for three years without lasting financial consequences. Athens was <em>rich</em>, and if peace with Sparta had come by the end of the third year, Athens would have continued to prosper and rule over much of the Mediterranean. (Athens had a &quot;hard&quot;—conquered or cowed—empire as opposed to the &quot;soft&quot; empire of alliances and treaties the U.S. currently has.) But the war with Sparta dragged on for decades, despite occasional peace overtures by both sides. By war's end—despite the spoils of battle and increased taxes and tribute extracted from its shrinking dominion—Athens was broke, depopulated by fighting and plague, bereft of its empire, and could no longer project power into the Mediterranean. Where its former interests ranged from Black Sea Turkey to southern Italy, it spent decades as a small-bore power and never regained its former strength or influence. I worry that the U.S. is similarly locked into an open-ended commitment to democratize a nation that is of regional rather than global importance—a parallel to Athens convincing itself that it had to conquer distant, militarily insignificant Sicily. &quot;Winning&quot; in Afghanistan </span><span class="BoldUnderline">The U.S. could &quot;win&quot; in Afghanistan</span><span style="color: black;"> where victory is defined as a stable, legitimate central government that can project power within its own borders. I don't doubt that the U.S. and its allies could accomplish this given enough time and resources. <span class="Underline">But</span> I think—as many COIN experts also do—that </span><span class="BoldUnderline">it will take at least another decade or more of blood and treasure to produce such a result, if ever</span><span style="color: black;">. Of course I'd like to see the results of a successful COIN campaign: a stable democracy, women's rights, and general prosperity for Afghans, who among all Asia's peoples surely deserve those things. I certainly want to end al-Qa'ida's ability to operate freely in South Asia and elsewhere. The U.S. is the only country that would both conceive of these missions and attempt to carry them out. But goals beyond keeping al-Qa'ida on the run don't serve the long-term interests of the U.S., and I am more interested in regaining and preserving U.S. hard power than I am in the rewards that would come from &quot;winning&quot; a lengthy COIN war. </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">I fear the U.S. people</span> and government <span style="background-color: yellow;">becoming exhausted from the costs of a lengthy COIN effort, </span>just as they are already exhausted from </span><span style="color: black;">(and have largely forgotten about) the</span><span class="BoldUnderline"> Iraq</span><span style="color: black;"> war. I worry that </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">if this fatigue sits in, the U.S. will abandon foreign-policy leadership</span></span><span style="color: black;"> as it has done periodically throughout history. </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">This outcome would be worse than a resurgent Taliban</span></span><span style="color: black;">, worse than Afghan women and men being further oppressed, </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">and</span> worse than <span style="background-color: yellow;">al-Qa'ida</span> having plentiful additional caves</span> <span style="color: black;">to plot in. Here are some signs of an exhaustion of U.S. power: </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">The U.S. is already overextended</span></span><span style="color: black;">, with commitments in Iraq (shrinking for now), </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">Afghanistan (expanding), Yemen (pending) and Iran (TBD). At home, the U.S. economy remains feeble and in the long term is increasingly hostage to other nations for goods and services it no longer produces (and increasingly, no longer <em>can</em> produce). Even more worrisome is the U.S. credit situation. The wars, and much other U.S. government spending, are now heavily underwritten by other countries' purchases of debt the U.S. issues. It has borrowed trillions from foreign countries and especially China, which continues its steady, highly rational policy of promoting exports while freeriding under the American security umbrella (just as the U.S. once rode for free beneath Britain's). Over time, those countries accrue enough debt to have a say in U.S. policies that may threaten the dollar's value, which is why you now see high U.S. officials flying to Beijing to soothe PRC nerves and explain why America keeps borrowing money. At home, there are few resources to apply following a major disaster, such as a Katrina-style hurricane or a major earthquake.</span> <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">The U.S. needs to start rebuilding its reserves—of capital,</span> of credit, <span style="background-color: yellow;">of political goodwill abroad, of military force—to be ready for</span> these and <span style="background-color: yellow;">more serious crises, for which we currently have few resources</span> to spare. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Such challenges may involve </span>humanitarian crises (think Darfur, a Rwanda-style genocide, Indian Ocean tsunamis);</span><span style="color: black;"> Latin American instability (Mexico, Venezuela, post-Castro Cuba); </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">rogue-state nuclear development</span> (Iran, North Korea); <span style="background-color: yellow;">or</span> complex <span style="background-color: yellow;">challenges from a rising power</span> (China, a reinvigorated Russia). </span></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black;">The </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">troop surge</span>,</span> however, <span class="BoldUnderline">will <span style="background-color: yellow;">not work. Afghanistan has become</span></span> Mr. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Obama's Vietnam</span> - a protracted quagmire</span> <span style="color: black;">draining precious American blood and treasure. August was the deadliest month for U.S. forces, with 47 soldiers killed by Taliban insurgents. More than 300 coalition troops have died in 2009. This is the highest toll since the war began in 2001, and there are still four months to go. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The tide of battle has turned against the West</span><span style="color: black;">. The Taliban is resurgent. It has reasserted control over its southern stronghold in Kandahar. </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">The Taliban is launching devastating attacks </span>in the western and northern parts of the country - formerly stable areas. U.S. <span style="background-color: yellow;">casualties are soaring.</span> The <span style="background-color: yellow;">morale </span>of coalition forces <span style="background-color: yellow;">is plummeting</span></span><u><span style="color: black;">.</span></u><span style="color: black;"> Most of our allies - with the exception of the Canadians and the British - are reluctant to engage the Islamist militants. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">American public support for the war is waning. </span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin-left: 0in;">The conflict has dragged on for nearly eight years. (U.S. involvement in World War II was four years, World War I less than one.) Yet, America's strategic objectives remain incoherent and elusive. </span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin-left: 0in;">The war's initial aim was to topple the Taliban and eradicate al Qaeda bases from Afghan territory. Those goals have been achieved. Washington should have declared victory and focused on the more important issue: preventing Islamic fundamentalists from seizing power in Pakistan, along with its nuclear arsenal. </span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin-left: 0in;">Instead, America is engaged in futile nation-building. Mr. Obama, like President George W. Bush before him, believes Afghanistan must be transformed by erecting a strong central government, democracy and a modern economy. Washington argues this will prevent terrorism from taking root and bring about lasting &quot;stability.&quot; </span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin-left: 0in;">Hence, following a recent reassessment of the war by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, U.S. commander in Afghanistan, the Obama administration is contemplating deploying 20,000 to 40,000 U.S. troops - on top of the 21,000 already pledged. Moreover, billions have been spent building irrigation canals, schools, hospitals and factories. Civilian advisers are being sent to encourage farmers to grow other cash crops besides opium poppies. Western aid money has been used to establish a massive Afghan army, a large police force and a swollen government bureaucracy. </span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin-left: 0in;">Gen. McChrystal said this week that the situation is &quot;serious,&quot; but not impossible. He still believes victory is within reach. His new strategy is to protect Afghan civilians from Taliban attacks. He also wants to create a lucrative jobs programs and improve local government services. The goal is to win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of the Afghan people. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says we must combat Afghanistan's &quot;culture of poverty.&quot; Call it humanitarian war through social engineering. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black;">Mr. </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Obama's policy will result in a major American defeat - </span>one<span style="background-color: yellow;"> that will signal the end of America as a superpower and expose us to the world as a paper tiger</span></span><span style="color: black;">. Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. The mighty British and Russian armies were humiliated in drawn-out guerrilla campaigns</span><span class="BoldUnderline">. The country's mountainous geography</span> <span style="color: black;">and primitive tribal culture </span><span class="BoldUnderline">are ideally suited for insurgent warfare. By sending in more troops, Washington is playing right into the Taliban's hands: We are enabling the Taliban to pick off our forces one by one as they wage a campaign of attrition. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">The Taliban blend with the </span>local<span style="background-color: yellow;"> population, making it</span> almost <span style="background-color: yellow;">impossible for U.S. forces to distinguish combatants </span>from civilians. American <span style="background-color: yellow;">counterinsurgency </span>efforts <span style="background-color: yellow;">are thus alienating</span> some of the <span style="background-color: yellow;">locals</span></span><u><span style="color: black;">. </span></u><span style="color: black;">Initially welcomed as liberators,</span><span class="BoldUnderline"> we are</span> <span style="color: black;">now </span><span class="BoldUnderline">viewed </span><span style="color: black;">in some quarters </span><span class="BoldUnderline">as occupiers</span><span style="color: black;">. Moreover, much of the West's aid money is siphoned off by greedy politicians in Kabul. </span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin-left: 0in;">President Hamid Karzai's government is corrupt, venal and ineffective. It barely controls one-third of the country. It is despised by many Afghans for its brutality and incompetence. In addition, Mr. Karzai's vice-presidential running mate is a drug trafficker. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The West's efforts to forge a cohesive national state based on federalism and economic reconstruction have failed. Warlords are increasingly asserting power in the provinces. The country is fractured along tribal and ethnic lines. The center cannot hold: <span style="background-color: yellow;">Afghanistan remains mired in anarchy, blood feuds and weak, decentralized rule.</span> </span></span><br />
<span style="color: black; margin-left: 0in;">U.S. troops should be deployed to defend U.S. national interests. Their lives should never be squandered for an experiment in liberal internationalism. In fact, such a policy is morally grotesque and strategically reckless. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black;">Mr. </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Obama should </span>quickly<span style="background-color: yellow;"> withdraw most U.S. forces</span> from Afghanistan. American <span style="background-color: yellow;">air </span>power <span style="background-color: yellow;">and small, </span>flexible <span style="background-color: yellow;">Special Forces units are more than enough to wipe out al Qaeda </span>terrorists. <span style="background-color: yellow;">The Taliban is too hated to reoccupy the country - unless our huge military</span> and economic footprint <span style="background-color: yellow;">drives numerous </span>Afghans <span style="background-color: yellow;">into the</span></span><span style="color: black;"> evil, welcoming </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">arms of extremists.</span> </span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">&quot;There's a belief that the president of the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">can pick up the red phone and order forcible entry operations'' like the 2003 invasion of Iraq</span>, said Army Maj. Gen. Dan Bolger, who commands the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana. &quot;<span class="BoldUnderline">But that takes practice, and we don't get a lot of practice</span>.'' <span class="BoldUnderline">Since 2003, the Army and Marines have focused almost exclusively on learning and conducting counterinsurgency operations, which rely heavily on language and cultural knowledge and the ability to work with local police and tribal elders.</span> But commanders have increasingly fretted that their <span class="BoldUnderline">troops have lost skills that the military used to practice all the time: fast-paced &quot;kick-in-the-door'' attacks across a border, with armor columns, intelligence and logistics support coordinated with artillery and air strikes</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">With the drawdown of troops in Iraq, the Pentagon finally is able to begin rebuilding its strategic reserve</span>, the battalions and brigades and equipment normally kept on standby for sudden crises. <span class="BoldUnderline">But the continuing demands in Afghanistan, where the Pentagon is sending 25,000 fresh troops in the coming months, leaves virtually no time for anything but Afghanistan-focused training. </span>Moreover, <span class="BoldUnderline">the</span> two <span class="BoldUnderline">wars have seriously depleted stockpiles of combat-ready vehicles, weapons, communications equipment and other gear. So, even if troops had time to practice big-war operations, they don't have the stuff to do it with. </span>&quot;<span class="BoldUnderline">At a certain point,</span>'' said a frustrated Bolger, &quot;<span class="BoldUnderline">you can't do more with less</span>.<span class="BoldUnderline">'' In the past year</span>, for instance, <span class="BoldUnderline">only one unit</span>, the 3rd Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division, <span class="BoldUnderline">was able to break from counterinsurgency to practice</span> an air assault to seize an airfield, <span class="BoldUnderline">a critical maneuver that would come at the start of a major combat operation</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">&quot;It was a new set of challenges,''</span> the division commander, Maj. Gen. James Huggins, said in an interview. <span class="BoldUnderline">Before 2001, dozens of Army and Marine Corps battalions cycled each year through the three major ground combat training centers, mastering high-intensity maneuvers with tank and armor formations, artillery, attack helicopters and fighter-bombers in grueling battles that went on day and night for weeks</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">But with</span> Iraq and <span class="BoldUnderline">Afghanistan demanding different kinds of skills, the training centers were converted into mock villages of</span> Iraqis or <span class="BoldUnderline">Afghans, where troops could practice searching cars at checkpoints, chatting with the local &quot;mayor,'' and walking foot patrols with native troops. That only one unit was able to break away from this counterinsurgency training &quot;gives you an idea of how close to the margin we are,'' said Bolger</span>. The Army training centers at Fort Polk and Fort Irwin, Calif., each have one exercise scheduled for 2011 to train troops in what the Army calls &quot;full-spectrum operations.&quot; <span class="BoldUnderline">&quot;We are trying to get back to full-spectrum operations</span>,'' Army Secretary John McHugh said in an interview. &quot;<span class="BoldUnderline">That is difficult given the high operational tempo we continue to face. ... We are rapidly deploying troops to Afghanistan and even the troops in the [reserve] pool are scheduled to go.'' </span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The Marine Corps</span> is in a similar predicament. Senior Marine officers <span class="BoldUnderline">often lament that a decade into counterinsurgency operations, the Corps has midcareer officers and non-commissioned officers who have never been on a ship, let alone learned the complex art of amphibious operations, the Marines' central mission</span>. In an attempt to correct that shortcoming, the Marine Corps just completed its first major amphibious exercise in a decade -- by simulation. An exercise involving real Marines and actual weapons and ships is planned for 2012. <span class="BoldUnderline">A shortage of equipment is as big a problem as shortage of time. A decade of combat operations has worn down tanks, Humvees, radios, aircraft engines and almost every other piece of gear</span>. The Marines think it will cost $8 billion just to fix its equipment. <span class="BoldUnderline">So much of the Corps' equipment is in Afghanistan that what it has on hand for training and any crises is &quot;seriously deficient,''</span> the then-commandant, Gen. James Conway, told Congress last spring. The bill to fix the Army's equipment may reach $36 billion, according to Gen. Peter Chiarelli, the service's vice chief of staff. The Air Force is short about $2 billion a year to fix its combat aircraft, a deficit that is building year after year and significantly shrinking the pool of planes not already committed in Afghanistan that could be sent into a come-as-you-are war. Ironically, the problem will get worse if U.S. troops and equipment begin pouring back from Afghanistan to be fixed. For instance, the Pentagon has sent 15,000 heavy-armored MRAP vehicles to Afghanistan, and an additional 10,600 are being built and rushed there to protect troops against IEDs. All those vehicles will have to be overhauled when they return, a daunting task for Mark Sheffield, a senior official at the Letterkenny Army Depot in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, where much of the work will be done. &quot;We have no history of what parts will be needed'' for these relatively new vehicles, Sheffield said in an interview. &quot;The big question is whether the supply chain will give us the parts.'' <span class="BoldUnderline">All these problems are reason for a decisive shift at the Pentagon, according to an outside bipartisan task force chartered by Congress to challenge current Defense Department planning. The group</span>, co-chaired by William Perry, who was defense secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Stephen J. Hadley, national security adviser to President George W. Bush<span class="BoldUnderline">, said</span> in a report issued earlier this year that <span class="BoldUnderline">Gates had &quot;focused too greatly on the short-term'' threats and not enough on big-war challenges. </span></span><br />

<strong>Our Counterterrorism focus creates sustainable presence and ensures consistency</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The best Afghan policy would be to reduce the number of foreign troops from the current level of 90,000 to far fewer – perhaps 20,000</span><u>.</u> In that case, two distinct objectives would remain for the international community: development and counter-terrorism. Neither would amount to the building of an Afghan state or winning a counter-insurgency campaign. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">A reduction in troop numbers</span> and a turn away from state-building <span style="background-color: yellow;">should not mean total withdrawal:</span> good projects could continue to be undertaken in electricity, water, irrigation, health, education, agriculture, rural development</span> and in other areas favoured by development agencies. <span class="BoldUnderline">Even a <span style="background-color: yellow;">light </span>US <span style="background-color: yellow;">presence </span>could continue to <span style="background-color: yellow;">allow </span>for aggressive <span style="background-color: yellow;">operations against Al Qaeda terrorists</span>, in Afghanistan</span>, <span style="font-size: 6pt;">who plan to attack the United States. The US has successfully prevent Al Qaeda from re-establishing itself since 2001 (though the result has only been to move bin Laden across the border.). The US military could also (with other forms of assistance) support the Afghan military to prevent the Taliban from seizing a city or taking over the country. </span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt; margin-left: 0in;">These twin objectives will require a very long-term presence, as indeed is almost inevitable in a country which is as poor, as fragile and traumatized as Afghanistan (and which lacks the internal capacity at the moment to become independent of Foreign aid or control its territory). But a long-term presence will in turn mean a much lighter and more limited presence (if it is to retain US domestic support). We should not control and cannot predict the future of Afghanistan. It may in the future become more violent, or find a decentralised equilibrium or a new national unity, but if its communities continue to want to work with us, we can, over 30 years, encourage the more positive trends in Afghan society and help to contain the more negative. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt; margin-left: 0in;">Such a policy can seem strained, unrealistic, counter-intuitive and unappealing. They appear to betray the hopes of Afghans who trusted us and to allow the Taliban to abuse district towns. No politician wants to be perceived to have underestimated, or failed to address, a terrorist threat; or to write off the ‘blood and treasure’ that we have sunk into Afghanistan; or to admit defeat. Americans are particularly unwilling to believe that problems are insoluble; Obama’s motto is not ‘no we can’t’; soldiers are not trained to admit defeat or to say a mission is impossible. And to suggest that what worked in Iraq won’t work in Afghanistan requires a detailed knowledge of each country’s past, a bold analysis of the causes of development and a rigorous exposition of the differences, for which few have patience. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The greatest risk of our inflated ambitions </span>and fears, encapsulated <span class="BoldUnderline">in the current surge is that it will achieve the exact opposite of its intentions and in fact precipitate a total withdrawal. The heavier our footprint, and the more costly, the less we are likely to be able to sustain it. Public opinion is already turning against it</span><span class="Underline">.</span> Nato allies are mostly staying in Afghanistan simply to please the United States and have little confidence in our objectives or our reasons. Contemporary political culture tends to encourage black and white solutions: either we garrison or we abandon. While, I strongly oppose troop increases, I equally strongly oppose a total flight. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">We are</span> currently in danger of <span style="background-color: yellow;">lurching from troop increases to withdrawal and from engagement to isolation</span>. We are threatening to provide instant electro-shock therapy followed by abandonment. This is the last thing Afghanistan needs</span><u>.</u> The international community should aim to provide a patient, tolerant long-term relationship with a country as poor and traumatized as Afghanistan. Judging by comparable countries in the developing world (and Afghanistan is very near the bottom of the UN Human Development index), making Afghanistan more stable, prosperous and humane is a project which will take decades. It is a worthwhile project in the long-term for us and for Afghans but <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">we will only </span>be able to <span style="background-color: yellow;">sustain our presence if we </span>massively <span style="background-color: yellow;">reduce our investment</span></span> and our ambitions and begin to approach Afghanistan more as we do other poor countries in the developing world. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">The best way of avoiding</span> the mistakes of the </span>1980s and <span class="BoldUnderline">1990s – <span style="background-color: yellow;">the familiar cycle of investment and abandonment</span> which most Afghan expect and fear and which have contributed so much to instability and danger <span style="background-color: yellow;">- is to</span></span> husband and conserve our resources, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">limit our objectives to counter-terrorism</span></span> and humanitarian assistance and <span class="BoldUnderline">work out how to work <span style="background-color: yellow;">with fewer troops</span></span> and less money over a longer period. In Afghanistan in the long-term, less will be more. </span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">Former national security adviser Henry Kissinger, Council on Foreign Relations scholar Stephen Biddle, and many others, concede that the war in Central Asia will be long, expensive, and risky, yet they claim it is ultimately worth waging because a withdrawal would boost jihadism globally and make America look weak.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif; font-size: 7pt;">26 </span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">But </span><span class="BoldUnderline">what we’ve invested in the Afghanistan mission could all fall apart whether we withdraw tomorrow or 20 years from now. In fact, <span style="background-color: lime;">if leaving would</span> make America <span style="background-color: lime;">look weak, trying to stay indefinitely while accomplishing little would appear</span> even <span style="background-color: lime;">worse</span></span><span style="background-color: lime; color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;"> If the issue is preventing U.S. soldiers from having died in vain, pursuing a losing strategy would not vindicate their sacrifice. And </span><span class="BoldUnderline">trying to pacify all of Afghanistan, much less hoping to do so on a permanent basis, is a losing strategy. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">Regardless, some people invoke memories of America’s ignominious withdrawals from Vietnam, Somalia, and Lebanon to muster support for an open-ended commitment. President Bush in 2007 claimed that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today’s terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility. “Here at home,” he said, “some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently.”</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif; font-size: 7pt;">27 </span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute agrees with that reasoning, writing that “the 1983 withdrawal from Lebanon and the retreat from Somalia a decade later emboldened Islamists who saw the United States as a paper tiger.”</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif; font-size: 7pt;">28 </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">When opinion leaders in Washington talk about “lessons learned” from Vietnam, Somalia, Lebanon, and other conflicts, they typically draw the wrong lesson: not that America should avoid intervening in someone else’s domestic dispute, but that America should never give up after having intervened, no matter what the cost.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif; font-size: 7pt;">29 </span><span style="background-color: lime; color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">But </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">the longer we stay and the more money we spend, the more we’ll feel compelled to remain in the country to validate the investment</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">.

<span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif; margin-left: 0in;">For decades, the fear of America losing the world’s respect after withdrawing from a conflict has been instrumental in selling the American public bad foreign policy. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">Perhaps most troubling about the reflexively “stay the course” mentality of some Americans is the widespread insensitivity about the thousands of people—civilian and military, domestic and foreign—killed, maimed, and traumatized in war.

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">Perhaps the most important argument against the “withdrawal is weak-kneed” meme is that America’s military roams the planet, controls the skies and space, faces no peer competitor, and wields one of the planet’s largest nuclear arsenals. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">America is responsible for almost half of the world’s military spending and can project its power around the globe</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">.

<u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To use the term ‘The Taliban in the singular suggests a homogeneity that is not reflective of the reality. There are multiple factions and insurgents are united by sometimes divergent grievances, whether frustrated Pashtun nationalism, family or tribal feuds, poverty, unemployment, lack of education or resentment at chronic corruption</span></u>. Most are driven more by practical concern as ideological belief. <br />
Given this diversity, we cannot devise a single strategy but rather we need a single overarching objective, which is, alongside the effort against insurgents, an assault on the conditions that give rise to support for them. <br />
There are, I believe, <u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 10pt;">five areas central to achieving this by which we will judge progress</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> and which should command the focus of ally governments and militaries.</span></u><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">First is the legitimacy of the Government</span>. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Legitimacy can only be gained once the government abides by the laws it sets and expects of its population. That means an end to corruption</span></span></u>, greater respect for democr atic institutions and formal governance at a local level – in a country where democracy has only shallow roots. <br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Second is fear and the rule of law. <span style="background-color: yellow;">If the people of Afghanistan live in fear, the insurgency is winning</span>. <span style="background-color: yellow;">To enforce both security and justice we need to build the capacity of</span> the Afghan National <span style="background-color: yellow;">Police </span>and the Afghan National Army<span style="background-color: yellow;">, which relies on improved force recruitment and retention, focusing on training, but also ensuring forces better mirror the ethnic and regional make-</span>up of the areas in which they operate. </span></u><br />
<u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 10pt;"> Third is understanding and overcoming grievance. Insurgency depends on a sense of grievance to survive. Grievance has its roots predominantly in social and economic failure, and the Taliban itself fosters grievance to disrupt the very economic and social advancement which would heighten the chance of the population switching its allegiances away from their ideology.

Pakistan is building a 4th plutonium reactor now – means Indo/Pak arms race is likely now<br />
<span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Warrick, 2/9</span></span> (Joby, Washington Post Staff Writer, “Nuclear experts say Pakistan may be building 4th plutonium reactor,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/09/AR2011020906388.html%202011" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/09/AR2011020906388.html 2011</a>)<br />
<br />
<u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Pakistan has begun work on</span></u> what independent experts say appears to be <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">a fourth plutonium-producing reactor at the country's Khushab nuclear complex, a move that could signal a further escalation in Pakistan's arms race with arch-rival <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/countries/india.html?nav=el" rel="nofollow">__India__</a></span></u>. Commercial <u>satellite photographs taken last month show major new construction at Khushab, a key nuclear installation southwest of Islamabad that generates plutonium for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.</u><br />
<u>The new structure is roughly the same size and shape as two plutonium-producing heavy-water reactors located a few hundreds yards away in the heavily guarded compound, according to an analysis by the I</u>nstitute for <u>S</u>cience and <u>I</u>nternational <u>S</u>ecurity, a Washington organization that studies nuclear proliferation. <br />
<u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The building &quot;appears to be a fourth reactor&quot; for producing weapons-grade plutonium</span></u>, according to <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/pakistan-appears-to-be-building-a-fourth-military-reactor-at-the-khushab-nu/12" rel="nofollow">the ISIS analysis</a>, a copy of which was provided to The Washington Post. ISIS said <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the facility would substantially expand Islamabad's nuclear capacity by allowing it to produce &quot;more plutonium for nuclear bombs.&quot; </span></u><br />
<u>Pakistani officials</u> in Washington, asked about a fourth reactor at Khushab, <u>declined to comment</u>. A U.S. counterproliferation official who reviewed the images declined to comment on the ISIS analysis but said that U.S. intelligence agencies have been monitoring Khushab for years and are &quot;aware of this facility.&quot; <br />
<u>The new reactor</u>, if verified, <u>would signal yet another step forward in Pakistan's ambitious effort to modernize and expand its nuclear arsenal</u>. A Washington Post article last month reported that <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Pakistan's stockpile </span>was estimated to <span style="background-color: yellow;">have grown to more than 100 deployed weapons and to have surpassed that of India</span>. <span style="background-color: yellow;">The rapid growth of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal has fueled fears of an escalating arms race in one of the world's most troubled regions. India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars in 60 years, have launched initiatives in recent years to modernize their nuclear warheads and delivery systems.</span></u><br />
&quot;<u>Another reactor just hammers the point that Pakistan is determined to make a lot of plutonium for nuclear weapons</u>, frankly far more than they need or is healthy for the region and the world,&quot; said ISIS President David Albright, who co-authored the report with researcher Paul Brannan. <br />
The first heavy-water reactor at Khushab became operational in 1996, and a second reactor was inaugurated about a year ago. The two together can generate an estimated 22 kilograms of plutonium a year, enough for up to four bombs. A third reactor is under construction near the second one. <br />
<u>Satellite images</u> provided by ISIS and the commercial imagery firm DigitalGlobe <u>show work underway on a 16,000-square-foot structure that bears a striking resemblance to the second and third reactors</u>. There was no construction at the site when a satellite took photographs of the area in November, Albright said. <br />
Olli Heinonen, former director of safeguards at the International Atomic Energy Agency, said <u>the new reactor was &quot;worrying, given the unstable situation there.&quot;</u><br />
&quot;Commissioning of <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">additional plutonium-production reactors</span></u> and further construction of reprocessing <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">capabilities signify that Pakistan may even be developing second-strike capabilities</span></u>,&quot; <u>said Heinonen</u>, now a <u>senior fellow at Harvard</u> University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. <br />

Pakistan is increasing its nuclear stockpile now – war becomes more destructive if that escalates<br />
<span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Economic Times, 2/22</span></span> (“Pakistan all set to overtake Britain as world's fifth largest nuke power,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/pakistan-all-set-to-overtake-britain-as-worlds-fifth-largest-nuke-power/articleshow/7546912.cms%202011" rel="nofollow">http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/pakistan-all-set-to-overtake-britain-as-worlds-fifth-largest-nuke-power/articleshow/7546912.cms 2011</a>)<br />
<br />
<u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Pakistan</span> is</u> all <u>set to overtake Britain as the world's fifth largest nuclear power</u> as <u>it <span style="background-color: yellow;">has increased its nuclear weapons stockpile by nearly 40 percent in last two years, having more than 100 deployed weapons.</span></u><br />
American intelligence agencies believe that <u>Pakistan now has more than 100 deployed nuclear weapons, an increase of nearly 40 per cent in two years.</u><br />
<u>This makes Pakistan the fifth largest nuclear arsenal power behind the United States, Russia, France and China.</u><br />
<u><span style="background-color: yellow;">F</span>our years ago, the <span style="background-color: yellow;">Pakistani</span> arsenal was estimated at 30</u> to 60 <u>weapons</u>.

<u>Many of these have been miniaturised to be mounted</u> on ballistic missiles with ranges of more than 1,245 miles <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">bringing many Indian cities within reach.</span></u><br />
<u><span style="background-color: yellow;"> The weapons have been kept at depots all over Pakistan</span></u> - some are said to be near the main air bases.<br />

India’s nuclear deterrent stinks – they won’t win and war won’t be contained<br />
<span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bora, 2/9</span></span> (Kukil, SiliconIndia, “<strong>How capable India's nuclear deterrence is?</strong>,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/How_capable_Indias_nuclear_deterrence_is-nid-78630-cid-1.html%202011" rel="nofollow">http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/How_capable_Indias_nuclear_deterrence_is-nid-78630-cid-1.html 2011</a>)<br />
<br />
Bangalore: Although India's interest in nuclear technology was restricted exclusively to its peaceful uses in the beginning, the country's problematic geographic proximity to China had changed the whole scenario. After China tested a nuclear weapon <u>i</u>n 1964, India became concerned of its own nuclear policies. China signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a recognized nuclear weapons state. Unlike China, though <u>India did not sign NPT</u>, <u>its nuclear capability got recognition only after</u> it <u>tested nuclear weapons in 1998</u>. Today, when we analyze <u>the nuclear capability of India</u>, a success story, going from strength to strength, <u>is clearly visible</u>. But how capable India's nuclear deterrence is? Given the fact that<u><span style="background-color: yellow;"> India's nuclear arsenal is estimated between 40 and 80 warheads, which is less than the number of warheads Pakistan has</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow;">,</span> questions are obvious to be raised. True, that today India possesses many nuclear weapons and maintains short and intermediate range ballistic missiles, nuclear-capable aircrafts, ships and submarines under development. But <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the main limitation of India lies in its weak nuclear delivery capability</span>. <span style="background-color: yellow;">India has repeatedly said that it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in case of a war with Pakista</span>n,</u> but experts point out that given its limited delivery capabilities, this would make the country vulnerable in case of war.<br />
While <u>India's naval missile development is aimed at refining its intermediate range capability only, its first-ever nuclear submarine</u> INS Arihant <u>is still undergoing sea trials</u> and is likely to become operational in 2012. Since it doesn't have any operational ballistic missile submarine, <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">India's nuclear weapon delivery at present is limited to nuclear-capable aircraft and surface ships of the navy only</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> Hence <u>the country needs to build up its stockpile of fissile material to correct this soon</u>.<br />
It was in 2003 when <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">India established the Strategic Nuclear Command</span></u>, a join services organization, <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">which is responsible for holding all of India's nuclear weapons</span></u>, missiles and other assets. Although <u>it has the</u> executive <u>responsibility for implementing nuclear policy</u>, the <u>authority to respond to</u> any kind of <u>nuclear strike is in the hands of</u> the Cabinet Committee on Security (<u>CCS</u>) under the Prime Minister. Apart from weakness in strategic decision making process, <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">delayed implementation of decisions is another key limitation.</span></u><br />
Here<u>, China has an upper hand</u>. <u>It enjoys definite advantage over India in</u> three key aspects of exercising nuclear capability in which India is struggling: <u>decision making process, weapons systems, and delivery options</u>. Though exact number of China's nuclear armory is not known, the figure given by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists is around <u>130 nuclear warheads deployed in missiles and aircraft. It has develope</u>d Type 094 <u>ballistic submarines armed with JL 2 SLBMs with a range of 8000 Km</u>. The country has also developed a large submarine base in Hainan which has been cause of concern to the U.S. and India.<br />
It is common knowledge that India has had an unhappy relationship with China, and because of China's nuclear support for Pakistan, India needs to be in nuclear-preparedness. Recently, China has announced to give another two nuclear power stations to Pakistan under a contract in 1991. Given all these, <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">India must do away with the fundamental limitations in augmenting its nuclear weapons capability. </span></u><br />
Here, a closer strategic relation with the U.S. and also nurturing the stagnant Indo-Russian relations can make considerable difference.<br />

Our strategy in Afghanistan is pretty bad, but aside from the obvious broken logic of creating peace through war, I wouldn't say it qualifies as &quot;crazy.&quot; Counterinsurgency is weird in its ability to co-opt humanitarian arguments about human rights and so forth, but it's still somewhat rational considering the military is, after all, a war making institution. But I nearly spit out coffee this morning reading through the new RAND report - &quot;Counterinsurgency in Pakistan&quot; by Seth G. Jones and C. Christine Fair. Of course, it's COIN, so I was prepared for most of the usual junk (&quot;population-centric&quot; bloody occupations, learn from Algeria or the Philippines or [insert incomparable favorite country from a bajillion years ago], etc). This report even had a lot of good stuff going for it, including a very honest assessment of Pakistan's domestic unrest issues (disappearances, land ownership, foreign tariffs, etc) as well as thoughtful examinations of the history of US-Pakistan diplomatic &quot;persuasion&quot; techniques. And then it got crazy fast<span class="BoldUnderline">: The </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"><span class="BoldUnderline">United States</span></span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> should consider more politically valuable initiatives, given the willingness and equities of other regional parties</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">While an effective U.S. role in reaching an Indo-Pakistani accommodation on Kashmir is unlikely</span>, partly because of Indian opposition, there are at least two initiatives that could benefit Pakistan. First is a criteria-based civilian nuclear deal for Pakistan</span>. Pakistan complained about the exceptionalism of the Indo-U.S. nuclear deal, in which India agreed to separate its civil and military nuclear facilities and place its civil nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. In exchange, the United States agreed to work toward full civil nuclear cooperation with India. Pakistani officials argued that its sacrifices in cooperating with the United States should merit comparable consideration. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Pakistan legitimately fears that the agreement may allow India to improve and expand its nuclear weapon arsenal. Pakistan sought to undermine the Indo-U.S. deal, arguing that it would spark an arms race on the subcontinent</span>. That's right, in exchange for &quot;doing more&quot; against the militant elements in the region, the US should give Pakistan more nukes.</span> The report is very honest about it: It'll be just like the deal with India, in which the US basically subsidizes the civilian nuclear industry, and &quot;inspects&quot; it, while the military program remains completely separate and unaccountable<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. <span class="BoldUnderline">Better yet, the military no longer has to compete with the civilian power industry for materials, so they're free to weaponize countless stockpiles of enriched uranium that we specifically agree to not inspect</span></span><span class="BoldUnderline">. That's happening in India right now.</span> And this report says we should do that with Pakistan. For real. This is where I look around, wondering if that sounds as crazy to you as it does to me, because apparently the folks at RAND find nuclear proliferation to be totally normal. Now before we go any further, I should offer a bit of a disclaimer. I'm not one of those liberal hawkish types who wants to scare the bejesus out of you with talk of loose nukes and blowing up American cities. If you want to worry about national security, you're better off figuring out how to fix, say, California's collapsing social programs before you figure out how to stop some Endtimer colonel in the Pakistani Army from going all Rogue Spear on you. And yes, just like anyone else, I think al-Qa'eda blowing up EMPs over New York City is super-duper scary, but so is Jurassic Park and the Terminator, they just don't need to be at the very top of our national security priorities. But there's a difference between making nuclear non-proliferation a reasonable priority, you know, maybe creating jobs at home before signing a treaty with Russia, and flat-out causing proliferation to happen on purpose, in Pakistan of all places. The Indo-US nuclear deal was a terrible idea by itself, for among other things unilaterally negating the IAEA's global non-proliferation regime (India is not a Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty signatory), requiring no limits on the amount of nuclear material produced (power takes a little, weapons take a lot), and completely looking the other way from India's now limitless nuclear weapons program. It is the opposite of nuclear non-proliferation. But here's why it's especially crazy with Pakistan. It would do all of that above, in Pakistan where military control over the nuclear arsenal is often questioned, but it would do it with specific &quot;safeguards&quot;, like this: In exchange for fundamental recognition of its nuclear status and civilian assistance, Pakistan <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would have to meet two criteria: It would have to provide the kind of access and cooperation on nuclear suppliers' network</span>s identified in the Kerry-Lugar-Berman legislation. Pakistan would also have to demonstrate sustained and verifiable commitment in combating all terrorist groups on its soil. Such <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a civilian nuclear deal could achieve the goals that Kerry-Lugar-Berman could not because it would offer Pakistan benefits that it actually values and that only the United States can meaningfully confer</span></span>.[...] It is possible that even this deal may not provide Pakistan adequate incentives to eliminate terror groups or provide access to such individuals as A. Q. Khan. It's possible they won't even get rid of militants, or give up their criminals who sell nuclear secrets to terrorist groups and rogue countries, but we should still totally legitimize and help to expand their nuclear weapons arsenal. Um...what? Again, the report was totally honest. Pakistan complained the India deal would &quot;spark an arms race on the subcontinent.&quot; Well, now we have an arms race on the subcontinent, and this report says we should help the other side. Ostensibly it's to fight militants, maybe get our hands on AQ Khan, but maybe not, we're open. This is what we're actually, seriously discussing for our Afghanistan strategy. <span class="BoldUnderline">This <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would dramatically escalate the already raging nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">At the most awful, worst-case scenario, we're looking at a nuclear exchange between two massive countries</span>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">killing tens if not hundreds of millions of people and likely drawing in China, Russia, the United States and god knows who else. Nuclear World War III</span>.</span> For, you know, counterinsurgency. What the hell happened to this? We got attacked on 9/11 by al-Qa'eda, so now we have to clear Taliban strongholds and stand up the Afghan government because terrorists are a huge threat to the United States. That's straight from President Obama himself. The non-sequiturs in his answer are bad enough, but now we're considering expanding that to include flooding the terror-inflamed Asian subcontinent with unaccountable nuclear weapons and enabling the worst militarist psychoses in Pakistan and India's leadership. Put bluntly, it's putting forward all-out nuclear war as a safeguard against future 9/11 attacks. Not for-sure nuclear war, mind you, just betting it all and rolling the dice on nuclear war. See why this is crazy? This is what COIN has come to, what our trillion dollar occupation has come to. Our longest war is now so utterly hopeless that we have nothing left but considering a nuclear war in Asia as a viable counter-terrorism policy. Yes, it's really that bad. <br />

<span class="BoldUnderline">Overseas presence is a policy instrument: a means to an end, not an end in itself</span><span style="color: black;">. The United States deploys military forces abroad for specific purposes, and the posture, ideally, should reflect these purposes. One purpose is to perform the important but narrow mission of waging war and otherwise carrying out combat operations on short notice. An equally important purpose, however, is political and strategic. Overseas-presence forces are intended to work with the forces of friendly and allied countries, as well as with U.S. forces based in CONUS, to influence the behavior of many countries and therefore to help shape the international environment. Both purposes must be kept in mind when judging the performance of the current posture and future requirements.</span><br />
A <span style="color: black;">legitimate question can be raised about whether the term overseas presence is the best name for this endeavor. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">During the Cold War, the relevant term was forward defense. This term was</span><span style="color: black;"> discarded when the Cold War ended, and it was </span><span class="BoldUnderline">replaced</span><span style="color: black;"> first by forward presence, then </span><span class="BoldUnderline">by overseas presence. One effect</span> <span style="color: black;">has been to strip away provocative connotations; an additional effect </span><span class="BoldUnderline">has been to create a term that seems devoid of purpose or activity. <span style="background-color: lime;">The term overseas presence </span>merely <span style="background-color: lime;">states </span>that U.S. <span style="background-color: lime;">forces are deployed overseas, </span>but it says <span style="background-color: lime;">nothing about their ends </span>and means</span><span style="color: black;">. Perhaps a better term might be overseas security engagement or overseas security commitments, terms that convey a sense of strategic purpose, rather than presence for its own sake.</span><br />

<strong>Afghanistan will inevitably tank Obama’s agenda</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">On the other side of the Atlantic, however, the debate was framed differently. In September 2009, General Stanley McChrystal delivered a classified report to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates which stated that without a comprehensive counterinsurgency strategy and an additional 40,000 troops for Afghanistan the mission would ‘likely result in failure’.4 This call for additional troops to salvage a military campaign that was not going well—and the memories of Vietnam that it evoked—rattled the war-weary American public and caused unease in Washington. </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Aware that escalating the war in Afghanistan could lead to a quagmire and derail his domestic agenda</span>,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> President </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Obama called for a full review of his options before making a decision on troop deployment. Almost immediately, his critics attacked him</span> for dithering</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and portrayed the decision facing him as a stark choice between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency.5 His administration was also divided on this issue. While Robert Gates and the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, were reportedly in favour of General McChrystal’s expanded counterinsurgency plan, the US ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl W. Eikenberry, expressed reservations about deploying more troops in such a capacity.6 VicePresident Joe Biden was even more sceptical about a renewed counterinsurgency campaign and authored a proposal called ‘Counterterrorism Plus’ to convince President Obama that the mission should be limited to targeting Al-Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan.7 Those advocating a counterterrorism approach pointed out that since the US had no legitimate local partner after the flawed elections which returned Hamid Karzai to power, no comprehensive counterinsurgency strategy could be implemented.</span><br />

<span class="BoldUnderline">Some believe that political capital is finite,</span> that it can be used up. To an extent that's true. But it's important to note, too, that <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">political capital can be regenerated</span></span> -- and, specifically, that <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">when a President expends a great deal of capital on a measure that was difficult to enact and then succeeds, he can build up more</span> capital.</span> Indeed, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">that appears to be</span> what is <span style="background-color: yellow;">happening with</span></span> Barack <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Obama, who went to the mat to pass the stimulus package out of the gate, got it passed despite near-unanimous opposition of the Republicans</span></span> on Capitol Hill, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">and is being rewarded by the American public as a result.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As a consequence, the US has adopted a policy of qualified escalation, seeking to pacify Afghanistan through coercive and expansive counter-insurgency</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> (‘clear, hold, build’) operations and a concerted state-building effort to bring order to its politics, contain regional militancy and ensure stability in Pakistan. <span class="BoldUnderline">The <span style="background-color: yellow;">US plans to bring the American troop presence in Afghanistan to a peak of 100,000</span> </span>by late summer 2010, which would represent an increase of nearly a third over the mid-2009 number. Obama’s intention is to begin drawing down the American presence in Afghanistan in July 2011. </span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 10pt;">Yet the coalition effort in Afghanistan appears increasingly problematic. Despite effective US-led offensives in early 2010</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – notably in Marja, in Helmand Province – <span class="BoldUnderline">the Taliban is proving to be resilient</span>. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has resisted US pressure to root out corruption, and is growing more distant from Washington, but his authority remains hard to sidestep. <span class="BoldUnderline">US-led training programmes for the Afghan army and especially the national police have been revealed as flawed, wasteful and ineffectual</span>. At the same time, <span class="BoldUnderline">the ‘drone war’ against al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders in the tribal areas of Pakistan has continued to be highly effective, and a stepped-up effort over the past three months appears to have discouraged them from building up operational bases</span>. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Accordingly, <span class="BoldUnderline">it may transpire that the full-blooded counter-insurgency and state-building effort embodied by Obama’s current Afghanistan policy is not</span>, in fact, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">necessary to protect vital American interests in establishing sufficient regional stability</span> </span>and denying al-Qaeda a safe haven in Central and South Asia. In that case, after the health-care success, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">the Obama administration might judge that readjusting Afghanistan policy to set less ambitious goals might prove less vulnerable to conservative retaliation</span></span> – particularly <span class="BoldUnderline">if the US public becomes uneasy with sustained American casualties and little progress to show for them. Given the central importance of an acceptable result in Afghanistan to Obama’s foreign policy, it is conceivable that he could again change course there.</span> However, since he has already hedged the existing policy by building in the date of July 2011 for de-escalation to commence, he may wait until then to take stock.</span><br />

<strong>Political capital doesn’t influence the passage of legislation – issues are compartmentalized and presidential influence is exaggerated by the media.</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As for Sotomayor, from here the path toward almost certain confirmation goes as follows: the Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hold hearings sometime this summer (this involves both written depositions and of course open hearings), which should lead to formal Senate approval before Congress adjourns for its summer recess in early August. So Sotomayor will likely take her seat in time for the start of the new Court session on October 5. (I talk briefly about the likely politics of the nomination process below). What is of more interest to me, however, is what her selection reveals about the basis of presidential power. </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Political scientists</span>, like baseball writers evaluating hitters, <span style="background-color: yellow;">have devised numerous means of measuring a president’s influence in Congress.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I will devote a separate post to discussing these, but in brief, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">they often center on the creation of legislative “box scores” designed to measure how many times a president’s preferred piece of legislation, or nominee to the executive branch or the courts, is approved by Congress. That is, how many pieces of legislation that the president supports actually pass Congress? How often do members of Congress vote with the president’s preferences?</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> How often is a president’s policy position supported by roll call outcomes? </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">These measures</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">however, </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">are a misleading gauge of presidential power – they are a better indicator of congressional power.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This is because </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">how members of Congress vote on a</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nominee or </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">legislative item is rarely influenced by anything a president does. Although journalists (and political scientists) often focus on the legislative “endgame” to gauge presidential influence – will the President swing enough votes to get his preferred legislation enacted? – this mistakes an outcome with actual evidence of presidential influence. Once we control for other factors – </span>a member of Congress’ ideological and partisan leanings, the political leanings of her constituency, whether she’s up for reelection or not – <span style="background-color: yellow;">we can usually predict how she will vote without needing to know much of anything about what the president wants</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (I am ignoring the importance of a president’s veto power for the moment</span><span class="BoldUnderline">.) Despite the much publicized and celebrated instances of presidential arm-twisting during the legislative endgame, then, most legislative outcomes don’t depend on presidential lobbying.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But this is not to say that presidents lack influence. Instead, the primary means by which presidents influence what Congress does is through their ability to determine the alternatives from which Congress must choose. That is, presidential power is largely an exercise in agenda-setting – not arm-twisting. And we see this in the Sotomayer nomination. Barring a major scandal, she will almost certainly be confirmed to the Supreme Court whether Obama spends the confirmation hearings calling every Senator or instead spends the next few weeks ignoring the Senate debate in order to play Halo III on his Xbox. That is, how senators decide to vote on Sotomayor will have almost nothing to do with Obama’s lobbying from here on in (or lack thereof). His real influence has already occurred, in the decision to present Sotomayor as his nominee. If we want to measure Obama’s “power”, then, we need to know what his real preference was and why he chose Sotomayor. My guess – and it is only a guess – is that after conferring with leading Democrats and Republicans, he recognized the overriding practical political advantages accruing from choosing an Hispanic woman, with left-leaning credentials. We cannot know if this would have been his ideal choice based on judicial philosophy alone, but presidents are never free to act on their ideal preferences. Politics is the art of the possible. Whether Sotomayer is his first choice or not, however, her nomination is a reminder that the power of the presidency often resides in the president’s ability to dictate the alternatives from which Congress (or in this case the Senate) must choose. Although Republicans will undoubtedly attack Sotomayor for her judicial “activism” (citing in particular her decisions regarding promotion and affirmative action), her comments regarding the importance of gender and ethnicity in influencing her decisions, and her views regarding whether appellate courts “make” policy, they run the risk of alienating Hispanic voters – an increasingly influential voting bloc (to the extent that one can view Hispanics as a voting bloc!) I find it very hard to believe she will not be easily confirmed. In structuring the alternative before the Senate in this manner, then, Obama reveals an important aspect of presidential power that cannot be measured through legislative boxscores.</span><br />

<strong>COIN is increasingly unpopular with Democrats and Republicans</strong><br />
<strong><u>Washington Times</u></strong> <u><strong>9</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Kim R. Holmes SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES, 8/20/09, &quot;What's the Big Idea: Obama facing the tests of war in Afghanistan amid elections&quot;, lexis)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">All this is true. But keeping his promise to win the &quot;good&quot; war in Afghanistan won't be easy. </span><u>The president will face many tests along the way. Starting now.</u><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The first test is in responding to the outcome of Thursday's elections in Afghanistan. The Obama administration has not yet figured out how to integrate successfully its nation-building efforts at the central government level with the much harder work of dealing with local factions and tribes susceptible to Taliban intimidation.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">If the elections simply ratify the status quo in Kabul, the disconnect between central and local governance will likely continue. Corruption is undermining the legitimacy of the Afghan government, and legitimacy is critical in building up a strong Afghan army - as well as U.S. counterinsurgency efforts in the countryside. Until corruption is at least minimized, the war cannot be won.</span><br />
<u>The second test is whether Mr. Obama will back his new strategy in Afghanistan with the resources needed to make it work. The administration's policy, unveiled in March, puts a high priority on protecting Afghan civilians as part of a counterinsurgency strategy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">There is already pushback from</span> some <span style="background-color: yellow;">Democrats</span></u></strong> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">who insist the Afghan &quot;quagmire&quot; will cost too much and drain resources from domestic programs.</span> Mr. Obama 's habit of trying to have it both ways - tacking back and forth between tough and soft statements and ultimately splitting the difference on policy - may not convince these Democrats in the long run</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Mr. Obama will probably end up trying to keep his liberal critics at bay by giving Gen. Stan McChrystal fewer troops than he needs.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">That would produce an ever-worse dilemma down the road. Insufficient troops will minimize battlefield success, ultimately prolonging the war. The longer the war lasts, the more criticism Mr. Obama will face from his political base. Time is not on his side politically, and his antiwar position on Iraq actually puts him in a politically weaker position than former President George W. Bush was on war policies. </span><u>Mr. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Obama 's base is not only more hostile to some of his policies, but far less patient should he make unpopular decisions.</span></u><br />
<u>That could lead to Mr. Obama 's third big test - one that could actually be his undoing. Whether the president knows it or not, his biggest allies on Afghanistan are pro-national security conservatives. Yet he still gives defensive speeches, as he did this week before the Veterans of Foreign Wars, attacking Sen. John McCain of Arizona and other conservatives over the war in Iraq</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This makes no sense. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">If he is serious about winning in Afghanistan, he needs to stop this divisive rhetoric and realize that his Afghan policies face a potential challenge from the right flank as</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> well.</span><br />
<u>So far, most conservatives are holding strong behind the war effort. But there <span style="background-color: yellow;">already are rumblings among some conservatives that &quot;Obama 's war&quot; may not be worth fighting.</span> Far more threatening than traditional isolationist or libertarian antiwar arguments are so-called <span style="background-color: yellow;">conservative realists </span>who <span style="background-color: yellow;">may conclude that only a minimalist effort is all that is possible</span> - or worse, needed - in Afghanistan. Such people may come to think that the U.S. is caught in the &quot;graveyard of empires,&quot; a place where the more we try to do, the worse the problem gets.</u><br />
<u>It's not that Mr. Obama will face a conservative revolt against the war in Afghanistan. But <span style="background-color: yellow;">when he needs conservatives to face down the dovish left wing of his own party, he may not find them eager allies.</span></u><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Even as President Obama contemplates how large a force of additional troops to send to Afghanistan, he reflected a growing concern last week that the war will deteriorate into a more protracted and bloody conflict. The president told reporters traveling with him on a weeklong tour of East Asia that he wants an “endgame” to the Afghanistan conflict so he won’t have to hand off the war to his successor. In doing so, Obama clearly indicated that he has his eye on a political clock that might run out in as few as three years. NOT ENOUGH TROOPS: As Marine patrols like the one above try to recapture Taliban-held areas, U.S. commanders are requesting as many as 40,000 more troops to carry out their mission. President Obama says he will give his answer soon. (Source: GETTY IMAGES / JOE RAEDLE.) </span><u>On Capitol Hill, however, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the Afghanistan clock is ticking much faster.</span> With the war now in its ninth year, <span style="background-color: yellow;">patience at home is wearing thin</span>. And a growing chorus of lawmakers is now saying <span style="background-color: yellow;">Obama has much less time before public support for the war</span> — now below 50 percent — erodes to the point of collapse. The Democrats’ greatest fear is that the tipping point might occur just before the 2010 midterm elections — an awkward convergence of events that may imperil their jobs and jeopardize further congressional support for the war</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>So as Obama weighs a request</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, his top commander in Afghanistan, </span><u>for as many as 40,000 additional combat troops, lawmakers are focusing on their own political liabilities, which are the manifold costs of the conflict — in deaths, in dollars and in the deterioration of the military’s readiness to fight the next war. And they emphatically dismiss <span style="background-color: yellow;">Obama’s multi-year time table, warning that whatever strategy he chooses must begin to show real progress by next fall at the latest</span>. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Otherwis</span>e, they warn, <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">Democrats will abandon him</span></strong></u><strong>.</strong> <u>“He does not have that kind of time,” said Pennsylvania Democrat John P. Murtha,</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, noting that many fellow Democrats rode into Congress on a wave of anti-war sentiment in the last two elections. </span><u>“This will affect not only his election, this will affect our election.” Already, the number of soldiers who have been killed in Afghanistan is approaching the watershed 1,000 mark</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while thousands more have been horribly wounded and disfigured. </span><u>Such casualty counts don’t include legions of servicemembers who suffer from debilitating psychological wounds that have resulted in catastrophic levels of anguish and suicide. <span style="background-color: yellow;">With Obama expected to send over additional troops, all categories of casualties are certain to climb, <strong>further taxing public support for the war</strong></span> if the expected buildup doesn’t produce results quickly Lawmakers are also concerned about the financial cost of the Afghanistan fighting. Since U.S. troops invaded the country in late 2001, the war has cost U.S. taxpayers almost $227 billion. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Congress is poised to provide almost $73 billion more for continuing operations this fiscal year.</span> And for every 1,000 additional troops Obama sends to Afghanistan, the price will jump by $1 billion per year</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. At a time when the nation’s economy is still fragile and unemployment remains high, </span><u>big increases in defense spending are virtually guaranteed to spark debate over the president’s priorities. <span class="Underline">And then there is the cost of depleting the military’s readiness to fight in some other corner of the world, if called upon to do so. Almost a decade of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq has worn down much of the military’s equipment and exhausted its ranks of experienced combat veterans</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and the military’s focus on counterinsurgency operations has left it ill-trained for conventional conflicts. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Individually, each of these rising costs would generate major concern for lawmakers</span>. Taken together, they confront Congress like a cluster of time bombs, all potentially set to explode in the fall of 2010, or certainly by 2012 if conditions in Afghanistan don’t improve by then</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The administration is also mindful of the looming political dangers of a war with too many costs. Last week, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Kabul, where she urged President Hamid Karzai to strengthen his government’s accountability, a move that would give Congress greater confidence in U.S. military efforts there. Right now, the strongest support for the president’s plans for the war comes from Republicans, who have been urging Obama to approve McChrystal’s full troop request. War boosters argue that the 40,000 additional troops will tamp down the violence in Afghanistan and that the resulting stability will, in turn, shore up political support at home, just as George W. Bush’s 2007 surge of forces in Iraq eventually helped mollify critics of that conflict. An Increasingly Dangerous Place: Click Here to View Chart </span><u>Many <span style="background-color: yellow;">Democrats,</span> however, <span style="background-color: yellow;">fear the political consequences if a buildup of forces doesn’t produce results</span>, at least before the sands in their political hourglass run out. Although most lawmakers have been supportive of the war in Afghanistan — launched with overwhelming approval by the public and Congress after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks — <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">they cannot ignore recent opinion surveys that for the first time show that half the country feels the war is no longer worth the cost</span>.</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Congress is unlikely to deny Obama the billions of dollars in appropriations for his troop buildup, which would probably be provided in a supplemental spending bill sometime next year. And experts say Congress </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">may not deny future increases in spending either. Nonetheless, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">dampened voter enthusiasm suggests that an increasingly unpopular war would be difficult for the president to wage successfully without considerable political cost to himself and his party, experts say</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">“Many parts of the Democratic base will be sitting on their hands in the next election because they are so disenchanted,” said John Mueller, a political scientist at Ohio State University and an expert on public opinion in wartime. </span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Still, history shows that Americans can withstand substantial pain if they believe the military is winning a war, said Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who worked on the National Security Council during the Clinton and Bush administrations. A corollary thought is that when Americans become dissatisfied with a war’s progress, either because of increasing violence or mounting casualties, public support erodes. In that light, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Obama’s explanation of his new Afghanistan strategy and its benchmarks of progress will be as critical as his decision on additional forces, lawmakers say.</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> “A lot depends on the case that the president makes and the expectations that he sets when he announces his troop deployment decision,” said Susan Collins of Maine, a member the Senate Armed Services Committee and one of the few Republicans who is skeptical about adding forces in Afghanistan. “If he decides to follow Gen. McChrystal’s recommendation, or comes close to it, and presents to Congress and the American people a rationale, people will give him additional time — how long exactly, I don’t know,” she said. “I would think the public would want to see improvement by next year at this time, certainly.” The real drivers of public opinion, of course, will be events in Afghanistan, not presidential speeches. If security doesn’t improve there, more and more voters may abandon a cause they once overwhelmingly supported. “If the Democrats are in trouble come September, October 2010, and it’s viewed as, to a significant extent, because of the war, then I think their constituents are going to argue for a shift,” said Andrew F.

<span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Bold,serif;">Myth #3: Withdrawal Would Erode America’s Global Status</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">Former national security adviser Henry Kissinger, Council on Foreign Relations scholar Stephen Biddle, and many others, concede that the war in Central Asia will be long, expensive, and risky, yet they claim it is ultimately worth waging because a withdrawal would boost jihadism globally and make America look weak.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif; font-size: 7pt;">26 </span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">But </span><span class="BoldUnderline">what we’ve invested in the Afghanistan mission could all fall apart whether we withdraw tomorrow or 20 years from now. In fact, <span style="background-color: yellow;">if leaving would</span> make America <span style="background-color: yellow;">look weak, trying to stay indefinitely while accomplishing little would appear</span> even <span style="background-color: yellow;">worse</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">. If the issue is preventing U.S. soldiers from having died in vain, pursuing a losing strategy would not vindicate their sacrifice. And </span><span class="BoldUnderline">trying to pacify all of Afghanistan, much less hoping to do so on a permanent basis, is a losing strategy.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">Regardless, some people invoke memories of America’s ignominious withdrawals from Vietnam, Somalia, and Lebanon to muster support for an open-ended commitment. President Bush in 2007 claimed that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today’s terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility. “Here at home,” he said, “some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently.”</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif; font-size: 7pt;">27 </span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute agrees with that reasoning, writing that “the 1983 withdrawal from Lebanon and the retreat from Somalia a decade later emboldened Islamists who saw the United States as a paper tiger.”</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif; font-size: 7pt;">28</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">When opinion leaders in Washington talk about “lessons learned” from Vietnam, Somalia, Lebanon, and other conflicts, they typically draw the wrong lesson: not that America should avoid intervening in someone else’s domestic dispute, but that America should never give up after having intervened, no matter what the cost.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif; font-size: 7pt;">29 </span><span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">But </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">the longer we stay and the more</span> money <span style="background-color: yellow;">we spend</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the more we’ll feel compelled to remain in the country to validate the investment</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">. A similar self-imposed predicament plagued U.S. officials during the war in Vietnam:</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">After 1968 it became increasingly clear that the survival of the [government of South Vietnam] was not worth the cost of securing it, but by then the United States had another rationale for staying— prestige and precedent setting. The United States said the [South Vietnamese government] would stand, and even those in the administration now long convinced of the hollowness of the domino argument could agree that a U.S. failure in South Vietnam might endanger vital US national interests elsewhere or in the future.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif; font-size: 7pt;">30</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">For decades, the fear of America losing the world’s respect after withdrawing from a conflict has been instrumental in selling the American public bad foreign policy.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">Perhaps most troubling about the reflexively “stay the course” mentality of some Americans is the widespread insensitivity about the thousands of people—civilian and military, domestic and foreign—killed, maimed, and traumatized in war. But when the stakes seem unrelated to vital national interests, the American public rightly resents their country’s interference in third party problems, and is extremely skeptical of nation building. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">History shows that, sooner or later, <span style="background-color: yellow;">disenchantment will manifest in public and congressional opposition. After</span> nearly <span style="background-color: yellow;">a decade</span> in Afghanistan, even the memory of <span style="background-color: yellow;">9/11 might not be sufficient to outweigh the sacrifice in blood and treasure</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">Perhaps the most important argument against the “withdrawal is weak-kneed” meme is that America’s military roams the planet, controls the skies and space, faces no peer competitor, and wields one of the planet’s largest nuclear arsenals. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">America is responsible for almost half of the world’s military spending and can project its power around the globe</span><span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">. Thus, </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">the contention that America would appear “weak” after withdrawing from Afghanistan is ludicrous</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow; color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-family: LegacySerif-Book,serif;">Unfortunately, bureaucratic inertia and a misplaced conception of Washington’s moral obligations (an argument that more often than not legitimizes America’s military occupation of a foreign people) threaten to trap the United States in Afghanistan for decades. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Overall, <span style="background-color: yellow;">remaining in Afghanistan is more likely to tarnish America’s reputation and undermine U.S. security than would withdrawal</span></span><br />

What will happen if the current surge for Iraq becomes the steady state, and the Army and Marines are not resourced with the people, units and equipment they need for a long-term fight? When will the dedication and sacrifice of our troops run up against the needs of families and communities? Will they vote with their feet?

These American traditions, together with historical events beyond Americans’ control, have catapulted the United States to a position of pre-eminence in the world.

Finally, in the wake of the Iraq War and with hostility to the United States, as measured in public opinion polls, apparently at an all-time high, there has been a widespread assumption that the American position in the world must finally be eroding. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Yet American predominance in the main categories of power persists as a key feature of the international system.

<strong>Loss of Hegemony causes Lashout, <u>not</u> restraint</strong><br />

Two implications follow from the United States' strange condition as &quot;economically dependent and politically useless.&quot; First, the United States is becoming a global economic predator, sustaining itself through an increasingly fragile system of &quot;tribute taking.&quot; It has lost the ability to couple its own economic gain with the economic advancement of other societies. Second, <u>a kened U<span style="text-decoration: none;">nited </span>S<span style="text-decoration: none;">tates</span> will resort to more desperate and aggressive actions to retain its hegemonic position.</u> Todd identifies this impulse behind confrontations with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Indeed, in his most dubious claim, Todd argues that the corruption of U.S. democracy is giving rise to a poorly supervised ruling class that will be less restrained in its use of military force against other democracies, those in Europe included. For Todd, all of this points to the disintegration of the American empire. <br />
Todd is correct that the ability of any state to dominate the international system depends on its economic strength. As economic dominance shifts, American unipolarity will eventually give way to a new distribution of power. But, contrary to Todd's diagnosis, the United States retains formidable socioeconomic advantages. And his claim that a rapacious clique of frightened oligarchs has taken over U.S. democracy is simply bizarre. Most important, Todd's assertion that Russia and other great powers are preparing to counterbalance U.S. power misses the larger patterns of geopolitics. Europe, Japan, Russia, and China have sought to engage the United States strategically, not simply to resist it. They are pursuing influence and accommodation within the existing order, not trying to overturn it. In fact, <u>the great powers worry more about a detached, isolationist U<span class="Style1"><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">nited </span></span>S<span class="Style1"><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">tates</span></span> than</u> <span class="Style1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">they do about</span></span> <u>a U<span class="Style1"><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">nited </span></span>S<span class="Style1"><span style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: none;">tates</span></span> bent on global rule</u>.

<strong>Multipolarity incentivizes great power conflict – only unipolarity can solve – prefer our analysis, its based in more scientifically validated methods</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">William </span><strong><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Wohlforth </span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(professor of government at Dartmouth College) </span><span class="TagsChar2">200</span><strong><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">9</span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “ Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War” Project Muse </span><br />
<br />
The upshot is a near scholarly consensus that unpolarity’s consequences for great power conflict are indeterminate and that a power shift resulting in a return to bipolarity or multipolarity will not raise the specter of great power war. This article questions the consensus on two counts. First, I show that <span class="BoldUnderline">it depends crucially on a dubious assumption about human motivation.</span> Prominent <span class="BoldUnderline">theories of war are based on the assumption that people are mainly motivated by the instrumental pursuit of tangible ends such as physical security and material prosperity.</span> This is why <span class="BoldUnderline">such <span style="background-color: silver;">theories seem irrelevant to interactions among great powers</span></span> in an international environment that diminishes the utility of war for the pursuit of such ends. Yet we know that <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: silver;">people are motivated by a great many noninstrumental motives</span></span>, not least by concerns regarding their social status. 3 As John Harsanyi noted, “Apart from economic payoffs, <span class="BoldUnderline">social status</span> (social rank) <span class="BoldUnderline">seems to be the most important incentive and motivating force of social behavior</span>.”4 <span class="BoldUnderline">This proposition rests on much firmer scientific ground</span> now than when Harsanyi expressed it a generation ago, <span class="BoldUnderline">as cumulating research shows that <span style="background-color: silver;">humans appear to be hardwired for sensitivity to status</span> and that relative standing is a powerful and independent motivator of behavior</span>.5 [End Page 29] Second, I question the dominant view that status quo evaluations are relatively independent of the distribution of capabilities. If the status of states depends in some measure on their relative capabilities, and if states derive utility from status, then different distributions of capabilities may affect levels of satisfaction, just as different income distributions may affect levels of status competition in domestic settings. 6 Building on research in psychology and sociology, I argue that even capabilities distributions among major powers foster ambiguous status hierarchies, which generate more dissatisfaction and clashes over the status quo. And the more stratified the distribution of capabilities, the less likely such status competition is. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: silver;">Unipolarity</span> </span>thus generates <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: silver;">far fewer incentives than either bipolarity or multipolarity for direct great power positional competition</span> over status. Elites in the other major powers continue to prefer higher status, but <span style="background-color: silver;">in a unipolar system they face comparatively weak incentives to translate that preference into costly action</span>.</span> And <span class="BoldUnderline">the absence of such incentives matters because social status is a positional good</span>—something whose value depends on how much one has in relation to others.7 “If everyone has high status,” Randall Schweller notes, “no one does.”8 <span class="BoldUnderline">While one actor might increase its status, all cannot simultaneously do so.

<br />
Most <span class="BoldUnderline">scholars hold that</span> the consequences of unipolarity for great power conflict are indeterminate and that a <span class="BoldUnderline">power shift resulting in a return to bipolarity or multipolarity will not raise the specter of great power war. This</span> article <span class="BoldUnderline">calls into question the core assumptions underlying the consensus</span>: (1) that people are mainly motivated by the instrumental pursuit of tangible ends such as physical security and material prosperity and (2) that major powers’ satisfaction with the status quo is relatively independent of the distribution of capabilities. In fact, it is known that people are motivated powerfully by a noninstrumental concern for relative status, and there is strong empirical evidence linking the salience of those concerns to distributions of resources. If the status of states depends in some measure on their relative capabilities and if states derive utility from status, then different distributions of capabilities may affect levels of satisfaction, just as different income distributions may affect levels of status competition in domestic settings. Building on research in psychology and sociology, the author argues that <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: silver;">even capabilities distributions among major powers foster ambiguous status hierarchies, which generate</span> more d</span>issatisfaction and <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: silver;">clashes</span> over the status quo</span>. And the more stratified the distribution of capabilities, the less likely such status competition is. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: silver;">Unipolarity thus augurs for great power peace, and a shift back to bipolarity or multipolarity raises the probability of war</span> even <span style="background-color: silver;">among great powers with little material cause to fight.</span></span><br />

<strong>Withdrawal not on top of US-India relations agenda – multiple alt causes</strong><br />
Ashley J. <strong><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">Tellis</span></span></strong> NOVEMBER 5, 20<span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>10</strong> (“</span></span>Reimagining U.S.-India Relations” <br />

<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">There is a wide-ranging agenda</span> for the visit.</span> In fact, I fear that the agenda is so wide ranging that the visit could actually lose focus, but let me identify some key areas that matter to both sides. <br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">The first is <span style="background-color: lime;">diplomatic consultation</span></span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">This is critical because the United States is deeply involved in Afghanistan and Pakistan and these are areas that matter to India</span>. There is a complication in U.S.-China relations at the moment having to do with currency and the nature of the global economic system and this is an issue that is also important to India. Depending on how the currency question is resolved, India could see a major inflow of foreign investment which the economy may be unable to handle. So, these are two areas that are important for the Indians and therefore diplomatic consultation is going to be high on the agenda. <br />
The second is the area of trade and this involves <span class="BoldUnderline">increasing market access to both sides</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">The U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">wants greater access to the Indian market in retail and dairy products, and the Indians want greater access to the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">with respect to portfolio investments for the specter branch banking. So, there’s a whole range of economic issues that are on the agenda. </span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">The third</span> area <span class="BoldUnderline">is </span>closing <span class="BoldUnderline">all the <span style="background-color: lime;">uncertainties related to India’s nuclear liability</span> legislation and satisfying the U</span>nited <span class="BoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="BoldUnderline">that there is in fact a level playing field for American companies.</span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">The fourth is defense and <span style="background-color: lime;">space cooperation</span></span> as there is a wide agenda here that involves both sides. <span class="BoldUnderline">There is an agreement that has been pending called the Commercial Space Launch Agreement which has been pending since 2004 and both sides are hoping to close on</span>. There is a great deal of things that need to done in the area of defense cooperation beyond just weapon sales, including joint exercises. It is a very ambitious agenda of how both countries can work together and there are foundational agreements that the United States hopes India will sign. <br />
<span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">There are</span> also areas that <span style="background-color: lime;">are going to be on the table relating to energy, science and technology, education, and public health</span></span>. And so when one looks at it, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: lime;">there really is a soup to nuts agenda that will occupy both sides. The challenge will be actually drilling down on two or three key areas that will help define the visit as opposed to dealing with all these and then being lost in</span> a morass of <span style="background-color: lime;">multiple</span> issues. </span><br />

Detente with China might then seem to be in India’s interest. After all, </span><span class="AuthorDate">China wants a stable Afghanistan for trade routes; India, for security. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Because of India’s history and geography, </span><span class="AuthorDate">an American failure in Afghanistan bodes ill for our bilateral relationship with New Delhi</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">.

I do not suggest that we should commit so much money and national treasure to Afghanistan merely for the sake of impressing India. But I am suggesting that </span><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="background-color: lime; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">the deleterious effect on U.S.-India bilateral relations of giving up on Afghanistan should be part of our national debate on the war effort there</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, for at the moment it is not. The fact is that our ability to influence China will depend greatly on our ability to work with India, and that, in turn, will depend greatly on how we perform in Afghanistan. The problem I have with this argument is that it suggests that somehow, Afghanistan can be described in the context of a single point of failure in some Grand Strategy for global balance of power for the United States. I see that as artificial inflation regarding the importance of Afghanistan. India, not the US or any NATO nation, already has more influence in determining the outcome in Afghanistan because India, not the US or any NATO nation, is the largest economic power besides China in the region around Afghanistan (thus has the most to lose in the region). It is almost treated as an afterthought that Iraq's major trade partners include Syria, Turkey, and Jordan - and btw, the country Iraq has the largest growth in trade with today is Iran, while the second fastest trade growth is with UAE. There is no way stability in Iraq is possible without the cooperation of regional nations around Iraq. The nations surrounding Iraq are invested in the stability in Iraq both politically and economically now - and that is why we can leave with a fairly reasonable degree of confidence that Iraq will mature over time. The same holds true for Afghanistan. The US military and allies will not eventually 'win' the war in Afghanistan, success in Afghanistan will only be achieved once the nations around Afghanistan - including Iran, Pakistan, India, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and China - have a sufficiently invested interest in the stability of Afghanistan. Without that regional investment, the operation is simply a military manhunt with no end in sight. I do not agree that US grand strategy in balancing rising powers is dependent upon our perpetual manhunt in Afghanistan, indeed I would argue that when we exaggerate a small war against a relatively small group of bad guys in Afghanistan and turn that into a major war with significant but artificial global national security ramifications, that does significantly more harm to any US grand strategy that balances rising powers. Don't misunderstand - I am not calling for a unilateral withdrawal from Afghanistan, rather I believe </span><span class="AuthorDate">our military strategy there should reflect that</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">:</span><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="background-color: lime; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Afghanistan is a small war, not a major war. Small wars are best fought with small footprints</span> Regional investment in stability in Afghanistan is the only way to achieve stability</span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">in Afghanistan Failure in Afghanistan isn't when the US fails to achieve stability and peace, rather failure is achieved when stability and peace in Afghanistan allows regional acceptance for control of Afghanistan to be achieved by forces intent on terrorist activities outside of Afghanistan. Kaplan is wrong if he believes violence in Afghanistan threatens the balance of power between major powers. It is not only possible, but statistically probable that violence in Afghanistan will exist in 2020 and beyond, and that violence will have very limited influence on the strategic policies of India regarding any balance of power issues between major powers l<!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:84:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@LastEdit&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: LastEdit&quot;/&gt; --><a name="LastEdit"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:84 -->ike the US and China. </span></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 20pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">As instability and violence in Afghanistan intensify, and the policymakers in the U.S. grapple with the right strategy -- counter-insurgency or counter-terrorism -- </span><span class="AuthorDate">New Delhi has indicated a ‘strategic shift’ in thinking from a military to political solution to the Afghan war</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">. In an interview to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna said </span><span class="AuthorDate">India did “not believe that war can solve any problem and that applies to Afghanistan too.”</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> There has been a significant shift in New Delhi’s thinking in the political uncertainty following the recently-held Afghan polls, in which allegations of fraud have marred the early claims of President Hamid Karzai’s victory. Afghanistan’s Election Commission has called a runoff for November 7 after investigations dropped Mr. Karzai’s votes below 50 per cent. Alternatively, intense diplomacy to cobble together a national unity government is being explored to avoid the scenario of a ‘runoff.’ Without a legitimate government in place, the troop surge could come to resemble foreign occupation. Such concerns confront President Obama, who awaits the ending of the political stalemate before sending more troops. </span><span class="AuthorDate">India expressed support for a ‘national unity’ government. There is also a recognition of the need for a reconciliation process in building a politically inclusive order</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">.

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">A second, and related, problem is that </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">the target set for the application of lethal force tends to expand</span> over time from <span style="background-color: yellow;">counterterror</span>ism <span style="background-color: yellow;">targets to ones associated with</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">co</span>unter<span style="background-color: yellow;">in</span>surgency effort</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.

<span class="BoldUnderline">The effects of this ‘mission creep’ can be seen with commando raids and the use of Predator drones in Pakistan.

The center is an intelligence “fusion cell” that collates American surveillance with human intelligence collected by Pakistani and Afghan agencies to come up with target projections. “This is about building trust,” said a senior U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the program has not been publicly acknowledged. “This is about giving them capabilities they do not currently have to help them defeat this radical extreme element that is in their country” (Barnes&amp;Miller, 2009). <span class="BoldUnderline">The drone attacks have come under scathing criticism from Pakistani political parties and media for igniting the causal loop of militant indoctrination by causing collateral damage, and the ensuing radicalization of affected persons</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">However, there has been evidence that they are not all that unpopular in the affected areas, particularly if they took out the militants while causing minimum collateral damage. The Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy </span>(AIRRA) <span class="BoldUnderline">published the results of a survey</span> (<em>The News</em>, March 5, 2009) during which research teams visitedWana (SouthWaziristan), Ladda (SouthWaziristan), Miranshah (North Waziristan), Razmak (North Waziristan), and Parachinar (Kurram Agency); <span class="BoldUnderline">the findings were surprising inasmuch as the <span style="background-color: yellow;">victim population was not</span> wholly <span style="background-color: yellow;">opposed to drone attacks</span>. </span><br />
The AIRRA conducted the survey with the help of 650 structured questionnaires; 550 persons replied, with 100 declining to respond. The questions were as follows:<br />
1. Do you see drone attacks bringing about fear and terror in the common people? (Yes 45%, No 55%).<br />
2. Do you think the drones are accurate in their strikes? (Yes 52%, No 48%).<br />
3. Do you think anti-American feelings in the area increased due to drone attacks recently? (Yes 42%, No 58%).<br />
<em>Negotiations and the Anti-Taliban Counterinsurgency in Pakistan 269</em><br />
4. Should the Pakistani military carry out targeted strikes at the militant organizations? (Yes 70%, No 30%).<br />
5. Do the militant organizations get damaged due to drone attacks? (Yes 60%, No 40%).<br />
Thus, <span style="background-color: yellow;">e<span class="BoldUnderline">ven though there are widespread expressions vented to the contrary by the media and politicians in Pakistan, the victim population does not seem</span></span><span class="BoldUnderline"> too <span style="background-color: yellow;">unhappy about</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">drones taking out Taliban leadership</span>, especially <span style="background-color: yellow;">if the state is perceived as</span> being <span style="background-color: yellow;">unable to do so</span>.</span> In the future, observers of the conflict may be surprised to find jointly controlled drone operations carried out by Pakistanis and Americans, since the state of affairs seems to be foreseeably moving in that direction, despite violent opposition to the concept widespread in Pakistani society.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Thus, </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">if the core concern is terrorism</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Washington should concentrate on</span> its already effective policy of <span style="background-color: yellow;">eliminating al Qaeda's leadership with drone strikes</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In what amounts to a targeted killing program, the </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">U</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates</span><span class="BoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">uses</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> two types of unmanned aerial vehicles - </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">the Predator and the</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> faster, higher-altitude </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Reaper</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which can carry two Hellfire missiles and precision-guided bombs - </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">to attack individuals and safe houses associated with al Qaeda</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and related militant groups, such as the Haqqani network. Most of these strikes have taken place in North or Soudi Waziristan, as deep as 25 miles into Pakistani territory. There were about 36 against militant sites inside Pakistan in 2008, and there have been approximately 16 so far in 2009. Among the senior al Qaeda leaders killed in the past year were Abu Jihad al-Masri, al Qaeda's intelligence chief; Khalid Habib, number four in al Qaeda and head of its operations in Pakistan; Abu Khabab al-Masri, al Qaeda's most experienced explosives expert, who had experimented with biological and chemical weapons; and Abu Laith al-Libi, the al Qaeda commander in Afghanistan. Some 130 civilians have also been killed, but improved guidance and smaller warheads should lead to fewer unintended casualties from now on. </span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">The logic of this strategy is straightforward</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;In the past, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">you could take out the number 3 al Qaeda leader, and number 4 just moved up to take his place,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; says one official. &quot;Well, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">if you take out number 3, number 4, and then 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, it suddenly becomes a lot more difficult to revive the leadership</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> cadre.&quot; In consequence, &quot;</span><span class="BoldUnderline">the enemy is</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> really, really </span><span class="BoldUnderline">struggling</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; says one senior U.S. counterterrorism official, who notes &quot;</span><span class="BoldUnderline">a significant, significant degradation of al Qaeda command and control in recent months</span><span style="background-color: silver; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; These same officials say that al Qaeda's leadership cadre has been &quot;decimated&quot; and that it is possible to foresee a &quot;complete al Qaeda defeat&quot; in Pakistan. By its third day in office, the Obama administration had decided to press on with this program. Its fiscal year 2010 spending request - which asks for $79.7 million for 792 Hellfire missiles and $489.4 million for 24 Reapers, nearly double the number requested in fiscal year 2009 - points to an increased use of drones. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The </span><span class="BoldUnderline">program has made life so uncertain for militant leaders within 25 miles of the Afghan border that the survivors have relocated deeper into Pakistan</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, to the area around Quetta, in Baluchistan. For the administration, <span style="background-color: silver;">t</span></span><span class="BoldUnderline">he militants' retreat to a safe haven in an area in which the Pakistani government has</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> traditionally </span><span class="BoldUnderline">held sway</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, unlike Waziristan, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">poses a dilemma</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Will the effect of these strikes on Pakistani public opinion outweigh the benefits flowing from further attrition of the militants' leaders</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Thus far, the administration has decided that the benefits are worth the cost.</span><br />

<strong>Dutch withdrawal makes Nato cohesion collapse inevitable</strong><br />
<strong><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lindley-French &amp; Volker 10</span></span></strong> -<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Eisenhower Professor of Defense Strategy at the Netherlands Defense Academy and former US Ambassador to NATO, and Managing Director of the Center for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. (February 26, Julian and Kurt ,“<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.acus.org/new_atlanticist/dutch-afghanistan-exit-game-changer" rel="nofollow">Dutch Afghanistan Exit a Game Changer</a>” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.acus.org/new_atlanticist/dutch-afghanistan-exit-game-changer" rel="nofollow">http://www.acus.org/new_atlanticist/dutch-afghanistan-exit-game-changer</a> </span><br />
<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">Alliance cohesion, fragile at the best of times, will be further undermined at a critical moment. The Dutch are the first NATO ally and European state that has unilaterally signaled its intention to leave. The Canadians could well follow suit</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and leave Kandahar. For most other Europeans, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">this could well prove to be a signal moment. No European has wanted to be the first to quit the struggle.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> However, the commitment of allies such as Germany, Spain and Italy </span><span class="BoldUnderline">has been lukewarm at the best of times and the Dutch departure will doubtless increase pressure on them to leave.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Tragically for the Dutch, all the good work they have undoubtedly done could well be forgotten as they inadvertently trigger a sustained European exodus from Afghanistan. This is unfair not least because the Dutch departure has been triggered by a refusal of allies in more stable regions to send troops south. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ISAF has just created a new joint command which seeks to merge counter-terror (CT) and counterinsurgency (COIN) efforts. This effort is U.S.-led and rightly so because the Americans are investing such a huge effort in what President Obama sees as the critical phase of the campaign in the critical space of the AFPAK region. Had the Dutch stayed until the stated peak of the surge in July 2011 a stronger European presence would not only have helped to underpin the legitimacy of the campaign but also ensured that ISAF represents a merger of European and American efforts, rather than the takeover it will now appear to be. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The departure of the Dutch will doubtless reinforce a belief both in the Afghan Government and key elements of the international community, such as the United Nations and leading non-governmental organizations (NGOs), that only the Americans (and to some extent the British) are reliable partners. This will likely affect the willingness of the Kabul government to work with Europeans and further undermine the influence of Europeans over the government and mission. </span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">The departure of the Dutch will take place just as the EU’s Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) is being inaugurated, further undermining what is a very fragile process towards European security self-determination. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">However, the </span><span class="BoldUnderline">greatest impact will be on NATO and with it the wider transatlantic relationship</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Dutch departure is scheduled for the eve of NATO’s new strategic concept, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">in effect NATO’s ten year plan for dealing with a dangerous and complex world in which stabilization and reconstruction missions will be front and center</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Should the Americans and British be forced to fill the Uruzghan space with little or no help from allies in the north and west of Afghanistan, </span><span class="BoldUnderline">then to the heavily-burdened Americans and British the message will be clear: the solidarity implicit in the strategic concept will be as empty as the Helmand desert</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">On April 3, the leaders of history’s most successful multilateral alliance will gather in Strasbourg, France. </span></span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">NATO confronts an existential crisis in Afghanistan, which has become a test of its utility in the twenty-first century. If it fails there, it risks fading into irrelevance</span></span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Today, fifty-five thousand troops from thirty-eight nations—including twenty-three thousand from the United States—are fighting under NATO’s banner. (Another twenty thousand fall under a separate U.S. command as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.) </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">President Obama will soon announce the results of a two-month strategic review of U.S. Afghan policy. </span></span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The administration will embrace a ramped-up counterinsurgency effort, beginning with seventeen thousand more U.S. troops. The success of this “made in the USA” strategy, however, will require an international unity of effort.</span></span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> Unfortunately, America’s allies remain divided on some fundamental issues. Before the Strasbourg summit, NATO needs to answer the following questions. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Whose war is this? In 2002, German Defense Minister Peter Struck memorably declared that the defense of Germany began in the Hindu Kush. This unity of purpose has since evaporated. Public support for the war is plunging across most NATO countries, and even previously committed nations like Canada and the Netherlands plan to reduce their military presence. Allied governments have placed more than seventy “national caveats” on involvement in combat operations—content, as British Defense Secretary John Hutton has noted, to “freeload” on the U.S. military. The Strasbourg summit must clarify whether this is still NATO’s war—or just America’s. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">What is the end state? President Obama has wisely dialed down the sweeping rhetoric of the Bush administration, which created unrealistic expectations about what the international community could hope to accomplish in Afghanistan. As the president concedes, Afghanistan is unlikely to emerge soon as a prosperous, effective democratic nation. </span></span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">What Obama has not done is to communicate a desired end state there, beyond the minimalist goal of depriving al-Qaeda of a safe haven. Some NATO allies, as well as the United Nations and World Bank, remain committed to long-term state-building as a solution to chronic Afghan insecurity and abysmal governance, but Washington appears to be moving in the opposite direction</span></span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The Strasbourg summit must define a realistic trajectory for the mission through 2020 that the international community can support. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">What is the mission? </span></span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The lack of a clear end state makes it even harder to reach consensus on what NATO’s mission should be, to say nothing of the appropriate division of labor in fulfilling it. Washington’s emerging strategy envisions a robust counterinsurgency campaign to separate the Afghan population from the Taliban, targeted counterterrorist operations against al-Qaeda, and a vigorous counternarcotics effort to cut the taproots of corruption and violence. Few U.S. allies are enthusiastic about these tasks, preferring to focus on traditional peacekeeping and reconstruction. Washington and its partners need to agree on the right balance among these diverse activities—and national responsibilities for carrying them out</span></span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. If Europeans decline to fight, they must be prepared to “surge” on the civilian side, deploying aid and experts to train Afghan security forces and address the country’s glaring governance and economic gaps. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">What is the political process? History—not least the Vietnam experience—suggests that no counterinsurgency strategy can rescue an illegitimate and dysfunctional regime. Insurgencies can only be defeated politically, not militarily. Unfortunately, President Hamid Karzai and the entire Afghan government are increasingly reviled by the population, thanks to the impunity enjoyed by powerful warlords and the corrupting impact of the drug trade. NATO must advance a realistic political strategy to complement its military one. One essential prong in this approach is demanding better Afghan government performance in fighting corruption. Another is supporting Afghan-led negotiations with “moderate” Taliban. NATO allies must speak with one voice on both of these contentious issues. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">What can be done about Pakistan? Finally, NATO must adopt a common approach to Pakistan, where Taliban leaders continue to find sanctuary and fertile ground for recruiting foot soldiers. The Afghan insurgency will only end when Pakistan eliminates the Taliban’s havens, not only in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, but also in Baluchistan. And yet many NATO allies, fearing entanglement in Pakistan’s political troubles, would prefer to treat the International Security Assistance Force mission as a purely Afghan affair. To broaden NATO’s horizons, Washington should champion and seek allied support for a regional approach, one that gives Pakistan assurances of its territorial integrity in return for cracking down on sanctuaries and infiltration. </span></span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">When the cold war ended two decades ago, the alliance was told to go “out of area or out of business.” Like it or not, NATO’s continued relevance depends on whether it can address the challenges of irregular warfare and the dilemmas of failed states. If the alliance rises to the occasion in Afghanistan, it will remain a pillar of U.S. and international security. If it fails to do so, NATO—having gone out of area—may also go out of business</span></span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Few, however, disagree that this will be a long war. <u>There is little hope of a definite conclusion; the best is a trajectory of overall improvement while violence persists. Much depends both on how much and how long aid flows to the Taliban from Pakistan and on development and better governance in Afghanistan. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Regardless of American involvement in Afghanistan</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">it is</span> highly <span style="background-color: yellow;">doubtful</span> that <span style="background-color: yellow;">the Taliban can reclaim Kabul</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">even with</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">continued support</span> of Pashtun fighters from western Pakistan. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Afghanistan does not face trained, regular forces as South Vietnam did in the North Vietnamese Army.</span></u> All the same, <u>significant <span style="background-color: yellow;">American involvement will have to be sustained</span> for many years, not only to accomplish security objectives, but also to aid development of the Afghan south and southeast.</u> That raises the question of American domestic politics—will Americans continue to support massive amounts of aid for Kabul? </span><br />

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Non-Pashtuns and regional actors will prevent it </span></strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 0in;">Those opposing a US/NATO withdrawal assume that this will lead to the Taliban returning to power in Afghanistan, the Taliban allowing al-Qaida renewed access to the country, and al-Qaida making use of Afghanistan to successfully attack the West again. All three of these assumptions, though, are questionable. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">First, </span><u>it is not clear that a US/NATO withdrawal would lead to the Taliban returning to power in much more of Afghanistan than they control now. While <span style="background-color: yellow;">the Taliban</span> have a base of support among the Pashtuns in the south, they appear to <span style="background-color: yellow;">have no support among non-Pashtuns elsewhere</span>. Because of their experience under Taliban rule from 1996 through 2001, the non-Pashtuns have no illusions about what life will be like for them if the Taliban return to power</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This could well motivate them to put aside differences among themselves (which helped the Taliban in 1996) and resist it - something with which the US and NATO could assist even after a complete or partial troop withdrawal. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Further, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">even if the Taliban were to return to power in Afghanistan, it is not clear that it would give al-Qaida carte blanche</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the way it did before 9/11. This after all is what led to the US/NATO intervention in Afghanistan just afterward. </span><u>The Taliban may well prefer to severely circumscribe or even sacrifice al-Qaida in order to avoid the possibility of a second costly interruption to its hold on power.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 0in;">Finally, al-Qaida and its affiliates already have access to Pakistan’s Northwest Frontier Province, Somalia, Yemen and other badlands. It is not clear how al-Qaida’s getting more access to Afghanistan than it now has would materially increase its already considerable ability to attack the West. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Far more than what it might add to al-Qaida’s capabilities, the most important geopolitical impact of a US/NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan would be the perception of a western (read: American) defeat. </span><u>Yet even in the worst case - the Taliban return to power and once again allow carte blanche to al-Qaida - <span style="background-color: yellow;">the most negative geopolitical effects are more likely to be felt</span> not <span style="background-color: yellow;">by</span> the US</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and Europe (which al-Qaida can attack without a base in Afghanistan since it already has bases elsewhere), </span><u>but the <span style="background-color: yellow;">countries</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> neighboring and </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">near Afghanistan</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: the Central Asian republics, Russia, China, India - and perhaps even Pakistan and Iran. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><u>The impact of a US</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">/NATO withdrawal, then, </span><u>could well be to make these neighboring and nearby governments feel more vulnerable, and thus more willing to increase or initiate cooperation with the US and NATO to contain al-Qaida and the Taliban within Afghanistan.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 0in;">This is not to say that the US and NATO will be better off after a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan or a partial one from the south. Withdrawal will surely have some negative consequences. But not withdrawing will also have negative consequences if the US/NATO intervention becomes even less popular in Afghanistan and the West than it is now. </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Even if</span></u> <u>a <span style="background-color: yellow;">withdrawal</span> from Afghanistan <span style="background-color: yellow;">results in the worst case scenario</span> its opponents predict, <span style="background-color: yellow;">this is</span> highly likely to be <span style="background-color: yellow;">mitigated by non-Pashtuns inside Afghanistan or the governments of neighboring and nearby countries acquiring the incentive to increase</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(or in some cases, initiate<span style="background-color: yellow;">) </span></span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">security cooperation</span></u> <u>with the US and NATO <span style="background-color: yellow;">against the</span> common <span style="background-color: yellow;">threat.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Just as maintaining or increasing US/NATO military involvement in Afghanistan will not necessarily lead to victory, withdrawal will not necessarily lead to defeat there. </span></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">This observation sheds light on the nature of the Afghan Taliban, and on the question of what danger they do or do not pose to broader U.S. interests. <span style="background-color: yellow;">The Taliban are a loosely organized resistance concerned above all with society, politics, and power inside Afghanistan. Despite</span> their <span style="background-color: yellow;">ideological affinity</span> to, and proven cooperation with, al-Qa’ida, they are not driven by the transnational objectives associated with bin Ladin and Zawahiri. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Their interest</span> in, and antagonism toward, the United States <span style="background-color: yellow;">is</span> almost <span style="background-color: yellow;">entirely a function of what the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background-color: yellow;">does inside Afghanistan</span> to thwart their aims there.

Their lack of cohesiveness is another of their handicaps. The cause most likely to unite them is resistance to foreign occupation of Afghanistan. <span style="background-color: yellow;">They will tend to be stronger to the extent that our military presence there is seen as an occupation.</span></span></span><br />

<strong>Long war causes war fatigue – strategy shift key.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Barnes, 9</span></span></strong> (Julian E. Barnes – Pentagon correspondent for the LA Times, former senior editor at U.S. News &amp; World Report, AB Harvard University, 7/19,<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/19/nation/na-gates19" rel="nofollow">http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/19/nation/na-gates19</a></span>)<br />
&quot;After the Iraq experience, nobody is prepared to have a long slog where it is not apparent we are making headway,&quot; Gates said in an interview. &quot;The troops are tired; the American people are pretty tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">Deep public unhappiness with the war in Iraq helped sink</span> President George W. <span class="BoldUnderline">Bush's approval ratings</span>, making him the most unpopular president in recent history, according to some surveys. While not predicting a parallel fate for the Obama administration, <span class="BoldUnderline">Gates emphasized the need for progress in Afghanistan</span> during an interview aboard his plane as he returned to Washington after visiting sailors Friday at the Great Lakes Naval Station in Illinois. <span class="BoldUnderline">Gates has spoken about the need for progress in Afghanistan and the public's fatigue of war</span>. But in this interview, he went further by offering a more specific time frame for needed progress as well as the consequences of failing to meet it. <span class="BoldUnderline">Gates has overseen an overhaul in the administration's Afghanistan strategy in recent months, sending 21,000 additional troops and choosing a new commander to lead the international effort. </span>&quot;This is where we are really getting back into the fight,&quot; Gates said. The strategy switch came after extremist attacks rose dramatically last year and U.S. and NATO troop casualties surpassed record levels. A U.S. fighter jet crashed on Saturday, killing the two crew members and bringing the number of Western deaths in Afghanistan to at least 50 in July, the deadliest month yet. President <span class="BoldUnderline">Obama said last week that he hoped to &quot;transition to a different phase</span>&quot; after the Afghan presidential election Aug. 20. During the 2007 buildup of U.S. troops in Iraq, military leaders often mentioned the importance of adding time to &quot;the Washington clock&quot; to give their strategy a chance to work. <br />

<strong>Can’t solve Pakistan with just “commitment” – it’s a political question</strong><br />
<strong><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rubin, 8</span></span></strong> - <span class="bio">director of studies and senior fellow at the Center on International Cooperation at New York University, chair of the Conflict Prevention and Peace Forum of the Social Science Research Council, special adviser to the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan (June 2008, Barnett, “Afghan Dilemmas: Defining Commitments,” The American Interest Online) </span><br />
<br />
The core issue with regard to Afghanistan, however, is not Iran but Pakistan. <span class="BoldUnderline">Lynch </span>accurately diagnoses much of the situation but <span class="BoldUnderline">underestimates the difficulty of changing it</span>. His analysis of Pakistan also leans too far in favor of military factors to the relative neglect of the critical political context. <br />
Lynch is correct that Pakistan’s policy in Afghanistan has had at least two tracks, and that the policy has mainly been determined by the Pakistani military’s security concerns about India. Lynch calls these concerns “paranoid”, as if they might be alleviated through the right combination of medication (more aid and training) and talk therapy (assurances from U.S. diplomats that the Indian elite attitudes toward Pakistan have undergone a sea change). Alas<span class="BoldUnderline">, the malady from which the Pakistani security establishment suffers is endemic worldwide, and it is not amenable to quick courses of treatment. </span>Is it not “paranoid” to build a missile defense system in eastern Europe (that will probably not work) against non-existent Iranian missiles with non-existent nuclear warheads at the cost of relations with Russia? Is it more “paranoid” for Pakistan to be concerned about a nuclear-armed neighbor eight times its size, with which it has a serious territorial dispute and has fought three conventional wars? <br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">The “cure” for the Pakistani military’s self-aggrandizing definition of national security is not U.S. assurances</span> or “insistence” on an end to duplicity. (In a Council on Foreign Relations report, I once proposed that the Administration “should insist on the Pakistani government’s full cooperation in isolating and ending the neo-Taliban insurgency.” CFR President Richard Haass inquired in a marginal comment, “What if we insist and they still don’t do it<span class="BoldUnderline">?”) The Pakistan government will also not readily accept “mediation” of the Durand Line dispute because there is no such dispute, according to the government of Pakistan. </span>There is just a domestic political problem inside Afghanistan that prevents the Afghan state from openly accepting a border it has implicitly recognized many times. <br />
Lynch has correctly identified the problem, but <span class="BoldUnderline">the solution is not greater “commitment”,</span> firmer “insistence” or any other form of interpersonal communication.<span class="BoldUnderline"> The security complex in South Asia can only be transformed by political change, </span>the centerpiece of which must be the democratization of Pakistan, to include civilian control of its national security strategy<span class="BoldUnderline">. The Pakistani military will not consent to a stable Afghanistan under U.S. hegemony because it fears that the U<span style="text-decoration: none;">nited </span>S<span style="text-decoration: none;">tates</span> will reduce military aid to Pakistan the moment it no longer needs Pakistan to address terrorism or instability in Afghanistan. </span>The Pakistani military cannot agree to a definition of Pakistani national security that is not based on the Indian threat, because that threat, in addition to being founded on the reality of Indian capabilities, provides the rationale for the military’s domination of Pakistan’s state, society and economy.<br />

<strong>COIN will inevitable fail – insurgency exists because we are there and empirics are on our side – assumes all your CP good warrants</strong><br />
<strong><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">Gady, 11</span></span></strong> (Franz-Stefan, Foreign Policy and Defense Analyst at the EastWest Institute, “<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/franzstefan-gady/they-are-fighting-because_b_808323.html" rel="nofollow">They Are Fighting Because We &quot;Are Down There&quot;</a>,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/franzstefan-gady/they-are-fighting-because_b_808323.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/franzstefan-gady/they-are-fighting-because_b_808323.html</a></span> 1/14/2011) <br />
<br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">Simple truths are often overlooked in military conflict</span>. <br />
In 1862, during the early stages of the U.S. Civil War, a group of federal soldiers closed in on a young, undernourished, ragtag Confederate somewhere in Tennessee. Since he clearly owned no slaves, and did not care about the Union or cotton tariffs, he bewildered the Northern soldiers with his willingness to sacrifice his life for matters ostensibly beyond his little universe. After capturing him, the Northerners posed the question, &quot;<span class="BoldUnderline">Why are you fighting</span> anyhow?&quot; to which he replied, <span class="BoldUnderline">&quot;I am fighting because you are down here!&quot;</span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">This simple statement is essential in understanding people's willingness to lay down their lives and pick up weapons to fight Western forces in</span> both Iraq and <span class="BoldUnderline">Afghanistan</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">Rather than being motivated by religion, ideologies, or other forms of indoctrination, most people fight when they see their way of life, their property, and the sanctuary of their homes threatened</span> -- a point <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amazon.com/Accidental-Guerrilla-Fighting-Small-Midst/dp/0195368347/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1294877872&amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">well argued</a></span> in David Kilcullen's book <em>The Accidental Guerilla</em>. In it, he states that <span class="BoldUnderline">the West's interventions created &quot;the accidental guerilla&quot;, a person who fights for the simple reason that we are intruding in his daily life: </span><br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">Our too-willing and heavy-handed interventions in the</span> so-called &quot;<span class="BoldUnderline">war on terrorism&quot; to date have</span> largely <span class="BoldUnderline">played into the hands of this</span> AQ [<span class="BoldUnderline">Al Qaeda] exhaustion strategy</span>, <span class="BoldUnderline">while creating tens of thousands of accidental guerrillas and tying us down in a costly (and</span> potentially <span class="BoldUnderline">unsustainable) series of interventions</span>. <br />
The sober conclusion is that <span class="BoldUnderline">if resistance to the occupiers is provoked by the West's sheer presence, any attempt to influence insurgents with a &quot;heart-and-mind campaign&quot; can only achieve partial results because the root cause of the problem</span> -- i.e. <span class="BoldUnderline">the foreign military presence -- is not addressed</span>. <br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">The few successful cases of counterinsurgency</span>, such as <span class="BoldUnderline">the Malayan Emergency or &quot;The Troubles&quot; in Ireland in</span> 19<span class="BoldUnderline">82</span>, <span class="BoldUnderline">are isolated incidents of successful campaigns with external events often superseding any co</span>unter<span class="BoldUnderline">in</span>surgency <span class="BoldUnderline">strategy</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">In </span>the case of <span class="BoldUnderline">Malaya</span>, where <span class="BoldUnderline">the insurgents were an ethnic minority</span> (mostly Chinese), the <span class="BoldUnderline">British promised Malaya independence, and during the insurgency, the Korean War caused an export boom in rubber making, which resulted in the average Malayan being better suited economically than before the campaign. In</span> Northern <span class="BoldUnderline">Ireland, violence still continues on a sporadic basis, but a political settlement has been reached by the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain only sixteen years after the</span> allegedly successful <span class="BoldUnderline">counterinsurgency campaign.</span><br />
David Kilcullen's thesis is <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amazon.com/Cutting-Fuse-Explosion-Suicide-Terrorism/dp/0226645606" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">supported</a></span> by Professor Robert A. Pape's book, <em>Cutting the Fuse: The Explosion of Global Suicide Terrorism and How to Stop It</em> published in October 2010. In it he makes a compelling argument by stating that <span class="BoldUnderline">military occupations rather than Islamic fundamentalist teaching caused the spike in suicide attacks</span>. He states that: <br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">Each month, there are more suicide terrorists trying to kill Americans and their allies in Afghanistan</span>, Iraq, and other Muslim countries <span class="BoldUnderline">than in all the years before 2001</span> combined. <span class="BoldUnderline">From 1980 to 2003, there were 343 suicide attacks around the world, and at most 10 percent were anti-American inspired. Since 2004, there have been more than 2,000, over 91 percent against U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan</span>, Iraq, and other countries. <br />
To counter this, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Pape argues for a strategy of &quot;offshore balancing,&quot; rather than counterinsurgency , extracting US forces from</span></span> the Middle East and <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Afghanistan and readying small, available, deployable expeditionary forces that can intervene on short notice, topple regimes, and hunt terrorists detrimental to Western interests</span></span>. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The heyday of &quot;offshore balancing&quot; was the 19th century gunboat diplomacy, but</span></span> Pape includes <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan as a successful offshore balancing act until it was transformed into a nation-building exercise</span></span>. <br />
There are still various policy makers and military brass that think countries have a breaking point, and if enough force is applied, insurgents submit. <span class="BoldUnderline">During</span> the <span class="BoldUnderline">Vietnam</span> War, Henry <span class="BoldUnderline">Kissinger insisted that &quot;a fourth-rate power like North Vietnam must have a breaking point&quot; and advocated an increase in bombing raids on North Vietnam. This</span> &quot;gloves off&quot; <span class="BoldUnderline">approach has been practiced</span> in the past <span class="BoldUnderline">by German forces in both the First and Second World War in Eastern Europe, by the French in Algeria and Indochina and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan</span> to name a few. The <span class="BoldUnderline">success was minimal and caused the civilian population to turn towards the guerillas</span>. In the end, <span class="BoldUnderline"><strong>all</strong> </span>of the above-mentioned <span class="BoldUnderline"><strong>examples ended in defeat for the occupying power</strong></span><strong>.</strong><br />
The idea of a breaking point stems from the 18th and19th century pseudo-scientific study of war, heavily influenced by the Age of Enlightenment, of which Carl von Clausewitz's work On War is the most prominent example. In the often-quoted Clausewitzean universe, defeating the enemy in a decisive engagement or with a series of &quot;Hammerschlaege&quot; (hammer blows) thus breaking his will to resist will bring victory. What few people know, however, is that Clausewitz warned that <span class="BoldUnderline">if the enemy's</span> &quot;Schwergewicht&quot; (<span class="BoldUnderline">center of gravity</span>) -- <span class="BoldUnderline">both political and military -- cannot be located or fully destroyed, the result could be a</span> &quot;formenloser Krieg&quot; (a <span class="BoldUnderline">formless war</span>), <span class="BoldUnderline">a conflict without acknowledged enemies and stated war-aims</span>. When writing this, Clausewitz referenced the devastating effects and carnage of the 30 Years War (1618-1648), which depopulated large sections of Central Europe. The War was primarily fought by bands of private mercenaries plundering the Central European countryside with little political control or military strategic leadership. Battles were sporadic and indecisive. <br />
<span class="BoldUnderline">For the ongoing war</span>s <span class="BoldUnderline">in Afghanistan</span> and Iraq, <span class="BoldUnderline">the logical conclusion has to be that winning over the local population amidst an insurgency will be all but impossible</span>. <span class="BoldUnderline">They are fighting because we are down there! The increase in civilian casualties due to drone strikes and the raised Western troop presence only will increase the chances that more people will pick up arms against Western forces. The resolution of the conflict therefore cannot be found on the military front</span> but rather has to be political. <br />

<strong>Just the application of counterinsurgency doctrine in Afghanistan will overstretch the military</strong><br />
<strong><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dorronsoro, 10</span></span></strong>- Visiting Scholar @ Carnegie (Gilles, “The Case for Negotiations,” May 24th, Carnegie, <span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:7113:http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=40863 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=40863" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=40863</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:7113 --></span>)<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">The coalition's strategy in Afghanistan is at an impasse</span>.</span> The <span class="BoldUnderline">renewed efforts</span> undertaken since the summer of 2009 <span class="BoldUnderline">have failed to temper the guerrilla war.</span> A few tactical successes are possible, but <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">this war cannot be won. The coalition cannot defeat the Taliban as long as Pakistan continues to offer them sanctuary</span></span>. And increasing resources to wage the war is not an option. <span class="BoldUnderline">The costs of continuing the war--</span>to use Ambassador Karl Eikenberry's expression in the leaked telegram to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton--<span class="BoldUnderline">are &quot;astronomical.&quot;</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">The entire U.S. strategy revolves around a swift Afghanization of the conflict, yet <span class="BoldUnderline">the coalition's Afghan partner is weaker than it was a year ago. The state's presence in the provinces has declined sharply and the legitimacy of </span>President Hamid <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Karzai's government is contested</span>.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">As a result of the massive fraud in the August 2009 presidential elections, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">the government has no popular legitimacy</span></span>, and <span class="BoldUnderline">the legislative elections slated</span> for fall 2010 <span class="BoldUnderline">will probably undermine the political system even further because fraud is inevitable. It is unlikely that the Afghan regime will ever be able to assume responsibility for its own security.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">As a result<span style="background-color: yellow;">,<span class="BoldUnderline"> the coalition faces an endless war</span></span> accompanied by an intolerable loss of life and treasure. A less costly alternative would be to negotiate a broad agreement with the Taliban leadership to form a national unity government, with guarantees against al Qaeda's return to Afghanistan. But even if such negotiations might occur, they hold no guarantee of success.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Yet the cost of their failure is negligible compared with the potential gain: a relatively swift way out of the crisis that preserves the coalition's essential interests. Time is not on the coalition's side. The United States should contact Taliban leaders as soon as possible rather than waiting for the situation to deteriorate further.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">In pursuit of a losing strategy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">The Taliban cannot be defeated militarily because the border with Pakistan is and will remain open for the insurgents</span>. The Pakistani army</span>, which <span class="BoldUnderline">refuses to launch an offensive against the</span> Afghan <span class="BoldUnderline">Taliban,</span> has never considered taking action against the Taliban leadership based in Pakistan. The February arrest of acting Taliban military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is probably a sign that the Pakistani military wants more control over the insurgency to prepare for the negotiation process.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">What's more, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">the insurgency is now nationwide and cannot be contained by counterinsurgency (COIN) operations</span></span> in two or three southern provinces. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">The COIN strategy cannot succeed because of the immense resources it requires</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> In a marginal, strategically unimportant district such as Marjah, the coalition would have to keep thousands of troops for years to prevent the Taliban's return<span style="background-color: yellow;">. <span class="BoldUnderline">To replicate such strategy, even in one province, would overstretch the U.S. military</span></span><span class="BoldUnderline">.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In Afghanistan today, the United States and its allies are using the wrong means to vigorously pursue the wrong mission. </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Persisting on the present course</span>—</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">as both John McCain and Barack Obama have promised to do—</span><span class="BoldUnderline">will turn Operation Enduring Freedom into Operation Enduring Obligation<span style="background-color: yellow;">. Afghanistan will become a sinkhole consuming resources neither the U.S. military nor the U.S. government can afford to was</span>te</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (Story continued below...)</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 0in;">The allied campaign in Afghanistan is now entering its eighth year. The operation was launched with expectations of a quick, decisive victory but has failed to accomplish that objective. Granted, the diversion of resources to the misguided war in Iraq has forced commanders in Afghanistan to make do with less. Yet that doesn't explain the lack of progress. The real problem is that Washington has misunderstood the nature of the challengeAfghanistan poses and misread America's interests there.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 0in;">One of history's enduring lessons is that Afghans don't appreciate it when outsiders tell them how to govern their affairs—just ask the British or the <span class="Underline">Soviets. U.S. success in overthrowing the Taliban seemed to suggest this lesson no longer applied, at least to Americans. That quickly proved an illusion.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 0in;">In Iraq, toppling the old order was easy. Installing a new one to take its place has turned out to be infinitely harder.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yet the </span><span class="BoldUnderline">challenges of pacifying Afghanistan dwarf those posed by Iraq. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Afghanistan is a much bigger country—nearly the size of Texas</span>—and has a larger population that's just as fractious</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, unlike Iraq, Afghanistan possesses almost none of the prerequisites of modernity; its literacy rate, for example, is 28 percent, barely a third of Iraq's. In terms of effectiveness and legitimacy, the government in Kabul lags well behind Baghdad—not exactly a lofty standard. Apart from opium, Afghans produce almost nothing the world wants. While liberating Iraq may have seriously reduced the reservoir of U.S. power, fixing Afghanistan would drain it altogether.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Meanwhile, the chief effect of allied military operations there so far has been not to defeat the radical Islamists but to push them across the Pakistani border. As a result, </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">efforts to stabilize Afghanistan are contributing to the destabilization of Pakistan</span>, with potentially devastating implications</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. September's bombing of the Marriott hotel in Islamabad suggests that the extremists are growing emboldened. Today and for the foreseeable future,</span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">no country poses a greater potential threat to U.S. national security than does Pakistan</span>. <span style="background-color: yellow;">To risk the stability of that nuclear-armed state in the vain hope of salvaging Afghan-istan would be a terrible mistake</span>.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">All this means that </span><span class="BoldUnderline">the proper U<span style="background-color: yellow;">.S. priority for Afghanistan should be not to try harder but to change course. The war in Afghanistan</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (like the Iraq War) </span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">won't be won militarily</span>. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It can be settled—however imperfectly—only through politics.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="BoldUnderline">The new U.S. president needs to realize that America's real political objective in Afghanistan is actually quite modest: to ensure that terrorist groups like Al Qaeda can't use it as a safe haven for launching attacks against the West.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Accomplishing that won't require creating a modern, cohesive nation-state. U.S. officials tend to assume that power in Afghanistan ought to be exercised from Kabul. Yet the real influence in Afghanistan has traditionally rested with tribal leaders and warlords. Rather than challenge that tradition, Washington should work with it. </span><span class="BoldUnderline">Offered the right incentives, warlords can accomplish U.S. objectives more effectively and more cheaply than Western combat battalions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The basis of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan should therefore become decentralization and outsourcing, offering cash and other emoluments to local leaders who will collaborate with the United States in excluding terrorists from their territory.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 0in;">This doesn't mean Washington should blindly trust that warlords will become America's loyal partners. U.S. intelligence agencies should continue to watch Afghanistan closely, and the Pentagon should crush any jihadist activities that local powers fail to stop themselves. As with the Israelis in Gaza, periodic airstrikes may well be required to pre-empt brewing plots before they mature.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 0in;">Were U.S. resources unlimited and U.S. interests in Afghanistan more important, upping the ante with additional combat forces might make sense. But U.S. power—especially military power—is quite limited these days, and U.S. priorities lie elsewhere.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Rather than committing more troops<span style="background-color: yellow;">, </span></span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">therefore, the new president should withdraw them while devising a more realistic—and more affordable—strategy for Afghanistan</span>.</span></span><br />

It would also consign some Afghans, particularly women, to oppression and human-rights violations at the hands of the Taliban. <span class="DebateUnderline">But <span style="background-color: yellow;">US failure to execute an ambitious counter-insurgency and state-building policy runs a prohibitive risk of playing into al-Qaeda's hands</span>. Among the most cherished aspects of al-Qaeda's strategy is the 'management of savagery'</span>, which constitutes the title of an important jihadist manual - subtitled 'the most important stage through which the umma will pass' - propagated under the pseudonym 'Abu Bakr al-Naji' via the Internet beginning in 2004. In essence, <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">the strategy calls for a war of attrition in which Muslims bleed</span> and gradually enervate <span style="background-color: yellow;">the United States and its allies by repeatedly drawing them into military conflict</span>.</span>27 Such designs raise the question of whether the United States, having intervened full-bloodedly in Afghanistan, will likewise occupy and attempt to reshape every underdeveloped country in which jihadists establish a presence. This sort of project would surely be impracticable. Yet given al-Qaeda's transnational cast and noted adaptability, jihadists under its influence will almost inevitably rise to political prominence elsewhere. In this light, it is unclear where US-led intervention might end, and how Washington could carry the burden of the Afghanistan precedent. Finally, <span class="DebateUnderline">within the operational environment of Afghanistan </span>and Pakistan themselves, <span class="DebateUnderline">the <span style="background-color: yellow;">alternative to a minimalist approach is likely to be not the controlled and purposeful escalation</span> </span>envisaged by the current policy <span class="DebateUnderline">but rather a pernicious spiral with an indeterminate outcome. <span style="background-color: yellow;">If the U</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow;">nited </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow;">tates </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">continues to respond to the threat of al-Qaeda by deepening intervention in Afghanistan and Pakistan</span>, al-Qaeda and the Taliban <span style="background-color: yellow;">will rejoin with heightened terrorist and insurgent operations that bring further instability</span></span>. Indeed, that appears to be happening. In August 2009, as US ground commanders requested more troops, Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on CNN described the situation in Afghanistan as 'serious and deteriorating' and the Taliban as having 'gotten better, more sophisticated, in their tactics'.28 <span class="DebateUnderline">The United States' next logical move</span> would be <span class="DebateUnderline">to intensify pressure, raising civilian casualties</span>, increasing political pressure on the Kabul and Islamabad regimes, and ultimately weakening them, which <span class="DebateUnderline">would only help al-Qaeda and the Taliban</span>. In fact, some evidence of this dynamic has already materialised, as the Pakistani government has faced difficulties in dealing with hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis displaced by the military campaign, undertaken at Washington's behest, in the Swat Valley. Certainly worries about Islamabad's ability to handle the Taliban on its own are justi fied. Some Taliban members are no doubt keen on regime change in favour of jihadists, as noted by Bruce Riedel, who headed up the Obama administration's 60-day policy review.29 But Pakistan's military capabilities should not be given short shrift. The Pakistani army, however preoccupied by India, is seasoned and capable, and able to respond decisively to the Taliban should its activities reach a critical level of destabilisation. Inter-Services Intelligence, devious though it may be, would be loath to allow the transfer of nuclear weapons to the Taliban. Moving forward <span class="DebateUnderline">Al-Qaeda's attrition strategy has a political as well as an operational dynamic: if the United States and its allies are continually goaded into drawing Muslim blood, more Muslims will be antagonised and therefore become ripe for recruitment</span>. American strategist Jeffrey Record, a professor at the US Air War College, has argued that barbarism in waging war makes it difficult, if not impossible, for a democracy like the United States to keep its democratic credentials intact, and thus is hardwired to fail. Citing the French experience in Algeria and both the French and the American campaigns in Vietnam, Record notes that 'the stronger side's vulnerability to defeat in protracted conflicts against irregular foes is arguably heightened if it is a democracy'. This is because citizens of democracies tend to find military escalation - encompassing higher casualties, rising brutality and the near-inevitable erosion of democratic practices - increasingly intolerable and often reach their limit before victory <span style="font-size: 7pt;">can be secured.30 It follows that the most difficult challenge to sustaining a maximalist US policy, leaving aside substantive questions of strategy, is that of keeping the American people on board. The US government can sustain a deployment of some 75,000 troops, the funding it requires, and the public's tolerance for steady casualties for only a finite - and dwindling - period. If the US deployment in Iraq were reduced by two-thirds over the next year, the US presence in Iraq and Afghanistan would still be about 125,000. To support that number, US military practices would require a force twice as large to be perpetually either preparing to deploy or recovering from deployment. That would mean one half of US ground forces would be indefinitely committed to Iraq and Afghanistan, while Afghanistan becomes the largest recipient of US foreign aid. An effort on that scale would</span> garner majority US domestic support only if the public sees likely victory and Congress, the White House and the Beltway punditry line up decisively behind the policy. The emerging trends are pointing in the contrary direction. As monthly and annual US casualties in Afghanistan reached historical peaks in August 2009, and the Afghan national election loomed, a poll conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post indicated that most Americans did not support an extended US military commitment in Afghanistan.31 Congressional Democrats are balking at anticipated requests for more troops.32 And even conservative columnists, like the influential George F. Will, have turned against a maximalist Afghanistan policy.33 <span class="DebateUnderline">Overall, increasingly strong perceptions of the Karzai government as inept and corrupt are making prospects that the United States could enlist it as an effective counter-insurgency partner and lend it the legitimacy required to rebuild the country seem more and more baseless</span>. The upshot is that <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">only if the United States establishes a well-calibrated limited policy now will it have the political flexibility to sustain it over the longer-term and thereby to effectively contain the jihadist threat</span> in Central Asia</span>. If, on the other hand, the Obama administration promises more than it can deliver in Afghanistan, a reprise of Vietnam may occur: once failure becomes clear, domestic support will evaporate, the administration will be compelled to withdraw precipitously, and the United States will lose considerable traction in the region. <span class="DebateUnderline">These factors suggest that the United States should limit its Afghanistan/Pakistan policy to counter-terrorism and disown country-wide counterinsurgency and state-building in Afghanistan</span>. At the same time, Washington must remain highly sensitive to the dynamic whereby decreased military activity in Afghanistan combined with robust operations in Pakistan could induce al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan and render it a main threat once again. In that light, any abrupt wholesale American military withdrawal from Afghanistan would be too risky. Instead, <span class="DebateUnderline">the United States should seek to facilitate a glide-path to a substantial drawdown - and with it fewer casualties and lower expenditures in Afghanistan - </span>over the next few years.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">(“On Constitution and Causation in International Relations,” British International Studies Association) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">As a community, we in the academic study of international politics spend too much time worrying about the kind of issues addressed in this essay. <u>The</u> </span><u>central point</u> <u>of IR scholarship is to increase our knowledge of how the world works, not to worry about how</u> (or whether) <u>we can know how the world works</u>. What matters for IR is ontology, not epistemology. This doesn’t mean that there are no interesting epistemological questions in IR, and even less does it mean that there are no important political or sociological aspects to those questions. Indeed there are, as I have suggested above, and as a discipline IR should have more awareness of these aspects. At the same time, however, these are questions best addressed by philosophers and sociologists of knowledge, not political scientists. <u>Let’s face it: most IR scholars</u>, including this one, <u>have little or no proper training in epistemology</u>, <u>and</u> as such <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">the attempt to solve epistemological problems</span></u> anyway <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">will </span></u><u><span style="background-color: aqua;">inevitably lead to confusion</span></u> (after all, <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">after 2000 years, even</span></u> <u>the</u> <span style="background-color: aqua;"><u>specialists are still having a hard time</u></span> ). Moreover, <u>as long as we let our research be driven in an</u> <u>open-minded fashion by substantive questions and problems rather than by epistemologies and methods, there is little need to answer epistemological questions</u> either. <u>It is simply not the case that we have to undertake an epistemological analysis of how we can know something before we can know it, a fact amply attested to by the success of the natural sciences, whose practitioners are only rarely forced by the results of their inquiries to consider epistemological questions. <span style="background-color: aqua;">In important respects we do know how international politics works, and it doesn’t much matter how we came to that knowledge</span></u>. In that light, <u>going into the epistemology business will distract us from the real business of IR, which is international politics.</u> <u>Our great <span style="background-color: aqua;">debates should be about </span>first-order issues of <span style="background-color: aqua;">substance</span></u>, like the ‘first debate’ between Realists and Idealists, <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">not</span> second-order issues of <span style="background-color: aqua;">method</span></u>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Unfortunately, it is no longer a simple matter for IR scholars to ‘just say no’ to <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">epistemological discourse</span></u>. The problem is that this discourse <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">has</span></u> already <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">contamin- ated our thinking </span>about international politics, <span style="background-color: aqua;">helping to polarize the discipline into ‘</span></u></span><u>paradigm wars’</u> . Although the resurgence of these wars in the 1980s and 90s is due in large part to the rise of post-positivism, its roots lie in the epistemological anxiety of positivists, who since the 1950s have been very concerned to establish the authority of their work as Science. This is an important goal, one that I share, but its implementation has been marred by an overly narrow conception of science as being concerned only with causal questions that can be answered using the methods of natural science. The effect has been to marginalize historical and interpretive work that does not fit this mould, and to encourage scholars interested in that kind of work to see themselves as somehow not engaged in science. One has to wonder whether the two sides should be happy with the result. Do positivists really mean to suggest that it is not part of science to ask questions about how things are constituted, questions which if those things happen to be made of ideas might only be answerable by interpretive methods? If so, then they seem to be saying that the double-helix model of DNA, and perhaps much of rational choice theory, is not science. And <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">do post-positivists</span> really</u> mean to <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">suggest that students</span></u> of social life <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">should not ask causal questions or</span></u> attempt to <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">test their claims</span> against empirical evidence? <span style="background-color: aqua;">If so, then it is </span></u><u>not clear by what criteria their work should be judged</u><u>, or how it differs from art or revelation</u> . On both sides, in other words, the result of <u>the</u> Third Debate’s <u>sparring over epistemology is often one-sided, intolerant caricatures</u> <u>of science.</u><br />

<strong>Critique fails – no practical method for change</strong><br />
Richard Wyn <strong><span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jones</span></span></strong>, Professor International Politics – Aberystwyth University, <span class="AuthorDate"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">‘<strong>99</strong></span></span><br />

<br />
Because emancipatory political practice is central to the claims of <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">critical theory</span></u>, one might expect that proponents of a critical approach to the study of international relations would be reflexive about the relationship between theory and practice. Yet their thinking on this issue thus far <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">does not seem to have progressed much beyond grandiose statements of intent</span></u>. <u>There have been no systematic considerations of how critical international theory can help generate, support, or sustain emancipatory politics beyond the seminar room or conference hotel</u>.<br />
Robert <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">Cox</span></u>, for example, <u>has described the task of critical theorists as providing “a guide to strategic action for bringing about an alternative order”</u> (R. Cox 1981: 130). <u>Although he has also gone on to identify possible agents for change and has outlined the nature and structure of some feasible alternative orders, he <span style="background-color: aqua;">has not explicitly indicated whom he regards as the addressee of critical theory</span></u> (i.e., <u>who is being guided</u>) <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">and</span> thus <span style="background-color: aqua;">how the theory can</span> hope to <span style="background-color: aqua;">become a part of the political process</span></u> (see R. Cox 1981, 1983, 1996).<br />
Similarly, Andrew Linklater has argued that “a critical theory of international relations must regard the practical project of extending community beyond the nation–state as its most important problem” (Linklater 1990b: 171). However, he has little to say about the role of theory in the realization of this “practical project.” Indeed, his main point is to suggest that the role of critical theory “is not to offer instructions on how to act but to reveal the existence of unrealised possibilities” (Linklater 1990b: 172). But the question still remains, reveal to whom? Is the audience enlightened politicians? Particular social classes? Particular social movements? Or particular (and presumably particularized) communities? In light of Linklater’s primary concern with emancipation, one might expect more guidance as to whom he believes might do the emancipating and how critical theory can impinge upon the emancipatory process.<br />
There is, likewise, little enlightenment to be gleaned from Mark Hoffman’s otherwise important contribution. He argues that critical international theory<br />
seeks not simply to reproduce society via description, but to understand society and change it. It is both descriptive and constructive in its theoretical intent: it is both an intellectual and a social act. It is not merely an expression of the concrete realities of the historical situation, but also a force for change within those conditions. (M. Hoffman 1987: 233)<br />
Despite this very ambitious declaration, once again, <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">Hoffman gives no suggestion as to how this “force for change” should be operationalized and what </span></u><u>concrete role</u> <u>critical theorizing might play in changing society.</u><br />
Thus, <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">although the</span> critical international theorists’ <span style="background-color: aqua;">critique</span> of</u> the role that more <u>conventional approaches to</u> the study of <u>world politics</u> play in reproducing the contemporary world order <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">may be persuasive</span>, their account of <span style="background-color: aqua;">the relationship between their</span> own <span style="background-color: aqua;">work and emancipatory political practice is </span></u><u>unconvincing</u> . Given the centrality of practice to the claims of critical theory, <u>this is a very significant weakness. <span style="background-color: aqua;">Without some plausible account of the mechanisms</span> by which they hope to aid in the achievement of their emancipatory goals, proponents of critical international theory are hardly in a position to justify the assertion that “it represents the next stage in the development of I</u>nternational <u>R</u>elations <u>theory</u>” (M. Hoffman 1987: 244). Indeed, <u>without a more convincing conceptualization of the theory–practice nexus</u>, one can argue that <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">critical international theory</span></u>, <u>by its own terms</u>, <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">has </span></u><u>no way of redeeming</u> some of <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">its central</span></u> <u>epistemological and</u> <span style="background-color: aqua;"><u>methodological claims</u></span><u><span style="background-color: aqua;"> and</span></u> thus that it <u><span style="background-color: aqua;">is a </span></u><u>fatally flawed enterprise</u> <span style="background-color: aqua;">.</span><br />
<u>The provision of such an account is therefore necessary for all critical theorists working on the study of world politics</u>, <u>including</u>, of course, <u>those engaged in the development of critical security studies</u>. However, <u>it is a task made more difficult not only by the unconvincing accounts of the theory–practice nexus</u> offered by the leading lights in the Frankfurt School tradition <u>but also by the breadth of the issues raised when the theory–practice question is broached. To trace the relationship between theory and practice is to address the nature and social role of intellectuals and intellectual activity. It is also to question the role that intellectuals play in supporting and promoting social change</u>. In turn, <u>this raises the thorny issue of the audience to which critical intellectuals are addressing their ideas</u>. Ultimately, of course, <u>all of this leads inexorably to one of the central, perennial issues of social theory: the relationship between agents and structures.</u><br />

For critical theorists, <span class="BoldUnderline">the key to achieving <span style="background-color: gray;">a “postmodern international system”</span> is to alter state identity radically</span>, or more specifically, <span class="BoldUnderline">to transform how states think about themselves</span> and their relationship with other states.

<span style="font-size: 11px;">A. Discourse of danger. The aff’s construction of threats rigs debate into how best to secure the Self from the Other.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> David Grondin, Masters in Political Science &amp; Ph.D. Candidate – University of Ottawa, ‘4</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> (“(Re)Writing the ‘National Security State,’ Center for United States Studies)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Approaches that deconstruct theoretical practices in order to disclose what is hidden in the use of concepts such as “national security” have something valuable to say. Their more reflexive and critically-inclined view illustrates how terms used in realist discourses, such as state, anarchy, world order, revolution in military affairs, and security dilemmas, are produced by a specific historical, geographical and socio-political context as well as historical forces and social relations of power (Klein, 1994: 22). Since realist analysts do not question their ontology and yet purport to provide a neutral and objective analysis of a given world order based on military power and interactions between the most important political units, namely states, realist discourses constitute a political act in defense of the state. Indeed, “[…] it is important to recognize that to employ a textualizing approach to social policy involving conflict and war is not to attempt to reduce social phenomena to various concrete manifestations of language. Rather, it is an attempt to analyze the interpretations governing policy thinking. And it is important to recognize that policy thinking is not unsituated” (Shapiro, 1989a: 71). Policy thinking is practical thinking since it imposes an analytic order onthe “real world”, a world that only exists in the analysts’ own narratives. In this light, Barry Posen’s political role in legitimizing American hegemonic power and national security conduct seems obvious:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> U.S. command of the commons provides an impressive foundation for selective engagement. It is not adequate for a policy of primacy. […] Command of the commons gives the United States a tremendous capability to harm others. Marrying that capability to a conservative policy of selective engagement helps make U.S. military power appear less threatening and more tolerable. Command of the commons creates additional collective goods for U.S. allies. These collective goods help connect U.S. military power to seemingly prosaic welfare concerns. U.S. military power underwrites world trade, travel, global telecommunications, and commercial remote sensing, which all depend on peace and order in the commons” (Posen, 2003: 44 and 46).</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Adopting a more critical stance, David Campbell points out that “[d]anger is not an objective condition. It (sic) is not a thing which exists independently of those to whom it may become a threat. […] Nothing is a risk in itself; [...] it all depends on how one analyses the danger, considers the event” (Campbell, 1998: 1-2). In the same vein, national security discourse does not evaluateobjective threats; rather, it is itself a product of historical processes and structures in the state and society that produces it.Whoever has the power to define security is then the one who has the authority to write legitimate security discourses and conduct the policies that legitimize them. The realistanalysts and state leaders who invoke national security and act in its name are the same individuals who hold the power to securitize threats by inserting them in a discourse that frames national identity and freezes it.9</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Like many concepts, realism is essentially contested. In a critical reinterpretation of realism, James Der Derian offers a genealogy of realism that deconstructs the uniform realism represented in IR: he reveals many other versions of realism that are never mentioned in International Relations texts (Der Derian, 1995: 367). I am aware that there are many realist discourses in International Relations, but they all share a set of assumptions, such as “the state is a rational unitary actor”, “the state is the main actor in international relations”, “states pursue power defined as a national interest”, and so on. I want to show that realism is one way of representing reality, not the reflection of reality. While my aim here is not to rehearse Der Derian’s genealogy of realism, I do want to spell out the problems with a positivist theory of realism and a correspondence philosophy of language. Such a philosophy accepts nominalism, wherein language as neutral description corresponds to reality. This is precisely the problem of epistemic realism and of the realism characteristic of American realist theoretical discourses. And since for poststructuralists language constitutes reality, a reinterpretation of realism as constructed in these discourses is called for.10 These scholars cannot refer to the “essentially contested nature of realism” and then use “realism as the best language to reflect a self-same phenomenon” (Der Derian, 1995: 374). Let me be clear: I am not suggesting that the many neorealist and neoclassical realist discourses in International Relations are not useful. Rather, I want to argue that these technicist and scientist forms of realism serve political purposes, used as they are in many think tanks and foreign policy bureaucracies to inform American political leaders. This is the relevance of deconstructing the uniform realism (as used in International Relations): it brings to light its locatedness in a hermeneutic circle in which it is unwittingly trapped (Der Derian, 1995: 371). And as Friedrich Kratochwil argues, “[…] the rejection of a correspondence theory of truth does not condemn us, as it is often maintained, to mere ‘relativism’ and/or to endless “deconstruction” in which anything goes but it leaves us with criteria that allows us to distinguish and evaluate competing theoretical creations” (Kratochwil, 2000 : 52).</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Given that political language is not a neutral medium that gives expression to ideas formed independently of structures of signification that sustain political action and thought, American realist discourses belonging to the neorealist or neoclassical realist traditions cannot be taken as mere descriptions of reality. We are trapped in the production of discourses in which national leaders and security speech acts emanating from realist discourses develop and reinforce a notion of national identity as synonymous with national security. U.S. national security conduct should thus be understood through the prism of the theoretical discourses of</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> American political leaders and realist scholars that co-constitute it. Realist discourses depict American political leaders acting in defense of national security, and political leaders act in the name of national security. In the end, what distinguishes realist discourses is that they depict the United States as having behaved like a national security state since World War II, while legitimating the idea that the United States should continue to do so. Political scientists and historians “are engaged in making (poesis), not merely recording or reporting” (Medhurst, 2000: 17). Precisely in this sense, rhetoric is not the description of national security conduct; it constitutes it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Writing the National Security State</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> [F]rom the giddy days of the first and through the most morbid moments of the Second Cold War, the popular culture, journalism, and academic study of international intrigue has been an important intertext of power and play in world politics. This intertext represents a field of ideological contestation where national security strategies, with their endgames of impossibly real wars of mass annihilation can be played and replayed for mass consumption as a simulation of war in which states compete, interests clash, and spy counters spy, all in significant fun (Der Derian, 1992: 41).</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> It is difficult to trace the exact origins of the concept of “national security”. It seems however that its currency in policymaking circles corresponds to the American experience of the Second World War and of the early years of what came to be known as the “Cold War”. In this light, it is fair to say that the meaning of the American national security state is bound up with the Cold War context.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> If one is engaged in deciphering the meaning of the Cold War prism for American leaders, what matters is not uncovering the “reality” of the Cold War as such, but how, it conferred meaning and led people to act upon it as “reality”. The Cold War can thus be seen as a rhetorical construction, in which its rhetorical dimensions gave meaning to its material manifestations, such as the national security state apparatus. This is not to say that the Cold War never existed per se, nor does it “make [it] any less real or less significant for being rhetorical” (Medhurst, 2000: 6). As Lynn Boyd Hinds and Theodore Otto Windt, Jr. stress, “political rhetoric creates political reality, structures belief systems, and provides the fundamental bases for decisions” (Hinds and Windt, cited in Medhurst, 2000: 6). In this sense, the Cold War ceases to be a historical period which meaning can be written permanently and becomes instead a struggle that is not context-specific and not geared towards one specific enemy. It is “an orientation towards difference in which those acting on behalf of an assumed but never fixed identity are tempted by the lure of otherness to interpret all dangers as fundamental threats which require the mobilization of a population” (Campbell, 2000: 227).</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Indeed, if the meaning of the Cold War is not context-specific, the concept of national security cannot be disconnected from what is known as the Cold War, since its very meaning(s) emerged within it (Rosenberg, 1993 : 277).11 If the American national security state is a given for realist analysts,12 it is important to ask whether we can conceive the United States during the Cold War as anything other than a national security state.13 To be clear, I am not suggesting that there is any such essentialized entity as a “national security state”.14 When I refer to the American national security state, I mean the representation of the American state in the early years of the Cold War, the spirit of which is embodied in the National Security Act of 1947 (Der Derian, 1992: 76). The term “national security state” designates both an institutionalization of a new governmental architecture designed to prepare the United States politically and militarily to face any foreign threat and the ideology – the discourse – that gave rise to as well as symbolized it. In other words, to understand the idea of a national security state, one needs to grasp the discursive power of national security in shaping the reality of the Cold War in both language and institutions</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> (Rosenberg, 1993 : 281). A national security state feeds on threats as it channels all its efforts into meeting current and future military or security threats. The creation of the CIA, the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Council at the onset of the Cold War gave impetus to a state mentality</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> geared to permanent preparedness for war. The construction of threats is thus essential to its well-being, making intelligence agencies privileged tools in accomplishing this task.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> As American historian of U.S. foreign relations Michael Hogan observes in his study on the rise of the national security state during the Truman administration, “the national security ideology framed the Cold War discourse in a system of symbolic representation that defined America’s national identity by reference to the un-American ‘other,’ usually the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, or some other totalitarian power” (Hogan, 1998: 17). Such a binary system made it difficult for any domestic dissent from U.S. policy to emerge – it would have “amounted to an act of disloyalty” (Hogan, 1998: 18).15 While Hogan distinguishes advocates from critics of the American national security state, his view takes for granted that there is a given and fixed American political culture that differs from the “new” national security ideology. It posits an “American way”, produced by its cultural, political, and historical experience. Although he stresses that differences between the two sides of the discourse are superficial, pertaining solely to the means, rather than the ends of the national security state, Hogan sees the national security state as a finished and legitimate state: an American state suited to the Cold War context of permanent war, while stopping short of a garrison state:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Although government would grow larger, taxes would go up, and budget deficits would become a matter of routine, none of these and other transformations would add up to the crushing regime symbolized in the metaphor of the garrison state. The outcome instead would be an American national security state that was shaped as much by the country’s democratic political culture as it was by the perceived military imperatives of the Cold War (Hogan, 1998: 22).</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> I disagree with this essentialist view of the state identity of the United States. The United States does not need to be a national security state. If it was and is still constructed as such by many realist discourses, it is because these discourses serve some political purpose. Moreover, in keeping with my poststructuralist inclinations, I maintain that identity need not be, and indeed never is, fixed. In a scheme in which “to say is to do”, that is, from a perspective that accepts the performativity of language, culture becomes a relational site where identity politics happens rather than being a substantive phenomenon. In this sense, culture is not simply a social context framing foreign policy decision-making. Culture is “a signifying part of the conditions of possibility for social being, […] the way in which culturalist arguments themselves secure the identity of subjects in whose name they speak” (Campbell, 1998: 221).</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> The Cold War national security culture represented in realist discourses was constitutive of the American national security state. There was certainly a conflation of theory and policy in the Cold War military-intellectual complex, which “were observers of, and active participants in, defining the meaning of the Cold War. They contributed to portray the enemy that both reflected and fueled predominant ideological strains within the American body politic. As scholarly partners in the national security state, they were instrumental in defining and disseminating a Cold War culture” (Rubin, 2001: 15). This national security culture was “a complex space where various representations and representatives of the national security state compete to draw the boundaries and dominate the murkier margins of international relations” (Der Derian, 1992: 41). The same Cold War security culture has been maintained by political practice (on the part of realist analysts and political leaders) through realist discourses in the post-9/11 era and once again reproduces the idea of a national security state.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> This (implicit) state identification is neither accidental nor inconsequential. From a poststructuralist vantage point, the identification process of the state and the nation is always a negative process for it is achieved by exclusion, violence, and marginalization. Thus, a deconstruction of practices that constitute and consolidate state identity is necessary: the writing of the state must be revealed through the analysis of the discourses that constitute it. The state and the discourses that (re)constitute it thus frame its very identity and impose a fictitious “national unity” on society; it is from this fictive and arbitrary creation of the modernist dichotomous discourses of inside/outside that the discourses (re)constructing the state emerge. It is in the creation of a Self and an Other in which the state uses it monopolistic power of legitimate violence – a power socially constructed, following Max Weber’s work on the ethic of responsibility – to construct a threatening Other differentiated from the “unified” Self, the national society (the nation).16 It is through this very practice of normative statecraft,17 which produces threatening Others, that the international sphere comes into being. David Campbell adds that it is by constantly articulating danger through foreign policy that the state’s very conditions of existence are generated18.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Security discourse causes apocalypse in the name of survival</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Peter Coviello, Asst Prof of English – Bowdoin, ‘1</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> (Queer Frontiers, ed. Boone, author’s italics)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Perhaps. But to claim that American culture is at present decisively postnuclear is not to say that the world we inhabit is in any way post-apocalyptic. Apocalypse, as I began by saying, changed – it did not go away. And here I want to hazard my second assertion: if, in the nuclear age of yesteryear, apocalypse signified an event threatening everyone and everything with (in Jacques Derrida’s suitably menacing phrase) “remainderless and a-symbolic destruction,”6 then in the postnuclear world apocalypse is an affair whose parameters are definitively local in shape and in substance, apocalypse is defined now by the affliction it brings somewhere else, always to an “other” people whose very presence might then be written as a kind of dangerous contagion, threatening the safety and the prosperity of a cherished “general population.” This fact seems to me to stand behind Susan Sontag’s incisive observation, from 1989, that, “Apocalypse is now a long-running serial: not ‘Apocalypse Now’ but ‘Apocalypse from Now On.’”7 The decisive point here in the perpetuation of the threat of apocalypse (the point Sontag goes on, at length, to miss) is that apocalypse is ever present because, as an element in a vast economy of power, it is ever useful. That is, through the perpetual threat of destruction – through the constant reproduction of the figure of apocalypse – agencies of power ensure their authority toact on and through the bodies of a particular population. No one turns this point more persuasively than Michel Foucault, who in the final chapter of his first volume of The History of Sexuality addresses himself to the problem of a power that is less repressive than productive, less life-threatening than, in his words, “life-administering.” Power, he contends, “exerts a positive influence on life … [and] endeavors to administer, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations.” In his brief comments on what he calls “the atomic situation,” however, Foucault insists as well that the productiveness of modern power must not be mistaken for a uniform repudiation of violent or even lethal means. For as “managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race,” agencies of modern power presume to act “on the behalf of the existence of everyone.” Whatsoever might beconstrued as a threat to life and survival serves to authorize any expression of force, no matter how invasive or, indeed, potentially annihilating. “If genocide is indeed the dream of modern power,” Foucault writes, “this is not because of a recent return to the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population.”8 For a state that would arm itself not with the power to kill its population, but with a more comprehensive power over the patterns and functioning of its collective life, the threat of an apocalyptic demise, nuclear orotherwise, seems a civic initiative that can scarcely be done without.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Vote neg to critique the aff’s security discourse as a prior question</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Graeme Cheeseman, Snr. Lecturer @ New South Wales, and Robert Bruce, ‘96</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> (Discourses of Danger &amp; Dread Frontiers, p. 5-9)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> This goal is pursued in ways which are still unconventional in the intellectual milieu of international relations in Australia, even though they are gaining influence worldwide as traditional modes of theory and practice are rendered inadequate by global trends that defy comprehension, let alone policy. The inability to give meaning to global changes reflects partly the enclosed, elitist world of professional security analysts and bureaucratic experts, where entry is gained by learning and accepting to speak a particular, exclusionary language. The contributors to this book are familiar with the discourse, but accord no privileged place to its ‘knowledge form as reality’ in debates on defence and security. Indeed, they believe that debate will be furthered only through a long overdue critical re-evaluation of elite perspectives. Pluralistic, democratically-oriented perspectives on Australia’s identity are both required and essential if Australia’s thinking on defence and security is to be invigorated.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> This is not a conventional policy book; nor should it be, in the sense of offering policy-makers and their academic counterparts sets of neat alternative solutions, in familiar language and format, to problems they pose. This expectation is in itself a considerable part of the problem to be analysed. It is, however, a book about policy, one that questions how problems are framed by policy-makers. It challenges the proposition that irreducible bodies of real knowledge on defence and security exist independently of their ‘context in the world’, and it demonstrates how security policy is articulated authoritatively by the elite keepers of that knowledge, experts trained to recognize enduring, universal wisdom. All others, from this perspective, must accept such wisdom or remain outside the expert domain, tainted by their inability to comply with the ‘rightness’ of the official line. But it is precisely the official line, or at least its image of the world, that needs to be problematised. If the critic responds directly to the demand for policy alternatives, without addressing this image, he or she is tacitly endorsing it. Before engaging in the policy debate the critics need to reframe the basic terms of reference. This book, then, reflects and underlines the importance of Antonio Gramsci and Edward Said’s ‘critical intellectuals’.15</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> The demand, tacit or otherwise, that the policy-maker’s frame of reference be accepted as the only basis for discussion and analysis ignores a three thousand year old tradition commonly associated with Socrates and purportedly integral to the Western tradition of democraticdialogue. More immediately, it ignores post-seventeenth century democratic traditions which insist that a good society must have within it some way of critically assessing its knowledge and the decisions based upon that knowledge which impact upon citizens of such a society. This is a tradition with a slightly different connotation in contemporary liberal democracies which, during the Cold War, were proclaimed different and superior to the totalitarian enemy precisely because there were institutional checks and balances upon power. In short, one of the major differences between ‘open societies’ and their (closed) counterparts behind the Iron Curtain was that the former encouraged the critical testing of the knowledge and decisions of the powerful and assessing them against liberal democratic principles. The latter tolerated criticism only on rare and limited occasions. For some, this represented the triumph of rational-scientific methods of inquiry and techniques of falsification. For others, especially since positivism and rationalism have lost much of their allure, it meant that for society to become open and liberal, sectors of the population must be independent of the state and free to question its knowledge and power. Though we do not expect this position to be accepted by every reader, contributors to this book believe that critical dialogue is long overdue in Australia and needs to be listened to. For all its liberal democratic trappings, Australia’s security community continues to invoke closed monological narratives on defence and security.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> This book also questions the distinctions between policy practice and academic theory that inform conventional accounts of Australian security. One of its major concerns, particularly in chapters 1 and 2, is to illustrate how theory is integral to the practice of security analysis and policy prescription. The book also calls on policy-makers, academics and students of defence and security to thinkcritically about what they are reading, writing and saying; to begin to ask, of their work and study, difficult and searching questions raised in other disciplines; to recognise, no matter how uncomfortable it feels, that what is involved in theory and practice is not the ability to identify a replacement for failed models, but a realisation that terms and concepts – state sovereignty, balance of power, security, and so on – are contested and problematic, and that the world is indeterminate, always becoming what is written about it. Critical analysis which shows how particular kinds of theoretical presumptions can effectively exclude vital areas of political life from analysis has direct practical implications for policy-makers, academics and citizens who face the daunting task of steering Australia through some potentially choppy international waters over the next few years. There is also much of interest in the chapters for those struggling to give meaning to a world where so much that has long been taken for granted now demands imaginative, incisive reappraisal. The contributors, too, have struggled to find meaning, often despairing at the terrible human costs of international violence. This is why readers will find no single, fully formed panacea for the world’s ills in general, or Australia’s security in particular. There are none. Every chapter, however, in its own way, offers something more than is found in orthodox literature, often by exposing ritualistic Cold War defence and security mind-sets that are dressed up as new thinking. Chapters 7 and 9, for example, present alternative ways of engaging in security and defence practice. Others (chapters 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8) seek to alert policy-makers, academics and students toalternative theoretical possibilities which might better serve an Australian community pursuing security and prosperity in an uncertain world. All chapters confront the policy community and its counterparts in the academy with a deep awareness of the intellectual and material constraints imposed by dominant traditions of realism, but they avoid dismissive and exclusionary terms which often in the past characterized exchanges between policy-makers and their critics. This is because, as noted earlier, attention needs to be paid to the words and the thought processes of those being criticized. A close reading of this kind draws attention to underlying assumptions, showing they need to be recognized and questioned. A sense of doubt (in place of confident certainty) is a necessary prelude to a genuine search for alternative policies. First comes an awareness of the need for new perspectives, then specific policies may follow.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> As Jim George argues in the following chapter, we need to look not so much at contending policies as they are made for us but at challenging ‘the discursive process which gives [favoured interpretations of “reality”] their meaning and which direct [Australia’s] policy/analytical/military responses’. This process is not restricted to the small, official defence and security establishment huddled around the US-Australian War Memorial in Canberra. It also encompasses much of Australia’s academic defence and security community located primarily though not exclusively within the Australian National University and the University College of the University of New South Wales. These discursive processes are examined in detail in subsequent chapters as authors attempt to make sense of a politics of exclusion and closure which exercises disciplinary power over Australia’s security community. They also question the discourse of ‘regional security’, ‘security cooperation’, ‘peacekeeping’ and ‘alliance politics’ that are central to Australia’s official and academic security agenda in the 1990s. This is seen as an important task especially when, as is revealed, the disciplines of International Relations and Strategic Studies are under challenge from critical and theoretical debates ranging across the social sciences and humanities; debates that are nowhere to be found in Australian defence and security studies. The chapters graphically illustrate how Australia’s public policies on defence and security are informed, underpinned and legitimised by a narrowly-based intellectual enterprise which draws strength from contested concepts of realism and liberalism, which in turn seek legitimacy through policy-making processes. Contributors ask whether Australia’s policy-makers and their academic advisors are unaware of broader intellectual debates, or resistant to them, or choose not to understand them, and why?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Contention One – Solvency Positive incentives from the U.S. are key to Chinese MTCR complianceMoltz 1997 (James Clay Moltz, PhD, Assoc. Prof. Nat’l Security Affairs @ Naval Postgraduate School, “Missile Proliferation in East Asia: Arms Control vs. TMD Responses,” in the Nonproliferation Review, Summer,<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/moltz43.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/moltz43.pdf</a></span>) Another area where Chinese behavior has clashed with U.S. policies has been in sale of missile technologies, especially toIran, Pakistan, and other states which Washington regards as having dangerous proliferation intentions. Therefore, another missile initiative worth discussing with China would be new CBMs that would put teeth into Chinese promises regarding the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). To date, U.S. efforts have largely failed in this regard. The problem relates in part to the lack of positive incentives offered by the United States to date in areas that China cares about. If Washington agreed to halt arms sales of TMD technologies to Taiwan, however, it is likely that Beijing would begin to treat more seriously U.S. efforts to reach a quid pro quo on halting exports of missile technology to countries of U.S. concern Contention Two – Prolif China’s the key supplier of tech to Pakistan – only diplomacy can stop this – sanctions empirically failKan 2009 (Shirley A. Kan, specialist in Asian Security Affairs, works in the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Division of the Congressional Research Service, “China and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Missiles: Policy Issues,” in CRS Report for US Congress, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL31555.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL31555.pdf</a></span>) Congress has long been concerned about whether U.S. policy advances the national interest in reducing the role of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and missiles that could deliver them.Recipients of China’s technology reportedly include Pakistan and countries that the State Department says support terrorism, such as Iran and North Korea. This CRS Report, updated as warranted, discusses the security problem of China’s role in weapons proliferation and issues related to the U.S. policy response since the mid-1990s. China has taken some steps to mollify U.S. and other foreign concerns about its role in weapons proliferation. Nonetheless, supplies from China have aggravated trends that result in ambiguous technical aid, more indigenous capabilities, longer-range missiles, and secondary (retransferred) proliferation. According to unclassified intelligence reports submitted as required to Congress, China has been a “key supplier” of technology to North Korea, Iran, and Pakistan for use in programs to develop ballistic missiles, chemical weapons, or nuclear weapons. Policy issues in seeking PRC cooperation have concerned summits, sanctions, and satellite exports. On November 21, 2000, the Clinton Administration agreed to waive missile proliferation sanctions, resume processing licenses to export satellites to China, and discuss an extension of the bilateral space launch agreement, in return for another promise from China on missile nonproliferation. However, continued PRC proliferation activities again raised questions about sanctions. In contrast to the Clinton Administration, the Bush Administration repeatedly imposed sanctions on PRC “entities” for troublesome transfers. Since 1991, the United States has imposed sanctions on 26 occasions on over 30 different PRC “entities” (not the government) for transfers (related to missiles and chemical weapons) to Pakistan, Iran, or another country, including repeated sanctions on some “serial proliferators.” Among those sanctions, in September 2001, the Administration imposed missile proliferation sanctions that effectively denied satellite exports (for two years), after a PRC company transferred technology to Pakistan, despite the November 2000 promise. In September 2003, the State Department imposed additional sanctions on NORINCO, a defense industrial entity, effectively denying satellite exports to China. However, for six times, the State Department waived this sanction for the ban on imports of other PRC government products related to missiles, space systems, electronics, andmilitary aircraft, and issued a permanent waiver in March 2007.Skeptics question whether China’s cooperation in weapons nonproliferation has warranted the U.S. pursuit of closer bilateral ties, even as sanctions were required against some PRC supplies of sensitive technology. Some question the imposition of numerous U.S. sanctions targeting PRC “entities” but not the PRC government. Others question the effectiveness of any stress on sanctions over diplomacy. Since 2002, the United States has relied on China’s “considerable influence” on North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons and praised its role, but Beijing has hosted the “Six-Party Talks” with limited results, while the United States also resumed bilateral negotiations with North Korea. China has evolved to vote for some U.N. Security Council sanctions against nuclear proliferation in North Korea and Iran. But it also has maintained balanced positions on North Korea and Iran, including questionable enforcement of sanctions and business as usual (particularly energy deals). Some have called for pressing Beijing to use effective leverage against Pyongyang and Tehran. However, North Korea’s second nuclear test in May 2009 prompted greater debate about the importance of China and the Six-Party Talks. Still, at a summit in Beijing on November 17, 2009, President Obama discussed China’s “support” for nuclear nonproliferation in North Korea and Iran. This causes an Indo-Pak conflict that escalates to global nuclear war – it’s the most probable scenarioBlank 2009 (Stephen J. Blank, Assoc. Prof. Soviet Studies at the Center for Aerospace Doctrine – Maxwell Air Force Base, SSI expert on the Soviet bloc and post-Soviet world, Prospects for U.S.-Russian Security Cooperation, March, Strategic Studies Institute, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB892.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB892.pdf</a></span>) Other reasons for concern about cruise missiles relate to developments like the Ukrainian revelation in 2005 of illicit missile transfers of the Kh-55 cruise missile, a long-range nuclear-capable cruise missile (NATO designation AS-15 Kent) to Iran and China, and the Indo-Russian joint Brahmos project. The Kh-55 has a range of 2-300Km at subsonic speed with high precision, and represented Irano-Chinese access to a higher level of technological sophistication than was previously the case. The Brahmos (PJ-10) is a supersonic anti-ship ramjet-powered cruise missile and has a 300Km range and identical configuration for land-sea, 190 and sub-sea launching platforms.77 The spread of these systems and the fact that countries as diverse as Sweden, France, China, and Taiwan were working on advanced cruise missiles in 2005, underscore the porosity of existing anti-proliferation regimes, including the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and the ensuing rising threat from missile proliferation which has continued without letup since 2005.78Furthermore Gormley’s evidence of trends in cruise missiles proliferation and improvements to them underscores the danger of missile and nuclear proliferation from another angle. According to his evidence, “signs of a missile contagion abound.” Pakistan surprised the world by test launching Tomahawk look-alike cruise missiles. India, together with Russia, is developing the Brahmos supersonic cruise missile, which will have the capability to strike targets at sea or over land to a range of 290 kilometers.In East Asia, China, Taiwan, and South Korea are rushing to develop and deploy new Land Attack Cruise Missiles (LACMs) with ranges of 1,000Km or more, while Japan is contemplating the development of a LACM for “preemptive” strikes against enemy missile bases. In the Middle East, Israel was once the sole country possessing LACMs, but now Iran appears to be pursuing cruise missile programs for both land and sea attack. Iran has also provided the terrorist group Hezbollah with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and sophisticated anti-ship cruise missiles, one of which severely damaged an Israeli vessel and killed four soldiers during the 2006 war in Lebanon. In April 2005, Ukraine’s export agency unveiled plans to market a new LACM called Korshun. The design of this new missile appears to be based solely on the Russian Kh55, a nuclear-capable, 3,000Km-range LACM, which 191 Ukrainian and Russian arms dealers had illegally sold to China in 2000 and Iran in 2001.79When we bear in mind what Lennox had to say about the impact of the illicit Kh-55 transfers, the dangers of that particular missile or its Ukrainian “clone” become quite real. Furthermore, as Gormley points out this “epidemic” or “contagion” could not have happened without the willing participation of other parties. Thus, Chinese fingerprints are all over Pakistan’s newly tested LACM, while Russian engineering is known to have enabled China to produce a workable propulsion system for its new LACMs. Russian technical assistance, formalized in a joint production agreement, has helped India to produce and deploy its first cruise missile, the supersonic Brahmos. Iran’s three new cruise missile programs depend heavily on foreign-trained engineers who honed their skills in France, Germany, Russia, China, and North Korea. Thus while the flow of technology components is necessary, it is not sufficient to enable cruise missile proliferation without the critical support of a small and exceptionally skilled group of engineering practitioners.80Certainly such trends raise the question of missile defenses, but they should also stimulate greater cooperation against missile and nuclear proliferation. And it is not only a question of missile defenses. As we shall see, in South and East Asia, for example, states and governments are also trying to counter their rivals’ offensive missile programs by developing their own “superior” programs whereby both sides rely on a purely offensive missile capability race against their rivals. Moreover, the universality of these trends makes clear that it is not only in the Middle East that we must worry about proliferation.192 For example, we find this competitive offense model in East Asia. Because of its concerns about the consequences of the DPRK’s proliferation, Washington, in 2001 persuaded Seoul to accept a 300Km range and 500Kg payload limit on ballistic missiles as a condition of South Korea’s entry into the MTCR. Yet Washington allowed Seoul to develop LACMs with no conditions. The consequences were not long in coming, especially as South Korea, mindful of Chinese pressure, the costs involved, and its own strategic vulnerability to North Korea, has rejected participation in the U.S. missile defense system and the U.S. proposals to sell it the Patriot missile defense system. As Gormley notes,Shortly after Pyongyang’s October 2006 nuclear test, South Korean military authorities leaked the existence of three LACM programs, involving ranges of 500Km, 1,000Km, and 1,500Km. The South Korean press took immediate note of the fact that not just all of North Korea would be within range of these missiles, but also neighboring countries, including Japan and China. Nearly simultaneously Seoul’s military rolled out a new defense plan, involving preemptive use of “surgical strike” weapons, including its LACMs, against enemy missile batteries.81The same kind of dominance of the offensive based on mutual deterrence, an inherently hostile posture between two states armed with missiles, not to mention nuclear missiles, is occurring in Taiwan. Although Washington has successfully persuaded Taiwan to steer clear of ballistic missiles, faced with China’s relentless buildup of conventional missiles against it, Taiwan bought Patriots but demurred from buying the latest U.S. hit-to-kill missile defense due to the Chinese buildup and the cost of the U.S. system. Instead, it started developing its own LACMs in 2005, originally 193 with a range of 500Km, but with the intention of ultimately deploying 500 of them with ranges of 1,000 Km on mobile launchers. Taiwanese military leaders spoke increasingly of a “preventive self-defense” strike option, to disrupt China’s plans. And recent evidence suggests that Taiwan also now has started a ballistic missile program.82South Asia.As the foregoing analysis strongly argues, the urgency of reviving great power cooperation on proliferation and the enhanced capability of missiles and regimes is not confined to the Middle East or Northeast Asia where nonproliferation appears to have succeeded to some degree vis-à-vis North Korea. Indeed, there is a distinct spillover of proliferation trends or events from Northeast Asia to South Asia and vice versa. The North Korean-Pakistani reciprocal supply relationship of missile and nuclear technologies is an outstanding example of such spillover. At least in part due to this relationship, pressures for not only proliferation but also missile defense programs are growing in both Japan and India. In turn, those programs could ultimately have transformative strategic implications across Asia.83 Both Russia and China have already registered their strong opposition to Japan’s missile defense program and its strengthening of its alliance with America as a result of that program.84 Were India to be added to this relationship, the consequences throughout Asia and world politics would be immense and profound.In the context of that DPRK-Pakistani relationship, we need to remember that the single biggest proliferator in the last generation has been Pakistan through the A. 194 Q. Khan operation that has been extensively described at least as regards its public record.85 Khan (whom it is difficult to believe was not working with the knowledge and consent of Pakistani military and political authorities) sold centrifuge and other technologies to North Korea and Iran as well as to other proliferators like Libya.86 As noted above, India and Pakistan are expanding the number, range, and type of their nuclear weapons and missiles, e.g., moving to submarine-based systems and developing the capability for strikes across a greater distance with conventional missiles, e.g., the Agni missile.87 Both states are also developing new and advanced conventional weapons that could be used in a bilateral or proxy war between them or between one of them and the other’s proxy. Indeed, recently there have been charges that Pakistan continues to sell nuclear technology and that Khan’s former middlemen are still trying to acquire those technologies.88</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> Thus the danger of a conventional war between India and Pakistan or proxies acting in their behalf presents the real possibility of an escalation first to missile war and then nuclear war. Indeed, as the stability-instability theory tells us, the possession by both sides of nuclear war capability paradoxically “makes the region (or the world) safe for conventional war” in the belief that the other side will be deterred due to the aggressor’s possession of a nuclear capability. Thus stability at the nuclear level creates the paradox of giving openings to governments or even to terrorist groups to trigger instability at lower levels of conflict. Those crises could then spiral out of control into bigger wars. The many crises in the region, the last one being in 2001-02, indicate just how precarious regional stability is, and Pakistan’s continuing ambivalence about supporting 195 terrorist and Islamist military forces in Kashmir and against Afghanistan provide ample opportunities for such a war to break out. </span><br />

<span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">After years of trade policy stalemate, there could be big strides in 2011 with approval of US trade deals with South Korea,</span></span> Panama and Colombia, Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization and perhaps even the end of the longest-ever round of global trade talks. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Republican takeover of the House of Representatives, a sluggish US economic recovery and President Barack Obama's goal of doubling exports could combine to spur action on several fronts</span></span>, analysts say<span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">. 2011 could be big year for Obama on trade &quot;It might be a very big year,&quot;</span></span>said Ed Gresser, president of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. Government data shows US exports likely grew about 17% last year, one of the fastest rates ever as world trade bounced back from a historic slump brought about by the financial crisis. But Obama needs exports to grow about 15% annually during the next four years to double them, which will be difficult without new market-opening agreements, Gresser said. With US consumers rebuilding battered balance sheets, the economy will need to lean more heavily on the export sector. Stronger US export growth in turn would help bring about a more-balanced pattern of global trade. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The White House took a big step toward winning congressional approval of the South Korea pact in December by renegotiating auto provisions to win the support of the United Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co</span></span>. Many Democrats still oppose the deal and are even more steadfast in opposition to the Colombia agreement but newly empowered Republicans are eager to pass all three trade deals. &quot;The unknown is to what extent the Republican leadership will demand to vote on all three&quot; if Obama balks at submitting one or both of the Latin American pacts, said Dan Griswold, director of the Cato Institute's trade policy section. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Both Gresser and Griswold said they believed there would be votes to pass all of them if Obama made a big push.</span></span><br />

<span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">There are no higher priorities for our country right now than job creation and economic growth</span></span>. As the new Congress begins, every decision we make must be tied directly to those goals. If we are going to get our economy back on track, we need to take several key steps. These include making the current tax rates permanent, repealing the job-killing health care law and dramatically reducing federal spending. Some of these efforts will divide Congress politically. But they are all a part of what House Republicans pledged we would do — and of what the American people expect us to do. At the same time, there are areas in which both parties can work together. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">A strong trade agenda presents a unique opportunity to promote economic growth, global partnerships and bipartisan cooperation</span></span>. Unfortunately, the trade agenda has been allowed to languish for the past four years and, in some cases, has been thwarted. In the meantime, our economy and our global prestige have suffered. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">There’s never been a more important time to re-engage on trade</span></span>. Trade is often blamed for every manner of society’s ills. Globally connected commerce has been accused of having a hand in everything from terrorism to pandemics. In December, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez blamed it for the tragic mudslides that claimed dozens of lives in his nation and in Colombia. Setting aside the disservice that such a claim does for addressing the true root causes of the great challenges we face, the reality of the role of trade is precisely the opposite of what this viewpoint presents. International trade plays an important part in improving a nation’s circumstances — far beyond the immediate scope of exports and imports. Given the current climate, the direct economic impact is the most urgent. Opening up new markets for U.S. producers, farmers, service providers and investors is essential for spurring growth and creating new job opportunities for both union and nonunion workers here at home. The three markets with which we have pending free-trade agreements — Colombia, Panama and South Korea — represent 96 million consumers and $1.8 trillion in economic activity. The opportunity for U.S. job creators is enormous, so the delay in the agreements’ consideration is unjustifiable<span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">. </span></span><span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The benefits of trade</span></span>, however, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">extend considerably beyond job creation and economic growth. Economic engagement across borders builds the strong global partnerships that are necessary to address</span></span> the challenges of the 21st century. Whether the issue <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is tariffs or nuclear proliferation, the trust and spirit of collaboration forged through economic ties help the United States advance its interests and spread its values around the globe. Enhancing prosperity through international trade also creates the resources necessary for essential efforts like improving environmental quality, protecting human rights and building democratic institutions. Raising living standards,</span></span> in fact, <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">helps alleviate</span></span> many of society’s ills, including <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">terrorism, pandemics and</span></span>, yes, even <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the ability to respond to natural disasters</span></span> in South America. Reviving the trade agenda also helps with another challenge: partisan politics. Trade once enjoyed a strong bipartisan consensus. The last time there was a new Republican majority, we were enthusiastic about working with then-President Bill Clinton on the trade agenda. That collaboration produced some of the biggest bipartisan achievements of the 1990s. We are eager, again, to join with a Democratic president in revitalizing America’s global leadership role in trade liberalization. President Barack Obama has demonstrated a commitment to expanding trade by finalizing negotiations on a side agreement with South Korea, as well as through his National Export Initiative. Republicans stand ready as committed partners in these efforts to create new opportunities for Americans through greater international trade. <span class="BoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">By working together to pass our three pending free-trade agreements and re-engaging in the bilateral, regional and multilateral negotiations that have languished, we can revive our stagnant job market and sluggish economy</span></span>. We can re-energize our relationships with key international partners. What’s more, we can demonstrate that Republicans and Democrats can come together for the sake of our economy and our country. Though many of the issues the 112th Congress faces will inevitably lead to a clash of ideas, both parties can and should work together with a renewed commitment to economic growth and global leadership through trade.<br />

 Afghan Pullout devastates US credibility and ends hegemony *<br />

<strong>In 1979 the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. A little less than a decade later, the Soviets left, humiliated and defeated. Within months the Berlin Wall fell and two years later the USSR was no more. Westerners may debate whether credit for these events belongs chiefly to Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II, Charlie Wilson or any number of people who stuck a needle in the Soviet balloon. But in Islamist mythology, it was Afghan and Arab mujahedeen who brought down the godless superpower. And if one superpower could be brought down, why not the other?</strong><br />
<strong>Put simply, it was the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan that laid much of the imaginative groundwork for 9/11. So imagine the sorts of notions that would take root in the minds of jihadists—and the possibilities that would open up to them—if the U.S. was to withdraw from Afghanistan in its own turn.</strong><br />
<strong>Notion One: Attacks on the scale of 9/11 are by no means fatal to the cause of radical Islam. On the contrary, despite the huge losses the movement has suffered over the past eight years, it would emerge from a U.S. defeat in Afghanistan with something it was denied in Iraq: a monumental political and ideological victory from which it could recruit a new field of avid jihadists. Ergo, further attacks on the U.S. homeland could yield similar long-term benefits.</strong><br />
<strong>Notion Two: The U.S. has no stomach for long-term counterinsurgency. Ergo, surrender or political accommodation to apparent U.S. military success is pointless; if you hold out long enough, they leave and you win.</strong><br />
<strong>Notion Three: The U.S. is not prepared to stand by its clients in the Third World if it believes those clients are morally tainted. That happened to South Vietnam's Nguyen Van Thieu, it happened to the Shah of Iran and, if the U.S. leaves Afghanistan, it will happen to the lamentable Hamid Karzai. Ergo, other shaky or dubious U.S. allies in the Muslim world—Algeria, for instance, or, yes, Saudi Arabia—are prime targets for renewed assault.</strong><br />
<strong>Notion Four: A U.S. that doesn't have the stomach for a relatively easy fight like Afghanistan, where even now casualties are a fraction of what they were in Iraq during the worst of the fighting, will have even less stomach for much tougher fights. Ergo, maximum efforts should go into destabilizing and, not implausibly, taking over Pakistan, a country that, as Mr. Will says, &quot;actually matters.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>And from here the possibilities flow. Withdrawal from Afghanistan, and a Taliban takeover in Kandahar and perhaps Kabul, would plunge Afghanistan into another civil war infinitely bloodier than what we have now. Withdrawal would force Islamabad to abandon its war on terror and again come to terms with its own militants, as it did in the 1990s. Only this time, it wouldn't be clear who is patron and who is client. Withdrawal would give Pakistan's jihadists the freedom to shift fronts to India, with all the nightmare scenarios that entails. Withdrawal would invite the al Qaeda remnant in Iraq—already on an upswing—to redouble its efforts, and do so with the confidence that the U.S. has permanently soured on Middle Eastern interventions.</strong><br />
<strong>This is a partial list. The alternative is a winding and bloody struggle to defend and improve a hapless and often corrupt government in a godforsaken land of often (though by no means pervasively) ungrateful people. This is not the noblest fight, and no sane nation would wage it by choice. But we did not choose it and, if we keep our nerve, we can win it. Otherwise, the consequence will be ashes flying again in our own streets, something to remember on the eve of another 9/11 anniversary.</strong><br />

<strong>Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because a world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts. Finally, U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system</strong><br />
