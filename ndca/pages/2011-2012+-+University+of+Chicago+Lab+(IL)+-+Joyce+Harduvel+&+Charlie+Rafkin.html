<em>In its annual survey, the monitoring group Freedom House, which uses a range of data to assess social, political and economic freedoms, found that global freedom plummeted for the fifth year in a row in 2010, the longest continuous decline in nearly 40 years. In fact, there are now fewer elected democracies than there were in 1995. A mountain of other evidence supported Freedom House's findings. One of the other most comprehensive studies of global democracy, compiled by Germany's Bertelsmann Foundation, uses data examining the ability of democracies to function, manage government and uphold freedoms to produce what it calls the Transformation Index. The most recent index found &quot;the overall quality of democracy has eroded [throughout the developing world] ... the key components of a functioning democracy, such as political participation and civil liberties, have suffered qualitative erosion ... these developments threaten to hollow out the quality and substance of governance&quot;. The index concluded that the number of &quot;highly defective democracies&quot; - democracies with institutions, elections and political culture so flawed that they no longer qualified as real democracies - had roughly doubled between 2006 and 2010. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Index of Democracy only further confirmed these findings. The unit analyses democracy using categories for electoral process, pluralism, political participation, political culture, functioning of government and civil liberties. It found that democracy was in retreat around the globe. &quot;In all regions, the average democracy score for 2010 is lower than in 2008,&quot; it reported. In 91 of 167 countries it studied, the democracy score had deteriorated in that time period and in many others it had only remained stagnant. Of the 79 nations that it assessed as having some significant democratic qualities, only 26 made the grade as what the EIU calls &quot;full democracies&quot;, while the other 53 were ranked only as &quot;flawed democracies&quot; because of serious deficiencies in many of the areas it assessed. In Latin America, Africa, Asia and even most of Africa, coups, which had been a frequent means of changing governments during the Cold War, had become nearly extinct by the early 2000s. But between 2006 and 2010, the military grabbed power in Mauritania, Niger, Guinea-Bissau, Bangladesh, Fiji and Madagascar, among others. In many other developing nations, such as Mexico, Pakistan and the Philippines, the military managed to restore its power as the central actor in political life, dominating the civilian governments that clung to power only through the support of the armed forces. &quot;It's almost like we've gone back to the [Ferdinand] Marcos era,&quot; prominent Filipino rights activist and lawyer Harry Roque Jr said, as he waited in his office for the security forces to come and interrogate him. &quot;There's the same type of fear, the same abuses, the same attitude by the military that their actions will never face consequences.&quot; Support for democracy has become so tepid in parts of the developing world that many of these coups were cheered: in Niger last year, thousands celebrated the military takeover in Niamey, the capital, in part because the overthrown leader had been destroying the country's democratic institutions. Overall, an analysis of military coups in developing nations over the past 20 years, conducted by David Silverman, my Council on Foreign Relations research associate, found that in nearly 50 per cent of cases drawn from Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, middle-class men and women either agitated in advance for the coup, or, in polls or prominent media coverage afterwards, expressed their support for the army takeover. Opinion polls also reveal that the quality of democracy is declining, but also that how the public views democracy is deteriorating as well. The Barometer Series of polls uses questionnaires to ask people in a range of nations about their views on democracy. The survey of the African continent has found declining levels of support for democracy in many countries. Meanwhile, in Russia, where hope for democracy was high in the early 1990s, today the New Europe Barometer shows that half of Russians believe it is acceptable to stop having elections if this decision strengthens the country. Elsewhere, in Ecuador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Colombia, Peru, Honduras and Nicaragua, either a minority or only a tiny majority of people think democracy is preferable to any other type of government. Polls and studies of South Asia have revealed similar dissatisfaction. In Pakistan, roughly 60 per cent of respondents in a comprehensive regional survey said the country should be ruled by the army. Even in East Asia, one of the most economically vibrant regions of the world, polls reveal the same rising dissatisfaction with democracy. In fact, several countries in the region have developed what Yu-tzung Chang, Yunhan Zhu and Chong-min Park, who studied data from the regular Asian Barometer surveys, have termed &quot;authoritarian nostalgia&quot;. &quot;Few of the region's former authoritarian regimes have been thoroughly discredited,&quot; they write, noting that the region's average score for commitment to democracy has fallen in the most recent studies. Even in South Korea, one of the supposed success stories of democracy, the percentage of respondents saying an authoritarian government was preferable under certain circumstances, doubled between 1996 and 2006.</em><br />

In addition to improving the lives of individual citizens in new democracies, the spread of democracy will benefit the international system by reducing the likelihood of war. Democracies do not wage war on other democracies. This absence-or near absence, depending on the definitions of &quot;war&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot; used-has been called &quot;one of the strongest nontrivial and nontautological generalizations that can be made about international relations.&quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn51" rel="nofollow">51</a> One scholar argues that &quot;the absence of war between democracies comes as close as anything we have to an empirical law in international relations.&quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn52" rel="nofollow">52</a> If the number of democracies in the international system continues to grow, the number of potential conflicts that might escalate to war will diminish. Although wars between democracies and nondemocracies would persist in the short run, in the long run an international system composed of democracies would be a peaceful world. At the very least, adding to the number of democracies would gradually enlarge the democratic &quot;zone of peace.&quot; Many studies have found that there are virtually no historical cases of democracies going to war with one another. In an important two-part article published in 1983, Michael Doyle compares all international wars between 1816 and 1980 and a list of liberal states.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn53" rel="nofollow">53</a> Doyle concludes that &quot;constitutionally secure liberal states have yet to engage in war with one another.&quot;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn54" rel="nofollow">54</a> Subsequent statistical studies have found that this absence of war between democracies is statistically significant and is not the result of random chance.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn55" rel="nofollow">55</a> Other analyses have concluded that the influence of other variables, including geographical proximity and wealth, do not detract from the significance of the finding that democracies rarely, if ever, go to war with one another.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn56" rel="nofollow">56</a> Most studies of the democratic-peace proposition have argued that democracies only enjoy a state of peace with other democracies; they are just as likely as other states to go to war with nondemocracies.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn57" rel="nofollow">57</a> There are, however, several scholars who argue that democracies are inherently less likely to go to war than other types of states.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn58" rel="nofollow">58</a> The evidence for this claim remains in dispute, however, so it would be premature to claim that spreading democracy will do more than to enlarge the democratic zone of peace. Two types of explanations have been offered for the absence of wars between democracies. The first argues that shared norms prevent democracies from fighting one another. The second claims that institutional (or structural) constraints make it difficult or impossible for a democracy to wage war on another democracy.<br />
The normative explanation of the democratic peace argues that norms that democracies share preclude wars between democracies. One version of this argument contends that liberal states do not fight other liberal states because to do so would be to violate the principles of liberalism. Liberal states only wage war when it advances the liberal ends of increased individual freedom. A liberal state cannot advance liberal ends by fighting another liberal state, because that state already upholds the principles of liberalism. In other words, democracies do not fight because liberal ideology provides no justification for wars between liberal democracies.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn59" rel="nofollow">59</a> A second version of the normative explanation claims that democracies share a norm of peaceful conflict resolution. This norm applies between and within democratic states. Democracies resolve their domestic conflicts without violence, and they expect that other democracies will resolve inter-democratic international disputes peacefully.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn60" rel="nofollow">60</a><br />
Institutional/structural explanations for the democratic peace contend that democratic decision-making procedures and institutional constraints prevent democracies from waging war on one another. At the most general level, democratic leaders are constrained by the public, which is sometimes pacific and generally slow to mobilize for war. In most democracies, the legislative and executive branches check the war-making power of each other. These constraints may prevent democracies from launching wars. When two democracies confront one another internationally, they are not likely to rush into war. Their leaders will have more time to resolve disputes peacefully.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn61" rel="nofollow">61</a> A different sort of institutional argument suggests that democratic processes and freedom of speech make democracies better at avoiding myths and misperceptions that cause wars.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn62" rel="nofollow">62</a><br />

Bueno de Mequita, Morrow, Siverson, and Smith are among the few who have sought to overcome the conceptual dilemmas noted above. Specifically they have provided insights on the link between institutions and foreign policy choices with reference to international disputes and conflicts. They find that democratic leaders, when faced with a choice, are more likely to shift greater resources to war efforts than leaders of the autocratic governments because political survival of the elected democratic regime demands successful policy performance, especially as the winning coalition grows. Thus, democratic regimes tend to have a military edge over autocratic regimes in war because of the extra efforts required. Also, &quot;<span style="text-decoration: none;">democratic leaders only choose to fight when they are confident of victory. Otherwise they prefer to negotiate</span>.&quot; (22) Bueno de Mequita and his colleagues conclude, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Democrats make</span> relatively <span style="text-decoration: none;">unattractive targets because domestic</span> reselection <span style="text-decoration: none;">pressures cause leaders to mobilize resources for the war effort.</span> This makes it harder for other states to target them for aggression<span style="text-decoration: none;">. In addition</span> to trying harder than autocrats, <span style="text-decoration: none;">democrats are more selective in</span> their<span style="text-decoration: none;"> choice of targets</span>. Defeat typically leads to domestic replacement for democrats, so they only initiate war when they expect to win. These two factors lead to the interaction between polities that is often termed the democratic peace. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Autocrats need a slight expected advantage</span> over other autocratic adversaries <span style="text-decoration: none;">in devoting</span> additional <span style="text-decoration: none;">resources to the war effort</span>. In order to initiate war, democrats need overwhelming odds of victory, but that does not mean they are passive. Because democrats use their resources for the war effort rather than reserve them to reward backers, they are generally able, given their selection criteria for fighting, to overwhelm autocracies, which results in short and relatively less costly wars. Yet, democracies find it hard to overwhelm other democracies because they also try hard. In general, democracies make unattractive targets, particularly for other democracies. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Hence, democratic states rarely attack one another</span>. (23)<br />

<em>Responses: Mansfield and Snyder have advanced an important new argument, but even if partially true, it does not refute the case for spreading democracy internationally. Taken to extremes, the Mansfield/Snyder argument would amount to a case for opposing all political change on the grounds that it might cause instability. Promoting democracy makes more sense than this course, because the risks of democratization are not so high and uncontrollable that we should give up on attempts to spread democracy.</em><br />
<em>First, there are reasons to doubt the strength of the relationship between democratization and war. Other quantitative studies challenge the statistical significance of Mansfield and Snyder''s results, suggest that there is an even stronger connection between movements toward autocracy and the onset of war, find that it is actually unstable transitions and reversals of democratization that increase the probability of war, and argue that democratization diminishes the likelihood of militarized international disputes.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn115" rel="nofollow">115</a> In particular, autocracies are likely to exploit nationalism and manipulate public opinion to launch diversionary wars-the same causal mechanisms that Mansfield and Snyder claim are at work in democratizing states. Mansfield and Snyder themselves point out that &quot;reversals of democratization are nearly as risky as democratization itself,&quot; thereby bolstering the case for assisting the consolidation of new democracies.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn116" rel="nofollow">116</a> In addition, very few of the most recent additions to the ranks of democracies have engaged in wars. In Central and Eastern Europe, for example, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia have avoided major internal and external conflicts. Of these countries, only Slovenia was involved in brief series of military skirmishes with Serbia.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn117" rel="nofollow">117</a> Russia has been involved in a number of small wars on or near its borders, but so far it has undergone a dramatic transition toward democracy without becoming very warlike.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn118" rel="nofollow">118</a> There is little evidence of international war in Latin America, which also has witnessed a large-scale transition to democracy in recent years. Countries such as Mongolia and South Africa appear to have made the transition to democracy without going to war. The new democracies plagued by the most violence, including some former Soviet republics and the republics of the former Yugoslavia, are those that are the least democratic and may not qualify as democracies at all.</em><br />
<em>All of this evidence suggests that whatever may have increased the war-proneness of democratizing states in the past may not be present in the contemporary international system. It may be that states making the transition from feudalism to democracy became more war-prone or that the emerging democracies of the 19th century were European great powers that embarked on imperial wars of conquest. These factors will not lead today''s new democracies into war. Finally, if the democratic peace proposition is correct, the higher proportion of democracies in the current international system may further reduce the risk that new democracies will not engage in war, because they will find themselves in a world of many democracies instead of one of many potentially hostile nondemocracies.</em><br />
<em>Second, it is possible to control any risks of war posed by democratization. Mansfield and Snyder identify several useful policies to mitigate any potential risks of democratization. Old elites that are threatened by democratization can be given &quot;golden parachutes&quot; that enable them to at least retain some of their wealth and to stay out of jail.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn119" rel="nofollow">119</a> New democracies also need external assistance to build up the journalistic infrastructure that will support a &quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; that can prevent manipulation of public opinion and nationalistic mythmaking.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn120" rel="nofollow">120</a> Finally, an international environment conducive to free trade</em><br />

<em>OTHER THREATS This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security and well-being in the coming years and decades.

Precisely because, within their own borders, they respect competition, civil liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.</em><br />

The critics of the democratic peace have presented vigorous arguments that have forced the proposition''s proponents to refine and qualify the case for the democratic peace. These criticisms do not, however, refute the principal arguments for the democratic peace. As I argue below, there is still a compelling deductive and empirical case that democracies are extremely unlikely to fight one another. Moreover, the case for spreading democracy does not rest entirely on the democratic-peace proposition. Although those who favor promoting democracy often invoke the democratic peace, the debate over whether the United States should spread democracy is not the same as the debate over the democratic peace. Even if the critics were able to undermine the democratic-peace proposition, their arguments would not negate the case for spreading democracy, because there are other reasons for promoting democracy. More important, the case for promoting democracy as a means of building peace remains sound if the spread of democracy merely reduces the probability of war between democracies, whereas &quot;proving&quot; the democratic peace proposition requires showing that the probability of such wars is at or close to zero.<br />

<em>The Argument: Critics of the democratic peace point to apparent wars between democracies as evidence that there is no democratic peace. They frequently cite the War of 1812, the Spanish-American War, Finland''s decision to align with Germany against the Western powers and the Soviet Union during World War Two, the American Civil War, World War One, and the wars that followed the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. At least 17 conflicts have been cited as potential wars between democracies.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn93" rel="nofollow">93</a></em><br />
<em>Responses: There are three reasons to reject the claim that the democratic peace proposition is invalid because democracies may have fought some wars. First, the democratic peace propositionCcorrectly formulated-holds that democracies rarely fight, not that they never fight. In social science it is probably impossible to generate laws with 100% accuracy. Thus the correct formulation of the democratic peace proposition is the statement that democracies almost never go to war with one another.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn94" rel="nofollow">94</a></em><br />
<em>Second, many of the cases cited do not qualify as &quot;wars&quot; between &quot;democracies.&quot; A closer examination of the conflicts in question reveals that the apparent exceptions do not refute the democratic peace proposition. In some cases, one of the participants was not a democracy. In 1812, Britain was not a democracy. Spain''s democratic credentials in 1898 were dubious. Germany in 1914 was not governed by liberal principles and its foreign policy was directed by the Kaiser, not the elected Reichstag.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn95" rel="nofollow">95</a> In other cases, no international war took place. The American Civil War was not an international war. Finland engaged in virtually no direct hostilities with the Western allies during World War Two; it fought almost entirely against communist Russia.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/ISP_AmerDem#fn96" rel="nofollow">96</a></em><br />
<em>Third, the criticism that democracies have fought one another is irrelevant to deciding whether the United States should export democracy. The spread of democracy makes sense as long as democracies are significantly less likely to go to war with one another. A policy of spreading democracy would be justified if democracies have, for example, avoided war 99.9% of the time; we can decide to spread democracy without debating whether the figure is 99.9% or 100%.</em><br />

<em><strong>Iranians want internet</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Bagherpour and Soleimani, 11</strong> – Voice of America’s Persian News Network research analysts. Amir and Roya (Voice of America’s Persian News Network research analysts</em>jh), 7/22/11, “Oppression 2.0: Iranian Discontent in Cyberspace” for PBS <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/07/oppression-20-iranian-discontent-in-cyberspace.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/07/oppression-20-iranian-discontent-in-cyberspace.html</a><br />
The state of Iranian cyberspace is yet another example of the repressive relationship between the Islamic Republic's government and the people of Iran. A <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=664" rel="nofollow">report</a> by Freedom House this April ranked Iran last in regards to Internet freedom. This dismal ranking is based on Iran's &quot;extensive and sophisticated methods of control,&quot; which include &quot;tampering with Internet access, mobile-telephone service, and satellite broadcasting; hacking opposition and other critical websites; monitoring dissenters online and using the information obtained to intimidate and arrest them.&quot; Yet in spite of the severe restrictions on web usage, Iranians have remained resilient in their attempts to voice their political opinions in the world of social media -- to a degree far greater than is possible in their everyday lives offline. While institutionalized repression precedes the strict government Internet censorship that followed the disputed 2009 presidential vote, a 2008 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2008/Mapping_Irans_Online_Public" rel="nofollow">study</a> by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society cited Iran's blogosphere as the fourth largest in world, with an estimated 60,000 blogs or more.<br />
According to the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://opennet.net/research/profiles/iran" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Open Net Initiative</a> and the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://data.worldbank.org/country/iran-islamic-republic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">World Bank</a>, the number of Iranian Internet users has grown sharply: a nation that had fewer than one million Internet users in 2005 had 23 million only three years later, setting Iran miles ahead of its Middle Eastern neighbors. The most recent available statistics are from 2009, when 38.3 percent of the Iranian population had access to the Internet. But since that year and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's disputed reelection, the Iranian regime has revved up its oppressive tactics, targeting those who express independent voices of dissent via cyberspace. While Iran has attempted to enhance broadband penetration in the country, regulatory policies and censorship actions keep household and public Internet speed at a snail's pace to restrict multimedia downloads and high-speed services. Out of fear that people will organize through social media and other platforms, the regime continues to block, filter, and censor content that has the potential to connect and empower Iranians.<br />
No longer a nebulous buzzword, social media is now part of the modern lexicon. Webster's defines it as any form of electronic communication that creates online communities to share information, ideas, and personal content. Similar to older forms of communication such as television, radio, and print, it too can be used for various purposes ranging from basic entertainment to a catalyst for political change. It can be used to promote trade, innovation, even peace itself, or it can be employed to advocate hatred and terrorism.<br />

Yet, there is one option that might prove a highly efficient way of supporting the green movement while avoiding any direct entanglement into Iran's affairs: bombarding the country with high-speed internet access.</em><br />
<em>The internet is a key element in the events currently unfolding in Iran. What has been dubbed the &quot;Twitter revolution&quot; makes extensive use of social networking platforms to disseminate the movement's messages and organise protests. In a country where fair journalistic reporting has become impossible because of government restrictions, Iran's citizen-journalists have used internet resources to provide the world with images of government violence. Similarly, the government seems to be aware of the power of images and information.</em><br />
<em>One of the pillars of its repressive policy has been media propaganda depicting protesters as vandals and stooges of foreign powers. In pursuing this policy, the government actively curtails alternative sources of information in the country (especially the BBC and VOA broadcasts in Persian), thoroughly filters sensitive websites used by protesters to communicate (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter etc) and reduces internet speed to just about nil to render video streaming or uploading impossible. It has even <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/164591ba-16a2-11df-aa09-00144feab49a.html" rel="nofollow">moved to ban Gmail</a>.</em><br />
<em>The technology to overcome this already exists. Households and businesses in areas with poor infrastructure <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet" rel="nofollow">connect to the internet</a> through satellites. A Japanese satellite, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/winds/index_e.html" rel="nofollow">Kizuna</a>, was launched in 2008 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.betanews.com/article/New-Japanese-satellite-could-boost-Internet-speeds/1203970459" rel="nofollow">to provide mountainous areas</a> of Japan and other parts of East Asia with the world's highest-speed internet connection using 45cm aperture antennas (the same size as existing communications satellite antennas widely used in Iran). The Japanese intend to expand this project into an international one.</em><br />
<em>A number of satellites currently covering Iran's territory can be used to provide internet access. Indeed, the US army, through private subcontractors, successfully <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/new-satellite-internet-service-offered-to-soldiers-in-afghanistan-135821.php" rel="nofollow">provides its troops</a> in Iraq and Afghanistan (where infrastructure is poor or inexistent) with near-high-speed satellite access.</em><br />
<em>The policy framework for such an endeavour is also in place in the US. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=ade0393f-ec45-31ee-ac02-d682e4172703" rel="nofollow">Congress passed</a> a rather secretive bill dubbed the Voice Act (Victims of Iranian Censorship) last summer. Most of its multimillion dollar appropriation has been earmarked &quot;to expand Farsi language broadcasting into Iran&quot;. However, it involves a $20m budget for the &quot;development of technologies that will enhance the Iranian people's ability to access and share information; counter efforts to block, censor, or monitor the internet in Iran; and engage in internet-based education programmes and other exchanges online&quot;.</em><br />
<em>President Barack Obama signed the act into law last October, but it is unclear if unrestricted internet access for Iranians is one of Washington's priorities at the moment. It should be. Showering Iran with satellite internet would allow Iranians to efficiently fight the regime's monopoly over information, further weakening its legitimacy. This in turn will grow the ranks of the green movement, as more citizens will be able to compare the state media with other sources, and it promises to deepen the rift within the regime itself and among the rank-and-file of the security apparatus. It will allow the Iranian citizen-journalists to wider circulate images and videos of government violence, and coordinate more efficiently their demonstrations.</em><br />
<em>This would be an invaluable help for a movement that the government can currently easily hinder with telecommunication cuts in the wake of large demonstrations. Most importantly, and from a US policy perspective, it would empower Iranians without committing troops or confronting the Iranian regime directly, solving the dilemma of American non-interference.</em><br />

The Israeli ambassador to Cairo and about eighty other Israelis flew out of Cairo to Tel Aviv on a military plane under cover of darkness. They were lucky to escape with their lives. A huge crowd had attacked the Israeli embassy, overpowering the ninety police on duty, storming into several rooms and throwing files out into the street. The military officers now ruling the country have declared an emergency. Some days ago, Palestinian terrorists from Gaza disguised themselves in Egyptian uniforms and crossed Egyptian territory to attack southern Israel. In the firefight the terrorists and eight Israelis were killed, but so were five Egyptian border guards whom the Israelis identified wrongly. The Muslim Brothers refuse to accept this as the sort of mistake that occurs all too easily in such circumstances, and they have whipped up this crisis in order to break off the treaty that has kept the peace with Israel since 1979. This is a repeat of the earlier row that also originated from Gaza. Turkish Islamists were determined to run the blockade imposed by Israel to prevent the smuggling of weapons to Hamas. Israeli commandos boarded the incoming ship, and in the ensuing fracas killed nine Turkish Islamists. The Israeli government refused to apologize for this act of self-defense, whereupon Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan declared the Israeli ambassador to Ankara persona non grata. Two major Muslim countries have simultaneously experienced, or engineered, a diplomatic confrontation with Israel. On another front, Hamas has its headquarters in Damascus. In the light of the massacres committed daily by the Syrian security forces, Hamas seems to be about to move its headquarters to Cairo. In that case, Hamas may be able to mobilize popular support in Egypt for future terrorism against Israel, greatly inhibiting Israel’s counter-terror options. Later this month the United Nations will be pursuing a two-track anti-Israel policy, voting on the establishment of a Palestinian state, and on a resolution that Israel is uniquely racist. Iranian President Ahmedinejad has promised that he will be attending in New York to make his familiar speech about the imminent genocide of all Jews. Quite possibly all this is posturing, but it is beginning to look as if the Arab Spring is the fancy description of another dire round of self-destruction.<br />

<em>The leadership of the Green Movement, such as it was, made a decision in 2009 that they were going to hollow out the system -- as opposed to confronting it with daily demonstrations -- through defections and pressure on the system. And gradually through such delegitimization, they believed the Islamic Republic would weaken. That's a decision they've made, and to some extent that has been successful. Iran has a presidency that is hobbled and the regime is isolated from its constituents. Nonetheless, the regime remains in power. I can't believe, at the end of the day, that Iran can remain an oasis of autocratic stability in a changing region where the population is becoming much more aware of their rights and are trying to reclaim their rights.</em><br />
<em>I think you can trace the origins of the 'Arab Spring' to June 2009 in Iran, where you had a protest movement with nebulous leadership, that relied on social media to mobilize support. Therefore, what began in Iran, I suspect, will come back to Iran at some point. I don't think the idea of popular protest has been left behind in the Islamic Republic. What will trigger that, I don't know.

<em>The massive rise of popular protests around the Middle East and North Africa coincided with the convening of the World Social Forum in Dakar, Senegal. While the former were the subject of deserved and extensive media attention, the latter was virtually ignored by mainstream media. Yet all these gatherings of activists should be seen as part of a single, global movement that has been unfolding for over a decade.</em><br />
<em>While protesters in Egypt seek to topple corrupt and authoritarian rulers, activists at the World Social Forum have been doing the long-term and painstaking work of building a global movement to transform the basic structures of our world economy. It is those structures that enable the greed and brutality of individual leaders while maintaining the conditions against which Egyptians, Jordanians, Yemenis as well as Ecuadorans, Indians, and Detroiters are all resisting.</em><br />
<em>A new regime in Egypt will not fundamentally reduce youth unemployment. New leadership in Jordan will not solve the global climate crisis. Changes in local and national governments, without larger structural changes, will not end the land speculation, corporate monopolies, and militarization that plague communities worldwide.</em><br />
<em>While we must support the protests in the Middle East, it is vital that we see how they are connected to other struggles, including the massive protests last fall across Europe as well as the larger and more inclusive global justice movement that has created the World Social Forum process.</em><br />
<em>In <span style="color: #005588;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/70670" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a recent analysis</a></span> of the Egyptian protests, Horace Campbell identifies the most important characteristics of these “21st century revolutions”:</em><br />
<em>The revolutions are made by ordinary people independent of vanguard parties and self-proclaimed revolutionaries;</em><br />
<em>They are network-based and are developing innovative tools and technologies to foster autonomous, horizontal, and cooperative networks;</em><br />
<em>They are led by ordinary people who have taken initiative and stepped up to contribute to the movement’s self-mobilization and its effort at self-emancipation;They rely on and seek to build revolutionary non-violence for self-defense;Their ultimate revolutionary idea is for a world where human beings can live in dignity and freedom from dictatorship and violence</em><br />
<em>What is most amazing about these features of protests in the Middle East and North Africa is that they have been part of popular struggles around the world for quite some time. Indeed, these characteristics can be found in large quantities at the World Social Forum in Dakar, and they have helped shape and sustain countless local and national social forums over the past decade.</em><br />
<em>As governments and empires use force to maintain their preferred world order, another world is being created and nurtured “from below.” We must recognize the many forms the revolution of the 21st century takes and support it in all of its manifestations.</em><br />

<em>Have the non-violent pro-democracy movements of the Arab Spring destroyed the appeal of the violent ideology that motivated the 9/11 attacks?

The millions of Arabs involved have neither burned American and Western flags nor blamed the West for their predicament. </span><em>The region’s pro-democracy surge killed the myth of Arab exceptionalism, according to the FT’s Gideon Rachman, but also demonstrated the need for political reform to be home-grown and locally-owned:</em> <span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif';">The “Arab spring” has provided support for the neoconservative notion that the Arab world could not – and should not – be exempt from a global trend towards democracy.

<em><strong><span style="color: black;">Solves global democracy </span></strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Mostafa, 11.</strong> - Professor of International Relations, cairo U Nadia (Professor of International Relations, at the Political Science Department, Faculty of Economics &amp; Political Science, Cairo University, Founding Director of Center for Civilizational Studies and Dialogue of Cultures</em>jh), 3/16/11, “Beyond Western Paradigms of International Relations Towards an Islamic Perspective on Global Democracy” Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association Annual Conference &quot;Global Governance: Political Authority in Transition&quot;<br />
Reconceptualisation of global democracy beyond Western notions is needed. If global democracy is to be truly global, then theoretical mapping of the idea cannot be limited to Western literature and Western experiences. Otherwise there is a unilateral hegemony, which is itself highly undemocratic. Building a concept of global democracy must therefore include non-Western others, including Muslim thought. Islam offers a possible alternative frame of reference that sees global democracy from a different angle. It should be stressed that Islam and democracy are not in contradiction. On the contrary, Islam has a rich tradition of thinking about democracy, although it encompasses various schools of thought. Hence there is no more a single Islamic idea of democracy than there is a single Western approach. In addition, Islamic scholarship has long engaged with international dimensions and contexts of democracy. Thus the problem is not that Islam has no ideas to contribute to debates about global democracy, but that these notions have so far not spread beyond the narrow confines of Islamic studies to wider social enquiry. An Islamic paradigm of global democracy could highlight six main points. First, the religion of Islam provides an account of the human condition that can underpin a commitment to global democracy. Islam posits that people everywhere on earth share common possibilities and challenges of being human, a shared experience that provides foundations for a global demos. Second, the Islamic notion of al-‘Umma (the community of faith) offers a nonterritorial alternative to the nation-state as a basis for collective identity and solidarity in global politics. The concept of the Umma underlines the principle that ‘the people’ in a democracy do not have to be bound to a particular country. Members of a demos can – as in the case of the Muslim community – be spread across the whole of the planet. Indeed, third, Islam emphasises the notion of a global community of humanity, regardless of faith.The idea of the Umma could, on a certain reading of the Qur’an (the Islamic Holy Book) and the Sunnah (the sayings and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad) be stretched to encompass a unity of humankind. Fourth, Islam contributes to conceptions of global democracy with its recognition of and respect for diversity in this global community. Islam regards diversity in humanity as a result of divine wisdom. Global democracy is tasked with providing a governance frame for the peaceful coexistence of difference. Fifth, Islam highlights the interconnection of global democracy and global justice. Islamic ethics hold that only those who are capable of bringing about positive change towards social justice are entitled to power in global affairs. Peaceful coexistence of difference is not sustainable in a situation of intolerable global inequalities. Sixth, where undemocratic global power works against global justice, Islam prescribes resistance by Jihad (‘struggle’). This struggle can take a wide range of forms, both peaceful and forceful. A major debate among Muslims in contemporary struggles for global democracy is how best to wage jihad in the defence of human rights and self-determination, particularly when powerful anti-democratic forces are so ready to employ violent coercion backed by talk of a ‘clash of civilizations’. In sum, then, Islam can contribute to conceptions of global democracy with its concentration on the human condition, its ideas of nonterritorial community, its strivings for intercultural harmony, its insistence on social justice, and its recognition of the need for struggle to achieve a just global democracy. These ideas can combine with other visions from the global south to offer wider and richer conceptions of global democracy than those provided by western political thought alone.<br />

<strong>Internet key</strong><br />

The internet is inherently a force for democracy. That will not necessarily always be true, but it is the case today, given its present architecture and the way that people use the network.<br />
Uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia and across the Middle East and North Africa this month offer the most recent manifestation of the power of the use of internet. To start with the obvious limitations of the argument: no technology will make people take to the streets. There must be a reservoir of anger at the state of affairs and desire to improve society. There must be baseline levels of literacy, education, infrastructure and technological skill among would-be protestors, and so forth. With these conditions present, the use of the internet cuts in favour of democracy.<br />
The clearest evidence in favour of this premise is that the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, faced with protesters in the streets of Cairo who were actively using social media to co-ordinate and project their efforts on the ground, decided he would shut down the network altogether. As the story goes, Mr Mubarak placed six phone calls to the big internet service providers and mobile telecommunications companies and told them to shut down the network. Researchers have shown that his shutdown was largely effective as a technical matter: network traffic dropped 90% or more. But Mr Mubarak's gambit failed.<br />
The key facts are not those related to the ultimate outcome of the story. We should focus neither on the fact that the network came back up, nor on the fact that Mr Mubarak's regime fell. The crucial fact is that, when decision-time came, Mr Mubarak did not seek to use the network to his advantage. He decided that it was better for him, as he sought to cling to power, to take the tools away from the protesters. If the internet fundamentally somehow favours autocrats over dissidents, Mr Mubarak would have made a different decision in his moment of crisis.<br />
Leaders across the Middle East and North Africa have reason to empathise with Mr Mubarak. The most distinctive feature of the use of the internet and digital media in the past few months is the regional nature of the protests. One of the most important ways in which the internet favours those who seek to advance democracy is the effect of people in one geographic location seeing clearly what is happening elsewhere in their region. This particular story is still unfolding. After dramatic events in Tunisia and Egypt, people are in the streets in Libya and Bahrain. Smaller, sympathetic protests are taking place throughout the region and in social spaces online. Part of what is powerful about the network is the connection of people who share a common language and relationships to their state, religion and social norms. (Autocrats presumably might use social media to connect with one another and to co-ordinate their resistance, but their numbers are, of course, much smaller.<br />

<em>More than 2 billion people worldwide now have some degree of access to the Internet, a figure that has doubled over the past five years. Yet while the Internet is emerging as an increasingly powerful tool for political activism, governments around the world are also becoming more expert at controlling electronic communication. As part of the U.S. effort to defend freedom of speech and expression throughout the globe, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has asserted the Administration’s dedication to Internet freedom time and time again. Actions, however, speak louder than words. U.S. Agencies and Appropriations It took the State Department more than three years to allocate the $50 million given to the department by Congress for its global Internet freedom efforts. In this year’s Continuing Resolution, Congress gave another $20 million to the State Department and $10 million to the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to further pursue their Internet freedom agendas. This time around, the funding must move more speedily and efficiently to invest in proven technologies and fill gaps in private-sector investment. At the same time, the U.S. government should call attention to those countries that are the worst perpetrators of Internet censorship. These offenses are already recorded in the State Department’s Annual Human Rights Report to Congress. Internet Freedom’s Worst Offenders In January, Freedom House released “Freedom on the Net 2011: A Global Assessment of the Internet and Digital Media,” examining Internet freedom in 37 countries across the globe.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2011/06/Freedom-of-Speech-on-the-Internet-US-Must-Improve-Outreach-Effort#_edn1" rel="nofollow">[1</a>] Most of the worst offenders are no surprise. At the top of the list were: Iran, Burma, Cuba, China, Tunisia, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Belarus, Bahrain, and Thailand. The report shows that threats to Internet freedom continue to grow. In 19 of the 37 countries examined, the Internet was subject to some degree of centralized control. In Egypt, for example, the decision of the government to completely shut down the Internet for five days in the midst of political upheaval and protests this past January showed the power of such centralized control. Further, in 12 out of the 37 countries examined, officials imposed repeated blocks or bans on popular social networking and media sharing sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Bloggers and other Internet users were arrested in 23 of the 27 nations, while activists’ networks were targeted or under surveillance in at least 12 countries. Freedom House is not the only one tracking the perpetrators of cyber repression. Each year on World Day Against Cybercensorship, March 12, Reporters without Borders publishes its own list of “Internet enemies.”<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2011/06/Freedom-of-Speech-on-the-Internet-US-Must-Improve-Outreach-Effort#_edn2" rel="nofollow">[2</a>] Citing many of the same top offenders, this year Reporters without Borders highlighted the oppressive cyber policies of Burma, China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. As of March of this year, these countries had some 119 netizens behind bars—China, Vietnam, and Iran being the worst offenders. Disconcertingly, the mass Web-filtering tools used by Middle Eastern and North African governments are often created by Western companies. According to a recent report by the OpenNet Initiative, a collaborative effort between several universities dedicated to exposing and analyzing Internet filtering operations, McAfee, Websense, Blue Coat Systems, Palo Alto Networks, and Netsweeper have all sold their Web-filtering systems to repressive regimes that use these products to censor Web content. Websense has publicized a clear policy that it “does not sell to governments or Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that are engaged in government-imposed censorship,” but it has sold a product to Yemen that filters content and also prevents users from disguising their identity from monitors. In defense of their actions, these companies argue that they have no control over how clients use their products, just as a car company does not have responsibility for how people operate its vehicles. While at some level this argument seems reasonable, it does not account for the fact that many of these companies have not only provided the regimes with the requisite software, but also continually update the list of URLs that are filtered through the program. This updating has an immediate effect on the information that entire nations of people can access. Slow to Act In February, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reasserted the Department of State’s dedication to Internet freedom, committing to “a comprehensive and innovative approach—one that matches our diplomacy with our technology, secure distribution networks for tools and direct support for those on the front lines.”<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2011/06/Freedom-of-Speech-on-the-Internet-US-Must-Improve-Outreach-Effort#_edn3" rel="nofollow">[3</a>] The actions of the department, however, have not fully matched this commitment. While the State Department dragged its feet on doling out its funding, the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) stepped up. With its modest amount of funding—$1.5 million—the BBG gave a grant to the Global Internet Freedom Consortium, run by the Chinese-exiled Falun Gong religious sect, specializing in developing and deploying anti-censorship technologies. The Global Internet Freedom Consortium supports the proliferation of the anti-censorship programs Ultrareach and Freegate, just two of the proven circumvention technologies on the market. Within the Department of State, however, $28 million of the total $50 million received by the State Department for promoting Internet freedom remained unallocated until May of this year. Noting this fact, Congress gave the department only $20 million in fiscal year 2011 and gave the BBG another $10 million. State has since announced its plans to allocate the funds “like venture capitalists,”<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2011/06/Freedom-of-Speech-on-the-Internet-US-Must-Improve-Outreach-Effort#_edn4" rel="nofollow">[4</a>] offering grants to fund the further development of circumvention technologies and to help train activists fighting cyber repression across the globe. Congress should continue to hold State to this commitment. Further U.S. Action Needed The Administration should: Spend Internet freedom funds wisely. Funds to support Internet freedom ought to be efficiently directed toward providing an incentive for private companies to design more effective firewall circumvention technologies. The BBG has enjoyed a degree of success in funding the Global Internet Freedom Consortium. Speak out against Internet freedom’s worst offenders. The U.S. should continue to unequivocally condemn nations who jail citizens for communicating on the net. Offenses can be recorded in the Annual Human Rights Report. The U.S. should let every nation know that its status as a free nation depends not only on its human rights record but also on the degree to which it restricts freedom of expression over the Web. Encourage other nations to join a coalition, which could provide the venue for “naming and shaming” offenders. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) provides a model for voluntary inter-governmental cooperation. Its purpose is combating money laundering and terrorist financing, and it encourages the development of national and international policies in member nations. An international Internet Freedom Task Force could similarly encourage the protection of freedom of expression on the Internet. It is time for the State Department to end the empty promises and stop hoarding scarce funds. The U.S. must act in defense of global Internet freedom.</em><br />

<em>At the annual meeting of the Community of Democracies last month in Lithuania, Secretary of State Hillary <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">Clinton struck a characteristic note of cautious idealism in support of Internet users living under repressive governments: “Because technology both empowers and endangers your work, we are giving activists new tools to try to circumvent the many obstacles that governments are putting in your way.”</span> In a February speech Clinton gave at George Washington University, she said roughly the same thing: “There is a debate currently underway in some circles about whether the Internet is a force for liberation or repression. … [We] support a burgeoning group of technologists and activists working at the cutting edge of the fight against Internet repression.” This is complicated, Clinton finds new ways to say with every speech, but we’re doing all the right things. <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">Official U.S. policy unequivocally favors a “free and open Internet” and opposes repressive censorship regimes worldwide through the best available means.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">But, in reality, this isn’t exactly true. An examination of the State Department’s record of its 18-month-old Internet freedom agenda reveals significant failures</span>, both <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">in</span> overall <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">funding</span> efforts and in the omission of vital tools from its approach to helping activists crack through the layers of censorship imposed by repressive regimes. <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">Before democracy advocates abroad can truly take heart in Clinton’s words, the department needs to admit to past mistakes and adopt a truly comprehensive approach to addressing the issue.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">FRUSTRATION WITH THE State Department’s sluggishness in allocating funds to address Internet freedom issues has simmered for some time</span>. As far back as January 2010, a bipartisan group of five senators wrote to Clinton demanding greater accountability for the department’s funding process, and, at a March 2010 press conference, Senator Sam Brownback threatened to place holds on State nominees if swifter action wasn’t taken. He declared, “The stakes are too high for bureaucracy and excuses.” That same month, <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">Internet freedom activist and former ambassador to Hungary Mark Palmer testified before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, arguing that he had “never been more appalled at the State Department’s refusal to do what is so clearly in the national interest of the United States.”</span></em><br />
<em>Part of the problem is that <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">the State Department has simply been slow to spend the money that certain zealous members of Congress have allocated to their pet cause. </span>In the aftermath of Clinton’s February speech, <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">critics in the press noted the department’s failure to distribute approximately $30 million in Internet freedom funds, despite receiving dozens of grant proposals for many times that amount.</span> Indeed, <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">in 2010, the department was allocated $30 million to promote Internet freedom, but the fact sheet accompanying Clinton’s February speech said the department issued just over $5 million in grants the previous year.</span> This spring, State officials further annoyed their congressional overseers by reducing their requested Internet freedom funding from $10 million to zero <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">for Fiscal Year 2012</span>. The request was overruled by <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">Congress</span>, which <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">allocated $20 million in dedicated Internet freedom funding.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">Another large point of contention is the State Department’s decisionmaking regarding which new technologies to fund—and which to exclude from funding</span>. In June, The New York Times published a long story extolling the department’s efforts in funding the development of “mesh network” technology—sometimes also referred to as “the Internet in a suitcase”—designed to bypass the government-monitored Internet by creating alternative local networks that connect devices directly. The technology can be used to quickly create large local area networks within a city, but it doesn’t solve the problem of bypassing state-run firewalls to connect with the broader Internet from within a censored nation. Rather than extol this partial victory, however, many Internet freedom activists were furious, regarding the Times story as further confirmation that their preferred technology—“circumvention software” that allows users to get around the firewalls of oppressive regimes—was once against getting the cold shoulder from the department.</em><br />
<em>Indeed, <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">a substantial fractionof Clinton’s critics have focused on the department’s failure to support specific anti-censorship “circumvention” technology</span>. Senator Dick Lugar and <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">others</span>, including high-profile journalists Jackson Diehl and Anne Applebaum of The Washington Post and Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times, <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">have championed the cause of a group called the Global Internet Freedom Consortium. A prominent alliance of software companies that has repeatedly sought and been denied State Department funding, the group includes the makers of several Internet censorship circumvention tools like Ultrasurf and Freegate, sophisticated pieces of software that allow users to bypass Internet restrictions like China’s “Great Firewall” to visit blocked sites while masking their own IP addresses.</span> Proponents of the technology cite claims of nearly one million daily users worldwide and say that the GIFC is constrained only by its small budget, which forces it to make tough choices when surges in demand, as during the 2009 Iranian protests, exceed the limited capacity of its servers. With sufficient funding, according to supporters including Lugar and The Washington Post editorial board, the GIFC could expand to serve hundreds of millions of Internet users under repressive regimes.</em><br />

However, some critics such as former U.S. Senator Sam Brownback (R-KA) argue that <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/02/137227.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">none of the funding </a>has actually reached the firewall-busting firms that form the Global Internet Freedom Consortium and are considered the most effective in helping users surmount the firewall.<br />
Are other states controlling the Internet so strenuously? Many other states limit or even forbid access to the Internet. The ONI says Iran also &quot;continues to expand&quot; its already <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://opennet.net/research/profiles/iran" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">extensive Internet censorship system</a>, using a sophisticated filtering network to counter the rapid growth of Farsi-language blogs and websites.

Bambauer says China's efforts at censorship are being watched closely by other closed societies. &quot;We think absolutely that China is a model. It's certainly a model for Vietnam, for Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan, especially when you consider that China sells bandwidth to other states, outsourcing censorship.&quot;<br />
Are there ways of circumventing Chinese controls?

Additionally, media reports from China and the statements of dissidents indicate that many things targeted for censorship do get through government filters. Virtual private networks (VPN) or Internet proxies are also relatively <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTOE60P0A120100128" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">accessible within China (Reuters)</a> and allow Internet-savvy citizens to access blocked pages.<br />

&quot;GIFC is an organization run by elements of the Falun Gong cult, which is bent on vilifying the Chinese government with fabricated lies, undermining Chinese social stability and sabotaging China-U.S. relations,&quot; said Wang Baodong, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington. &quot;We're strongly opposed to the U.S. government providing whatever assistance to such an anti-China organization.&quot;<br />
The decision to fund GIFC followed a three-year lobbying campaign by Washington insiders, congressional pressure and opposition from some human rights advocates and Internet experts. It was also controversial within the Obama administration, sources said, despite the commitment of <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Barack_Obama" rel="nofollow">President Obama</a> and Secretary of State <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton" rel="nofollow">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> to Internet freedom.<br />
Some officials worried that Beijing would view as a hostile act U.S. financial support for a group that China says has agitated for the overthrow of its government. Others were concerned the funds would get in the way of the Obama administration's broader engagement with China on issues as varied as climate change, the global financial crisis and efforts to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation in North Korea and Iran.<br />

<br />
Much of the growth and prosperity of the Pacific Rim countries in general – ranging from Japan and China through Southeast Asia to the United States and the Pacific Coast of South America – depends on peace and stability in East Asia. The United States and China must lead other nations in fostering this peace and stability. Today, this means cooperating on such varied issues as the potential nuclear threat of North Korea, the resolution of the China-Taiwan controversy and the exploration of – and safety of sea lanes through – the South China Sea, the superhighway of the Southeast Asian economic miracle. These matters will recur, and other problems unforeseen today will turn up, in the years ahead. So the world spins. To be sure, cooperation often will not be easy, for fear as to Chinese intentions pervades Washington and suspicions of U.S. motives remain widespread here in China. Americans, for example, are particularly concerned at the size of the Chinese military budget and what Beijing intends to do with its modernized and expanded military capacity. Thus as Mr. Perry noted, increasing contacts between the militaries of the two countries, and each nation's clearer understanding of the defense policies and strategic intentions of the other, are essential. This was the particular importance of Mr. Perry's visit to the PLA gathering, a type of exchange both sides must foster in the future for everyone's good. Short-term issues are not necessarily unimportant because they are short-term, but they must be worked out by each side having consistent policies the other can understand that look beyond short-term problems to longer-term interests. The high probability is that the United States and China will be the two superpowers of the early 21st century and our living together in peace will be <span style="text-decoration: none;">essential to</span> the prosperity if not the survival of the world.<br />

<strong>War escalates</strong><br />
<span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">The Strait Times, 2000</span>[“No one gains in war over Taiwan”, June 25, Lexis]<br />
<span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">The high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then</span> <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';"> -horror of horrors -</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">raise the possibility of a nuclear war</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate,</span> <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">east Asia will be set on fire</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order.</span> <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">. In south Asia,</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confrsonted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability,</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;"> there is little hope of winning a war against China</span> <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">50 years later,</span> <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">short of using nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass,</span> <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">we would see the destruction of civilization</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a</span> <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">nuclear Armageddon over Taiwan</span> <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">might seem inconceivable, it</span> <span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif'; text-decoration: none;">cannot be ruled out entirely</span><span style="font-family: 'georgia','serif';">, for China puts sovereignty above everything else. </span><br />

 Why are debaters so obsessed with nukes? This aff, like nearly every aff at this tournament, buys into the framework of nuclearism by allowing nuclear weapons to shape their discussion of policy – this focus on nukes prevents action against them.<br />
<br />
Chaloupka 1992 – <span style="color: black;">Professor and Chair of the department of political science at Colorado State University (William, “Knowing Nukes: the politics and culture of the atom,” University of Minnesota Press, 1992. p 1-2, CMR) italics by author </span><br />
<br />
Like few other issues, nuclearism strains to become more than an instance. It aspires to be context and case, to shape public and private life. It seeks a symbolic position of such force that other concerns would arise within the context of nuclear technology, sometimes even when explicit connections are absent. The policies, practices, and discourses of nuclear technology seem to have a capacity to capture attention that rivals even their destructive capability. In short, nuclearism organizes public life and thought so thoroughly that, in another era of political theory, we would analyze it as an ideology. The framework of &quot;survival&quot; or &quot;defense&quot; has become pervasive in Western political cultures, dominating not only the budgets and debates of public life but the more private dimensions as well. In our time, when one dreams of public life, the fantasies may even be atomic.<br />
The level of compulsion attendant to nuclear questions could become a subject of interpretation; a critic could choose to discuss these questions as more fundamental than issues that merely confirm existing frameworks and habits. For citizens of nuclear states, nukes are the metaphors for success and failure, the constraints for experimentation, the analogy for all other &quot;problems.&quot; Nonetheless, these same citizens seem reluctant to take nukes so seriously. The background for my project is a suspicion that a sort of conservatism, a slowness to move, characterizes even the most alarmist talk of nukes. The various positions on nuclearism are phrased within familiar political ways of speaking, despite their proponents' considered judgment that precisely these understandings have made the world so different, so dangerous. The nuclearism adopted by states and diplomats presumes a Machiavellian counterbalance of threats, while opponents presume the efficacy of humanist commitment. Despite obvious differences, both positions reinforce contemporary, ideological ways of understanding politics.<br />
Still, there may be openings, hints of recognition that nuclearism is a pattern of its own, not subsumed by existing politics. As the story about Richland High in my introduction might suggest, there are new ways available to think about nuclearism, approaches not yet exhausted by the enormity of the topic. Specifically, there is a lively intellectual approach that has taken a special interest in the question of nuclearism. <em>Diacritics,</em> a major journal of literary criticism, published the symposium that gave this approach the name &quot;nuclear criticism.&quot; Major figures such as Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Jean Baudrillard have used nukes explicitly as instances of their work, and many other authors have addressed nuclearism in the context of discussions about texts, discourses, and authority.<br />
But, as predictable as a contemporary intellectual's interest in nuclearism might be, there are resistances to remember as well. Nuclearism turns back on such intellectual efforts, carrying special implications and challenges for them, as do only a few other political concerns.1 Given the generally perceived seriousness of nukes, the playfulness and studied irreverence of the language approach seem blatantly inappropriate. Nuclearism obviously confronts deconstruction's critique of totalities, of global ways of understanding politics. Political talk of nukes, on all sides, constantly moves to universalistic levels, almost as if there were a collective wish to replace totalities that no longer hold the spell they once did. Nuclear criticism clearly (or, as Derrida notes, nu-clearly) raises a range of other possibilities. In short, I am trying to portray nuclearism and textual/interpretive approaches as key examples of each other, as an intersection where difference produces previously unclaimed space for political action.<br />
In this chapter, I begin to map that intersection by examining a key universalism contained in most of the politics that engage issues of nuclearism. Survival is a coded position that privileges certain questions and marginalizes others. In this chapter, I want to make aspects of that privilege more explicit, more accessible to controversy. Assigning &quot;survival&quot; the status of summary and goal implies a relatively settled &quot;humanity&quot; that is, one hopes, to survive. One would hardly need to hope that people not survive to bring that code into question (although some radically misanthropic environmentalists playfully take just such a position). Savvy about codes and symbols, the nuclear critic might begin by highlighting what our most universalistic survival codes assume.<br />

Nuclearism forces disciplinary power’s destructive control over populations<br />

<br />
It may be surprising, given the liberal basis of much nuclear opposition, that the issue of control is not one on which pro- and antinuke positions are always clearly distinguishable. Some nuclear opponents have used the threat of annihilation to <em>justify</em> control measures, arguing that the controls of the nuclear managers are inadequate. More often, of course, critics cite this control as a reason to eliminate nukes. Critics argue that the amount of citizen control necessary to secure the safety of nuclear civilization is so odious that nukes —rather than safeguards —should be foregone. Once again, we find ourselves in the middle of a strange political situation. Opponents argue for controls (intervening in plant siting proceedings and urging that similar procedures apply to weapon installations), but also use these controls as an argument against nukes. Nuclear managers justify widespread surveillance and disciplinary measures by their observation that the world is so very dangerous, but they then argue that deterrence has stabilized the world under their leadership, and that this action somehow relates to &quot;freedom.&quot; Repeatedly, the sign of the paradox presents itself as the characteristic sign of an era that strains to ignore those signs and to present a politics of values in response. Trying to master such awesome exercises as &quot;thinking the unthinkable,&quot; we are susceptible to seemingly small, even trivial, moves of power.<br />
Discipline, already at a huge advantage, conceals itself further. The shift of politics into techniques of control accumulates beneath this weighty umbrella of &quot;big&quot; concerns. Political micro controls parallel the claims of nuclear managers, adding stability to every power claim made on behalf of the state. On one level, disciplinary measures are the predictable accompaniment of having so many dangerous weapons and associated facilities. At this straightforward level, it would not be difficult to foresee the need for control. The most famous case of such foresight is probably Einstein's. Within a year after Hiroshima, he imagined a situation that &quot;[would] insidiously change men's lives more completely than did Hitler&quot;; &quot;To retain even a temporary security in an age of total war, government will have to secure total control. Restrictive measures will be required by the necessities of the situation, not through the conspiracy of willful men.<br />
Einstein was correct on oppression and conspiracy, but he was wrong on power. Nuclearism has found a way to spread that power throughout society <em>without acting.</em> This is Jean Baudrillard's notion of contemporary power. &quot;The nuclear threat is part of a 'soft' mode of extermination, bit by bit, by deterrence, not at all an apocalyptic term.&quot;47 Such power implodes and leukemizes, in Baudrillard's metaphors; its focus is inward. In this instance of power (which clarifies and exemplifies Foucault's controversial argument), there is no action, intention, or conspiracy. Never using its weapons —indeed, founded on the notion that the best force is never used —power can infect everything. It is discursive in the sense suggested by Derrida; this power is only spoken, never used. Outside history, beyond the world of things that have functions and uses, this is precisely poststructuralist power.<br />

Nuclear criticism is not vapid deconstruction but politically charged – necessary to challenge nuke’s textuality<br />
<br />
Chaloupka 1992 – <span style="color: black;">Professor and Chair of the department of political science at Colorado State University (William, “Knowing Nukes: the politics and culture of the atom,” University of Minnesota Press, 1992. p 18-19, CMR) italics by author </span><br />
<br />
As I suggested earlier, nuclear criticism presents a sort of solution for the language-and-politics position as well as for opponents of nukes. Critics accuse deconstruction of falling into a passive nihilism in its avoidance of substance and essence. Edward Said, for example, has criticized this &quot;retreat from [deconstruction's] constituency, the citizens of modern society&quot; in the strongest of terms, but from a position within literary criticism. 51 Nuclear criticism pushes poststructuralism away from its depoliticizing tendency (if that ever was a tendency) while it disproves the charge. The rebuttal is of a congenial form. Lodged firmly within a liberal discourse, nuclear opponents have seldom proceeded beyond a valuebased rejection. In the form of &quot;nuclear criticism,&quot; opponents can appropriate a genre specifically appropriate to this task, rejecting universalisms in a way that does not subsequently reconfirm an alternate universalism. This is precisely the language-and-politics project. And since the nuke's &quot;universalism&quot; is explicitly textual, the approaches of literary criticism are precisely appropriate.<br />
While the notions of survival and apocalypse push nuclear opponents in the direction of universalistic, liberal social theory, there are good reasons to reject that perspective. Poststructuralism is more than another take on domination; it is also a position on how that domination can be opposed and what roles its critics can credibly adopt. The special role of nuclear criticism, echoing Said's remarks on politics and broadening them to yet more aspects of public life, is to infuse the various poststructuralist positions with a concern for power. Whatever its faults, nuclear criticism will not leave its practitioners indifferent to the world and to their role as a threat to power, which is how Said has characterized the politics of literary criticism.52<br />
<br />
Our framework is that the judge evaluates language and power structures – this is logically prior to any political action and also crafts more effective action<br />

My reading works, then, on language-and-politics turf captured by Foucault. I am postulating a specific kind of intervention —one that politicizes by noting how language works, without forfeiting the next political response. Foucault claims this odd and important double move with a distinctive two-part challenge to power. Starting with the crisis of representation and character of language that sets that crisis off—shifting and turning away from either the self who uses it or the phenomenon it tries to capture —Foucault moved on to a description of rules and the ways those rules constitute a generally unrecognized realm of power in contemporary society.25 The two moves resonate, one exacerbating the other until legitimacy is drawn into the whirl of contested territory. Foucault's conception of language is what funds the possibility of political response, making it possible that such response is neither an arbitrary imposition, as has been charged, nor a promise of meaning and representation that cannot be fulfilled. Instead, the political response finds its form exactly at the point where old models of language break down. In Foucault's analysis, language holds a different position than we have long expected it to hold. Its mechanisms turn out to be just as reversible as any political interpretation (which is, of course, where that political reversibility begins). Language is ... freed from all of the old myths by which our awareness of words, discourse, and literature has been shaped. For a long time it was thought that language had mastery over time, that it acted both as the future bond of the promise and as memory and narrative; it was thought to be prophecy and history; it was also thought that in its sovereignty it could bring to light the eternal and visible body of truth; it was thought that its essence resided in the form of words or in the breath that made them vibrate. In fact, it is only a formless rumbling, a streaming; its power resides in its dissimulation.26 Rather than fulfilling the role of the master (bonding future promise to past memory, illuminating truth through words), language actually threatens that role. Dissimulation, waiting, and forgetting are more central to language than illuminating (arriving at something that can be illuminated). Its failures forgotten in the continuing stream (or discounted while we wait), language works by seeming to be what it cannot actually be. While it seems to promise clarity about a future it will encounter, language still never gets there; &quot;it is depthless forgetting and the transparent emptiness of waiting.&quot; Language, in its attentive and forgetful being, with its power of dissimulation that effaces every determinate meaning and even the existence of the speaker, in the gray neutrality that constitutes the essential hiding place of all being and thereby frees the space of the image —is neither truth nor time, neither eternity nor man; it is instead the always undone form of the outside.27 If language is &quot;neither eternity nor man,&quot; and is continually undone, it forms an oscillation, giving only momentary contact with either self or phenomenon. It is a continually &quot;undone&quot; form. Anyone who relies on such a form, which is to say anyone who speaks or writes, will find their positions brought into question, into the vertiginous gap Derrida calls the <em>aporia.</em> After all, every political claim originates in language. Furthermore, while the earlier, mistaken view of language that Foucault criticizes had granted a special role to the speaker—the author— this new position undermines the self. Neither originator of meaning nor dupe of a determined, exterior script, the self is constituted in a special way. By settling into &quot;neither truth nor time,&quot; language &quot;places the origin in contact with death, or rather brings them both to light in the flash of their infinite oscillation — a momentary contact in a boundless space.&quot;28 Rather than solidifying our relations with events and their sequences, language inserts oscillation, dissembly, memory, and waiting. The attempt to solidify foreign policy positions thus runs counter to what occurs within those positions, at their most fundamental levels. But instead of making politics impossible, our recognition of language's shifting, contradictory role enables responses, even if those responses will differ from those enabled by the Enlightenment.<br />

We could, at least, protest against the kind of selves produced in the modern era<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That </span>politics would be cultural, its standards more aesthetic than scientific<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It would be </span>an odd politics<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, because </span>it would not promise answers or any such certainty<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Solutions<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, whether mathematical or chemical, </span>would become less important as political metaphors,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and, contrary to the words of deconstruction's many critics, </span><strong>this would not be the end of politics.</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Examples of a better politics abound, available to anyone who has abandoned the &quot;solution&quot; metaphor. Indeed, there exists an argument that makes it </span>necessary<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not optional, </span>to identify &quot;solution&quot; talk as metaphorical, giving the fundamental option of discarding that metaphor to anyone who took all this very seriously<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That is to say, </span>identifying &quot;solution&quot; as a metaphor<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (and identifying other metaphors) </span>was not an evasion of the challenge —what's your solution? —but the main work<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>That which must be done to understand where we're at.<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is an important implication from that decision. </span>The political approach I have in mind would understand that power continues<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Any political stance based on rising expectations sometimes exaggerates promises.Revolution, transcendence, liberation —all those are dubious promises, producing a falsely certain future in whose name action is justified<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Postmodernism<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, then, </span><strong>clears ground for political action</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> —not acquiescence —when it </span>demonstrates that power will not somehow be rendered null, but will be the context of ongoing performance, exposure, release, and recapture<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The demise of promises of generalized liberation is hardly the end of politics. </span>Nordoes that demise even signal that politics has become unappealing, a matter to be avoided<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And </span>it certainly doesn't mean that liberation is now located in some other area<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong>There</strong> <strong><em>are</em> still struggles to expose oppression and discipline and surveillance</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>As power is increasingly deployed in ways that do not oppress or dominate, but create us as power's subjects, inscribing its practices into our disciplines and habits, strategies of response will change, not disappear.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And the </span>new responses will share an identifiable pattern.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Successful critique henceforth will come from those who can make what had seemed real, before they addressed it, now seem thoroughly problematic.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is my claim, then, </span>in response to every attempt to strain meaning from these opaque machines: <em>the computer and the robot are the metonymic processes we use to deal with the nuke</em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">If the nuke has seemed unspeakable, then, we may have been using a metonymy. </span>The computer and the robot<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—parts, implements, and artifacts of nuclearism —</span>compose a Lacanian trajectory of desire.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Displacing questions of censorship (and transgressive responses to its prohibitions) with possibilities of mastery, assimilation, and accomplishment, </span>we deal with Lacan's &quot;desire for something else,&quot; with metonymy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.29 </span>Programming the computer or robot, we have controlled the (uncontrollable) bomb<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Familiar with our personal silicon, we simulate some kind of familiarity with remote isotopes controlled by forces inaccessible to us<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>We<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have </span>walk<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ed, seemingly fearlessly, </span>into a (silicon) valley of doom prohibited to us.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As Deleuze and Guattari emphasize, this displacing process continually breaks away from the ego, canceling it with several identifiable processes</span>. The law tells us: You will not marry your mother, and you will not kill your father. And we docile subjects say to ourselves: so <em>that's</em> what I wanted!<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> . . . There we have a ... displacement. For what really takes place is that the law prohibits something that is perfectly fictitious in the order of desire or of the &quot;instincts,&quot; so as to persuade its subjects that they had the intention corresponding to this fiction.30 Deleuze and Guattari repeatedly use that exclamation —&quot;So that's what I wanted!&quot; —to bring a metonymy to the fore. This process can be applied to our discussion of nukes. </span>Faced with the Law, the egoistic expression of values, we exclaim, &quot;nobody could possibly want nuclear war.&quot; But, unmistakably war preparations are everywhere. The reverse logic of deterrence —the weird mission of preparing nukes never to be used — comes home to roost<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Desire breaks out of the censorship planned for it<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong>Even if nobody wants nuclear war, people are acting as if they do. So</strong> <strong><em>that's</em></strong> <strong>what I wanted</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">! In this way, </span>the simple repression ofnuclearism that liberal humanism tries to turn into a first value, a base agreement, twists out of control. A metonymy forms under the sign of the exclamation heard constantly in American political talk over the last forty years: &quot;Nuke 'em!<br />
<br />
<strong>And, no value in survival. Their constant striving for “survival” relies on a Nieztschean God – deconstruct this plz</strong><br />
<strong>Chaloupka 1992</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">–</span> <span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Professor and Chair of the department of political science at Colorado State University (William, “Knowing Nukes: the politics and culture of the atom,” University of Minnesota Press, 1992. p 3-4, CMR) italics by author </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Perhaps </span>the central political metaphor of antinuclearists involves the appeal to survival of the human species<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as a principle that can guide social and political response. But after Jonathan SchelPs </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Fate of the Earth </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">presented that case, the narrowness of this appeal began to draw criticism. As Robert Jay Lifton has noted, the emergence of neo-Nazi survivalists is not without consequence for nuclear opponents who have used the survival language so extensively themselves.3 Schell broadened his metaphors in </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Abolition,</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4 </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and nuclear opponents in general have tried to define survival in a way that is not individualist.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nonetheless, recent essays by political theorist George </span>Kateb<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> bring even that modified project into question, finding within the &quot;survival&quot; position an indefensible replacement totality.5 Kateb's critique </span>focuses on the political metaphysics implied by the survival position. To turn &quot;existence&quot; into a principle that could inform action is to ignore many other philosophical commitments<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> made in this century. The </span>metaphysical privileging of existence<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as key to a great and total meaning (that might motivate political action in a classically liberal framework) </span>is unavailable &quot;in an age when the death of God has been announced with adequate plausibility<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; 6</span><br />
Existence does not have systemic attributes amenable to univocal judgments<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. At least some of us cannot accept the validity of revelation, or play on ourselves the Kantian trick of regarding existence </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">as if </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">it were the designed work of a personal God, or presume to call it good, and bless it as if it were the existence we would have created if we had the power, and think that it therefore deserves to exist and is justifiable just as it is. No: these argumentative moves are bad moves; they are Kateb wants to articulate a defensible &quot;attachment to existence&quot; without relying on &quot;any kind of totality.&quot; </span>Existence cannot be justified by any &quot;internal&quot; or human standarddeveloped independently of a supposed divine authentication<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That is to say, </span>attachment cannot be cultivated by way of a theology<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> . . . or by way of a believable reconciliation to the facts of wickedness, suffering, waste, cruelty, obscenity, and death. The universe . . . is without sponsorship; and existence on earth fails every test that is strenuously pressed. . . . What is needed is precisely a mode that is content not to make the world —human and natural existence on earth —into a story, a picture, an order or a pattern . . . that is, into a self-adequate totality or into a necessary part of a transcendent totality.8 The puzzle we retain, after Nietzsche, is to find a way to establish hu- man value without the aid of an external totality (whether religious, scientific, or merely commonsensical).9 </span>Kateb's strategy is to shift attention to the institutional and philosophical contexts within which this discussion of survival proceeds. Such a broadening of the question could confront the excessive individualism that otherwise makes &quot;survival&quot; a suspect theme<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If the extreme individualism of this century cannot be absorbed into metaphysics, Kateb claims, it is still the case that individualism and the institutions of democracy are not easily dismissed: &quot;Individualism in some of its developments after the seventeenth century contains . . . saving thoughts and feelings. The great work of Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman comprises the main development, and the phrase 'democratic individuality' perhaps best names their idealism.&quot;10</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To broaden these saving possibilities within individualism, Kateb (in a surprising move, for him) suggests that we take heart from the &quot;antidemocratic individualist doctrines of Nietzsche and Heidegger,&quot; both writers who influence contemporary language approaches. &quot;The best defensive idealism is individualism,&quot; but &quot;the self-surpassing of both rightsbased individualism and existentialist individualism is the unique source of a selfless and saving attachment.&quot;1! In short, without adopting the categories I am attaching to this position, Kateb poses the possibility of a historical, yet ambivalent and even </span>poststructuralist, individualism —a political form of nuclear criticism —as a response to the broad crisis of meaning in the late modern era.<br />

 <strong>Mutually exclusive – aff attempts at certainty and a localized response to nuclearism while still sustaining the system dooms the alt</strong><br />
<strong>Chaloupka 1992</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">–</span> <span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Professor and Chair of the department of political science at Colorado State University (William, “Knowing Nukes: the politics and culture of the atom,” University of Minnesota Press, 1992. p 103-104 CMR) </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><strong>”Lifestyle proponents” are people who try to change their lifestyle and passively subvert the system on an individual level – “yuppies”</strong></span><br />
<br />
The point for the lifestyle proponents may be to present their position as enduring irony, unlikely to be domesticated, resolutely irresolute<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The model here is the artist:back and forth, eddying from criticism to expression before starting again, differently this time<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.54 </span>No certainty is available; the language-and-politics position has accurately observed the end of that possibility.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But </span>the possibility for interventions against power is hardly made unfeasible by this lack of certainty<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Foucault concluded his brief discussion of ecology politics with a calibration of just such an opening: </span>We could criticize politics<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> —beginning for example with the effects of the state of domination . . . —but we could only do this </span>by playing a certain game of truth, showing what were the effects, showing that there were other rational possibilities, teaching people what they ignore about their own situation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on their conditions of work, on their exploitation.55 The progressive hope can be discarded — must be, indeed —but the notion that politics itself vanishes at the same point is a vain critique, one that conflates Utopia or hope with the struggles against power. It is already clear, I have argued, that </span>the struggles continue quite well under the flag of (unflagging) irony<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The demarcations between such an ironic position and a more sincere one will always be a matter of interpretation and negotiation. If one starts with the assumption that politics must be oriented from some external, confident position, anyone who denied that assumption is then open to the charge that he or she has engaged in purely personal indulgences and extravagances, with no link to institutional change. It is a subtext of my argument to demonstrate how far this assumption is from being a necessity. Once more: </span>the abandonment of any metaphysical solidarity in no way requires the adoption of private, solipsistic signaling into the void as a model for politics<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But </span>the dispute resolutely remains lodged <em>in between</em> truth-producing discourses<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Any case for (or even against) the ironical, interventionist position will always be speculative and rhetorical. </span>It is, at a minimum, important to</strong> dislodge the presumption that the lifestyle position represents the only (or even necessarily the first) response possible in the face of nuclearism**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, before I move, in the next chapter, to expand discussion of alternatives.</span><br />

 <strong><u>The final market</u>—plan seeks to expand capitalism through search for surplus</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Parker, 9. Martin (University of Leicester School of Management), The Sociological Review Volume 57</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This chapter explores a paradox.1 </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I want to believe that the ends of space explorationrest on a certain orientation to the future, a possibility that what comes next might be substantially different</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from what happens at the present time. This, I believe, is a sort of utopian projection that lies at the heart of any radical politics. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">At the same time</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the means for space exploration</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> currently appear to </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">require that</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> certain rather </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">everyday desires are projectedoutwardsto a staras if it were a new market segment</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. So we imagine 42 light years, and see PepsiCo in space. But I do not think that this is merely reducible to a matter of means or ends, as if the two never met. At the beginning of the 20th century Max</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Weber made a nice distinction between technical rationality (zweckrational) and value rationality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (wertrational). </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The former refers to the sort of efficiency and organization that it is rational to adopt once you have decided on a particular course of action</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and he claims that this is </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">epitomised by the bureaucratic organizational form</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Bureaucracy connects means to means, without hatred or passion, in order that ramified chains of cause and effect can be built that would otherwise stumble and evaporate. Without bureaucratic reason, we would not be able to administer a state, or manufacture a corn chip, or a Saturn V rocket. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But states</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, corn chips and Saturn V rockets </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">are insufficient to explain themselves, so Weber suggests that values must be the ultimate ends of action.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Values, desires, are not ‘rational’ in themselves, but provide a target for technique. But, he says, there is a sense in which his age was becoming an age in which means were becoming ends in themselves, and notions of ‘calling’, of value, were fading away.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">‘Where the fulfilment of the calling cannot be directly related to the highest spiritual and cultural values, or when, on the other hand, it need not be felt simply as economic compulsion, the individual generally abandons the attempt to justify it at all. In the field of its highest development, in the United States, the pursuit of wealth, stripped of its religious and ethical meaning, tends to become associated with purely mundane passions, which often actually give it the character of sport.’ (Weber, 1930: 182)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">So the means become the end. The end is the playing of the game, and finds no justification beyond itself, and questions about ends, about values, are no longer asked</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> it seems to me, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is the paradox of</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> having </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">capitalists in space.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As if the distance between the Earth and 47 Ursae Majoris is a problem for marketing, and </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the sublime evaporates in the exhaust fumes of managerialism.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But, at the same time, it is naïve to imagine that Apollo and the rest have been free from such earthly entanglements. In the context, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">it doesn't matter that much whether we articulate these entanglements as nation building; party political interest; hidden subsidy of the military industrial complex, or research institutes; career and identity projects;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> needing to pay the mortgage; or compensating for small penis size. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">All these, and many more, have undoubtedly driven human beings to work on space exploration projects. But now, in an era of globalising capitalism, it seems that matters of profit and loss are becoming more relevant than ever in driving human beings to such work</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Commercial space tourist flights will be the first clear example of what has, so far, been a tendency partly concealed by state and state agency operations. But now, it seems, NASA is being pushed out of the way, in order that enterprise can be launched.</span><br />

Because the capitalists own the means of production, they are able to keep the surplus wealth created by workers above and beyond the cost of paying worker's wages and other costs of production. </span><span class="Underline">This surplus is called &quot;profit&quot; and consists of unpaid labor that the capitalists appropriate and use to achieve ever-greater profits. These profits are turned into capital which capitalists use to further exploit the producers of all wealth-the working class. </span> Capitalists<span class="Underline"> are compelled by competition to seek to maximize profits. The capitalist </span>class<span class="Underline"> as a whole can do that only by </span>extracting a greater surplus from the unpaid labor of workers<span class="Underline"> by </span>increasing exploitation<span class="Underline">. Under capitalism, economic development happens only if it is profitable to the individual capitalists, not for any social need or good. The </span>profit drive<span class="Underline"> is inherent in capitalism, and </span>underlies<span class="Underline"> or exacerbates </span>all<span class="Underline"> major </span>social ills of our time<span style="font-size: 7pt;">s.

Many workers are forced to work second and third jobs to make ends meet. Most workers now average four different occupations during their lifetime, being involuntarily moved from job to job and career to career. Often, retirement-age workers are forced to continue working just to provide health care for themselves. </span><span class="Underline">With capitalist globalization, jobs move as capitalists export factories and even entire industries to other countries. Millions of people continuously live below the poverty level; many suffer homelessness and hunger.

Racism permeates the police, judicial and prison systems, perpetuating unequal sentencing, racial profiling, discriminatory enforcement, and police brutality. </span><span class="Underline">The democratic, civil and human rights of all working people are continually under attack.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> These attacks range from increasingly difficult procedures for union recognition and attempts to prevent full union participation in elections, to the absence of the right to strike for many public workers. They range from undercounting minority communities in the census to making it difficult for working people to run for office because of the domination of corporate campaign funding and the high cost of advertising. These attacks also include growing censorship and domination of the media by the ultra-right; growing restrictions and surveillance of activist social movements and the Left; open denial of basic rights to immigrants; and, violations of the Geneva Conventions up to and including torture for prisoners. </span><span class="Underline">These abuses all serve to maintain the grip of the </span>capitalists<span class="Underline"> on government power.

<strong>Hollowing out capitalism solves – also avoids transition wars</strong><br />
<strong>Herod 2004</strong>—James, Faculty at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/index.htm</a><br />
It is time to try to describe, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">at first abstractly and later concretely,</span> a strategy for destroying capitalism. This strategy, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">at its most basic</span>, calls for pulling time, energy, and resources out of capitalist civilization and putting them into building a new civilization. The image then is one of emptying out capitalist structures, hollowing them out, by draining wealth, power, and meaning out of them until there is nothing left but shells. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is definitely an aggressive strategy. It requires great militancy, and constitutes an attack on the existing order. The strategy clearly recognizes that capitalism is the enemy and must be destroyed, but</span> it is not a frontal attack aimed at overthrowing the system, but an inside attack aimed at gutting it, while simultaneously replacing it with something better, something we want. Thus capitalist structures<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (corporations, governments, banks, schools, etc.) </span>are<span style="font-size: 8pt;">not <em>seized</em> so much as simply </span><em>abandoned</em>. Capitalist relations are not <em>fought</em> so much as they are simply <em>rejected</em>. We <em>stop participating</em> in activities that support<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (finance, condone) </span>the capitalist world and <em>start participating</em> in activities that build a new world while simultaneously undermining the old<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We create a new pattern of social relations alongside capitalist relations and then we continually build and strengthen our new pattern while doing every thing we can to weaken capitalist relations</span>. In this way our new democratic, non-hierarchical, non-commodified relations can eventually overwhelm the capitalist relations and force them out of existence. This is how it has to be done. This is a plausible, realistic strategy. To think that we could create a whole new world of decent social arrangements overnight, in the midst of a crisis, during a so-called revolution, or during the collapse of capitalism, is foolhardy. Our new social world must grow within the old, and in opposition to it, until it is strong enough to dismantle and abolish capitalist relations.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Such a revolution will never happen automatically, blindly, determinably, because of the inexorable, materialist laws of history. It will happen, and only happen, because we want it to, and because we know what we’re doing and know how we want to live, and know what obstacles have to be overcome before we can live that way, and know how to distinguish between our social patterns and theirs. </span>But we must not think that the capitalist world can simply be ignored, in a live and let live attitude, while we try to build new lives elsewhere.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(There <em>is</em> no elsewhere.) There is at least one thing, wage-slavery, that we can’t simply stop participating in (but even here there are ways we can chip away at it). Capitalism must be <em>explicitly refused</em> and replaced by something else. </span>This constitutes <em>War</em>, but it is not a war in the traditional sense of armies and tanks, but a war fought on a daily basis, on the level of everyday life, by millions of people. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is a war nevertheless because the accumulators of capital will use coercion, brutality, and murder, as they have always done in the past, to try to block any rejection of the system</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">They have always had to force compliance; they will not hesitate to continue doing so. Nevertheless, there are many concrete ways that individuals, groups, and neighborhoods can gut capitalism, which I will enumerate shortly. We must always keep in mind how we became slaves; then we can see more clearly how </span>we can cease being slaves<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We were forced into wage-slavery because the ruling class slowly, systematically, and brutally destroyed our ability to live autonomously</span>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">By driving us off the land, changing the property laws, destroying community rights, destroying our tools, imposing taxes, destroying our local markets, and so forth, we were forced onto the labor market in order to survive, our only remaining option being to sell, for a wage, our ability to work. It’s quite clear then how we can overthrow slavery. We must reverse this process. We must begin to reacquire the ability to live without working for a wage or buying the products made by wage-slaves (that is, we must get free from the labor market and the way of living based on it), and embed ourselves instead in cooperative labor and cooperatively produced goods. Another clarification is needed. </span>This strategy does not call for <em>reforming</em> capitalism, for changing capitalism into something else. It calls for <em>replacing</em> capitalism, totally, with a new civilization.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This is an important distinction, because</span> capitalism has proved impervious to reforms, as a system. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">We can sometimes in some places win certain concessions from it (usually only temporary ones) and win some (usually short-lived) improvements in our lives as its victims, but </span>we cannot reform it piecemeal, as a system. Thus our strategy of gutting and eventually destroying capitalism requires at a minimum a totalizing image, an awareness that we are attacking an entire way of life and replacing it with another, and not merely reforming one way of life into something else. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Many people may not be accustomed to thinking about entire systems and social orders, but everyone knows what a lifestyle is, or a way of life, and that is the way we should approach it. The thing is this: in order for capitalism to be destroyed millions and millions of people must be dissatisfied with their way of life. They must <em>want something else</em> and see certain existing things as obstacles to getting what they want. It is not useful to think of this as a new ideology. It is not merely a belief-system that is needed, like a religion, or like Marxism, or Anarchism. Rather it is a new prevailing vision, a dominant desire, an overriding need. What must exist is a pressing desire to live a certain way, and not to live another way. </span>If this pressing desire were a desire to live free, to be autonomous, to live in democratically controlled communities, to participate in the self-regulating activities of a mature people, then capitalism could be destroyed. Otherwise we are doomed to perpetual slavery and possibly even to extinction.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The content of this vision is actually not new at all, but quite old. The long term goal of communists, anarchists, and socialists has always been to restore community. Even the great peasant revolts of early capitalism sought to get free from external authorities and restore autonomy to villages. Marx defined communism once as a free association of producers, and at another time as a situation in which the free development of each is a condition for the free development of all. Anarchists have always called for worker and peasant self-managed cooperatives. </span>The long term goals have always been clear: to abolish wage-slavery, to eradicate a social order organized solely around the accumulation of capital for its own sake, and to establish in its place a society of free people who democratically and cooperatively self-determine the shape of their social world.<br />

 <strong>Exploration requires staffed missions</strong><br />
<strong>Logsdon, 9</strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">– </span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">professor of political science at George Washington, former director of the Space Policy Institute (John, “Fifty Years of Human Spaceflight </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Why Is There Still a Controversy?,” </span></em> <span style="font-size: 8pt;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4104:http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4104 -->)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Exploration as a Compelling Rationale</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Many believe that the only sustainable rationale for a government-funded program of human spaceflight is to take the lead in exploring the solar system beyond low Earth orbit.20 </span><u>The MIT white paper</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> provides an insightful definition of exploration:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Exploration is a human activity, undertaken by certain cultures at certain times for particular reasons. It has components of national interest, scientific research, and technical innovation, but is defined by none of them. </span><u>We</u><u>define exploration as an expansion of the realm of human experience, bringing people into new places, situations, and environments</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, expanding and redefining what it means to be human. What is the role of Earth in human life? Is human life fundamentally tied to the earth, or could it survive without the planet?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Human presence, and its attendant risk, turns a spaceflight into a story that is compelling to large numbers of people. Exploration also has a moral dimension because it is in effect a cultural conversation on the nature and meaning of human life. </span><u>Exploration</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by this definition </span><u>can only be accomplished by direct human presence</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and may be deemed worthy of the risk of human life.21</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the wake of the 2003 </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Columbia </span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">accident that took the lives of seven astronauts and the report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board that criticized the absence of a compelling mission for human spaceflight as “a failure of national leadership,”22 </span><u>the U</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates, in January 2004, </span><u>adopted a new policy</u><u>to guide its human spaceflight activities</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The policy directed NASA to “implement a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system and beyond” and to “extend human presence across the solar system, starting with a human return to the Moon by the year 2020, in preparation for human exploration of Mars and other destinations.”23 </span><u>This policy seems totally consistent with the definition of exploration provided in the MIT white paper</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The issue is whether such a policy and its implementation, focusing on human exploration beyond Earth orbit, can provide an adequate and sustainable justification for a continuing program of government-sponsored spaceflight that will make contributions that will outweigh the costs and risks involved to the “primary objectives” of national pride and prestige, and also to some of the several “secondary objectives.”</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">When </span>space development enthusiasts describe how permanent human communities might be established in space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, they often draw analogies to the European colonization of the Americas and to the “winning” of the western frontiers of the United States and Canada, analogies which are often given a very contemporary libertarian spin. Complex historical processes are offered up as examples of the triumph of individualism and private enterprise. The unspun truth about the “winning” of the western frontiers of the United States and Canada make for even poorer libertarian dramas. Notwithstanding all the hardy pioneers in their covered wagons, the western frontier of the United States was really “won” by the U.S. Army and the construction of the railroads which were capitalized by enormous Federal land grants.[5] Similarly, the western frontier of Canada was “won” by cash grants, subsidies, loans, and the guarantee of bond issues by the Canadian government to finance the construction of the railroads. A better historical analogy for establishing permanent human communities in space is actually provided by one of the greatest civil engineering project of this century--the construction of the Panama Canal. As would be true with any very large space development project, constructing the Panama Canal required that tough new engineering and science problems had to be overcome in an unforgiving environment, a labor force had to be imported and supported, and sufficient capital had to be invested despite the fact that private investors could not or would not provide the financing necessary to complete the task. After twenty years of failed efforts by private French firms to dig a canal across the isthmus of Panama and the failure of a private American firm to dig a canal through Nicaragua, it was the United States government that successfully completed the construction of the Panama Canal.[6] Financing by the United States government and management by U.S. Army engineers succeeded where the private sector failed. Engineering problems more difficult than those which were encountered in constructing the Suez Canal were solved, yellow fever and malaria were effectively controlled, a new sovereign nation-state was created, and world commerce was facilitated.[7] Not bad for government work. Very large </span>space development projects should be understood as massive public works projects constructed to provide the environmental and economic requirements for permanent human settlement beyond Earth<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If these new human settlements are to attract and keep the kind of people needed, then they will have to be livable communities. Making them livable will provide plenty of scope for private firms to profit from the provision of goods and services. But private firms will not do the heavy lifting necessary to finance the construction of the very large space project within which and around which such a livable community may grow.</span><br />

<strong>Limits outweigh and turn every other standard – key to participation</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Rowland, 84</strong><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">(Robert C., Baylor U., “Topic Selection in Debate”, American Forensics in Perspective. Ed. Parson, p. 53-4)</span></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The first major problem identified by the work group as relating to topic selection is the decline in participation in the National Debate Tournament (NDT) policy debate. As Boman notes: There is a growing dissatisfaction with academic debate that utilizes a policy proposition. Programs which are oriented toward debating the national policy debate proposition, so-called “NDT” programs, are diminishing both in scope and size. This decline in policy debate is tied, many in the work group believe, to excessively broad topics. The most obvious characteristic of some recent policy debate topics is extreme breadth. A resolution calling for regulation of land use literally and figuratively covers a lot of ground. National debate topics have not always been so broad. Before the late 1960s the topic often specified a particular policy change. The move from narrow to broad topics has had, according to some, the effect of limiting the number of students who participate in policy debate. First, the breadth of topics has all but destroyed novice debate. Paul Gaske argues that because the stock issues of policy debate are clearly defined, it is superior to value debate as a means of introducing students to the debate process. Despite this advantage of policy debate, Gaske believes that NDT debate is not the best vehicle for teaching beginners. The problem is that broad topicsterrify novice debaters, especially those who lack high school debate experience. They are unable to cope with the breath of the topic and experience “negophobia,” the fear of debating negative. As a consequence, the educational advantages associated with teaching novice through policy debate are lost: “Yet all of these benefits fly out the window as rookies in their formative stage quickly experience humiliation at being caught without evidence or substantive awareness of the issues that confront them at a tournament.” The ultimate result is that fewernovices participate in NDT, thus lessening the educational value of the activity and limiting thenumber of debaters who eventually participate in more advanced divisions of policy debate. In addition to noting the effect on novices, participants argued that broad topics also discourage experienced debaters from continuedparticipation in policy debate. Here, the claim is that it takes so much time and effort to be competitive on a broad topic that students who are concerned with doing more than just debate are forced out of the activity. Gaske notes, that “broad topics discourage participation because of insufficient time to do requisite research.” The final effect may be that entire programs wither cease functioning or shift to value debate as a way to avoid unreasonable research burdens. Boman supports this point: “It is this expanding necessity of evidence, and thereby research, which has created a competitive imbalance between institutions that participate in academic debate.” In this view, it is the competitive imbalance resulting from the use of broad topics that has led some small schools to cancel their programs.</span><br />

<br />
A recent study reports that high school students who study fewer<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> science </span>topics, but study them in greater depth, have an advantage in collegescience classes over their peers who study more topics and spend less time on each. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Robert </span>Tai, associate professor at the University of Virginia<span style="font-size: 8pt;">'s Curry </span>School of Education, worked with<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Marc S. </span>Schwartz of the University of Texas<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at Arlington and Philip M.

The study will appear in the July 2009 print edition of Science Education and is currently available as an online pre-print from the journal. &quot;As a former high school teacher, I always worried about whether it was better to teach less in greater depth or more with no real depth. </span>This study offers evidence that teaching fewer topics in greater depth is a better way to prepare students for success in college<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> science,&quot; Tai said. &quot;These </span>results are based on the performance of thousands of college<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> science </span>students from across the United States<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; The 8,310 students in the study were enrolled in introductory biology, chemistry or physics in randomly selected four-year colleges and universities. </span>Those who spent one month or more studying one major topic in-depth in high school earned higher grades in college<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> science </span>than their peers who studied more topics in the same period of time. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The study revealed that </span>students in courses that focused on mastering a particular topic were impacted twice as much as those in courses that touched on every major topic.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As is well understood, the space policies of the Bush administration were decidedly oriented toward military security concerns and independent action. The 2006 National Space Policy unabashedly proclaimed the U.S. intention to maintain a dominant position in space indefinitely. This policy orientation dismissed multilateral cooperation as impinging on U.S. “freedom of action,” throwing weight instead behind a wide range of technology development initiatives founded on the assumption that deployment of weapons in space was, if not already factual, certainly inevitable.2 U.S. commercial and civil engagement was overshadowed by these security concerns, expressed through the tightening of export control restrictions inhibiting a broad range of technology sharing. Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This background is essential for appreciating how </span>the space policies of the Obama administrationare beginning to genuinely break new trails<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. </span>Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Less broadly noticed was this policy’s clarity and coherence in articulating a vision for U.S. space activities on its own terms. The document is organized around core principles, subsidiary goals and implementing guidelines that exceed its predecessors in delineating a longer-term direction for U.S. space policy that is integrated with, rather than derivative of, broader U.S. global aims.4 The policy also was generated and issued far earlier in the tenure of the administration than either of its predecessors, indicating an increased prioritization of attention to space policy at higher levels of policy-making.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To some degree,</span> a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, </span>new budget realitiesandunpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds.</span><br />
The 2011 National Security Space Strategy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, released February 4, </span>is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and greater attention to space policy in general. This first-of-its-kind strategic statement culminates a congressionally mandated space posture review.6 The initial section portraying the strategic environment to which U.S. security policy must be responsive highlights the growing problems of space debris, orbital congestion and coordination among a growing number of space actors — not state-based security threats per se. The Security Space Strategy features the objective of a “stable space environment in which nations exercise shared responsibility.”7 Specific provisions intended to implement this strategy, relevant to the preceding observations, include:8 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">• The strategy presents a full section on “Partnering with Responsible Nations, International Organizations, and Commercial Firms.” This category is not wholly multilateral in the traditional sense, displaying a symbiosis of alliance-building and collective cooperation not always carefully distinguished; i.e., “The United States will lead in building coalitions of like-minded space-faring nations and, where appropriate, work with international institutions to do so.”</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">• The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, </span>the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and <em>norms of behavior for responsible space operations</em>.”<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. </span>This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), </span>whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the longer-term.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">• </span>The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” and to “expand provision of safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">• </span>The strategy commits to reforming export controls.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “In particular, as new opportunities arise for international collaboration, a revised export control system will better enable the domestic firms competing for these contracts.” As noted above, the oppressive impact of current U.S. export controls not only impinges on U.S. commercial space actors but also epitomizes the high degree to which U.S. policy has subsumed commercial and civil interests to national security concerns. The strategy appears to acknowledge this connection and commit to remedy it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">• The most assertive passages of the statement are moderated with community-building intent. For example, the strategy’s section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression” concludes that the U.S. “will retain the right and capabilities to respond in self-defense, should deterrence fail,” but immediately adds that the U.S. “will use force in a manner that is consistent with longstanding principles of international law, treaties to which the United States is a party, and the inherent right of self defense.”</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">• The concluding and most conflict-oriented section of the strategy opens by noting that “some actors may still believe counterspace actions could provide military advantage.” Counterspace capabilities, unarticulated in the document, include ASATs, ground-based directed energy weapons and satellite transmission jamming. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Gregory Schulte explained at the strategy’s rollout that China is a principal concern in this regard, but so is the proliferation of these technologies: “If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry what others can do.”10 This section of the strategy does not, however, call for maintaining options to develop complementary space conflict capabilities.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Rather, the strategy asserts that the U.S. “must be prepared to ‘fight through’ a degraded environment,” and identifies “resilience” and “space protection” as the key criteria.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps </span>as striking<span style="font-size: 8pt;">as the prevalence of such passages, however, </span>is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the kind of </span>independent space-based military capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 </span><br />
The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative “as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. </span><br />
These policy movements toward multilateral engagementand commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 Critics also decried the strategy’s emphasis on “the old fallacious assumption that the power of example will prevent adversaries from doing the United States harm,” and endorsed maintaining the goal of U.S. retention of a “dominant position in military and intelligence space capabilities.”15 In fact, the administration’s warming toward normative commitments in general — and the EU Code of Conduct in particular — are in part intended to forestall pressure for more formal and binding measures that would definitively cut off the “hedge” of unilateral U.S. weapons development options.16 The balance of U.S. debate may have shifted toward greater international cooperation, but the terms of the debate remain the same.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In sum, </span>the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and more importantly, </span>a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details. </span><br />

A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of 'peace through strength' deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that '… the presence of space weapons…will result in<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the increased likelihood of </span>their use'<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.33 This drift toward usage is strengthened by a strategic fact elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, 'anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand'.34 </span>The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent 'dual capability' of spaceborne weapon components<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Marc Vidricaire, Delegation of Canada to the UN Conference on Disarmament, explains: 'If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land'. 35 To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such</span> interceptors can<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span>be used as orbiting 'Death Stars', capable of sending munitions hurtling through the Earth's atmosphere. The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense 'use or lose' pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig <span style="font-size: 8pt;">orbiting</span> Death Stars with automated 'hair trigger' devices<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, </span>by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed 'complexly interactive, tightly coupled' industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other's flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains, '[t]he odd term &quot;normal accident&quot; is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable'.36 </span>Deployment of space weaponswith pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to 'normal accidents'. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, </span>'even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage — even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!'<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 37 In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: 'One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people'.38 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that </span>any nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To prevent adversaries from shooting back, the </span>United Stateswould need to know exactly where all threatening space objects are located<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, to neutralize them without producing debris that can damage US or allied space objects, and </span>to target and defeat all ground-based military activities<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that could join the fight in space. In other words, successful </span>space warfare mandates pre-emptive strikes and a preventive war in space as well as on the ground<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>War plans and execution often go awry here on Earth<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It </span>takes enormous hubris to believe that space warfarewould be any different<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>If ASAT a<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nd space-based, ground-attack weapons </span>are flight-tested and deployed,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> space warriors will have succeeded in the dubious achievement of replicating the hair-trigger nuclear postures that plagued humankind during the Cold War. </span>Armageddon nuclear postures continue to this day, with thousands of US and Russian nuclear weapons ready to be launched in minutes to incinerate opposing forces<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, command and control nodes, and other targets, some of which happen to be located within large metropolitan areas. </span>If the heavens were weaponized, these nuclear postures would be reinforced and elevated into space.<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">US </span>space warriors<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> now have a doctrine and plans for counterspace operations, but they </span>do not have a credible plan to stop<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> inadvertent or uncontrolled </span>escalation once the shooting starts<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Like US war-fighting scenarios, there is a huge chasm between plans and consequences, in which requirements for escalation dominance make uncontrolled escalation far more likely. </span>A pre-emptive strike in space on a nation that possesses nuclear weapons would invite the gravest possible consequences<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Attacks on satellites that provide early warning and other critical military support functions </span>would<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> most </span>likely be viewed either as a surrogate or as a prelude to attacks on nuclear forces.<br />

A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that <em>might</em> have been persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization.<span style="color: black;">[4]</span> Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There is also a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that </span>a smaller nuclear exchange<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, between India and Pakistan for instance, </span>is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Such a war might however be a local terminal risk for the cities most likely to be targeted. Unfortunately, we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vote neg on presumption – china takes out are satellites the second we build them if they’re truly evil </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Blazejewski 8 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Kenneth, received his master’s degree in public affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University and his JD degree from the New York University School of Law, &quot; Space Weaponization and US-China Relations.&quot; Spring, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4114:http://www.au.af.mil/au/ssq/2008/Spring/blazejewski.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/ssq/2008/Spring/blazejewski.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.au.af.mil/au/ssq/2008/Spring/blazejewski.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4114 -->, AD 6/29/11)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">I recommend that the United States accept a commitment to forgo placement of weapons in outer space. The costs of space weaponization simply outweigh the benefits. Above, I argue that </span>China would respond to US space weaponization with some level of military buildup.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In the least, this </span>response would include the deployment of a more robust ASAT system capable of attacking and potentially eliminating space weapons.52<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> After all, </span>space weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, like military satellites, </span>make for vulnerable military targets<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.53 The </span><strong>use of space-based weapons in a conflict must be discounted by the likelihood</strong> <strong>that they would be eliminated by Chinese ASAT attack</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. More importantly, </span>increased ASAT deploymentwould<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have the counterproductive effect of </span>exposing US satellites to greater threat<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Aside from ASAT issues, Chinese response to US space weaponization would include an increase in China’s ICBM fleet and nuclear arsenal. Vertical proliferation cannot be in the interests of the United States, if only for the increased peacetime risks of accidental launch or the terrorist risk associated with increased availability of weapons technology and components. Finally, the United States should not discount the possibility, often cited by opponents of space weaponization, that the deployment of US space weapons would instigate a space arms race.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Most probable – space weapons multiplies the risks of miscalc and tech accidents – also guarantees great power escalation</strong><br />
<strong>Hitchens 2008 --</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">directs the Center for Defense Information in Washington, D.C., and leads its Space Security Project, in cooperation with the Secure World Foundation (Theresa, “SPACE WARS..” </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Scientific American</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; Mar2008, Vol. 298 Issue 3, p78-85, 8p, EBSCO) CMR </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Perhaps of even greater concern is that several other nations, including one of China's regional rivals, </span>India<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>may feel compelled to seek offensive as well as defensive capabilities in space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The U.S. trade journal Defense News, for instance, quoted unidentified Indian defense officials as stating that their country had already begun developing its own kinetic-energy (nonexplosive, hit-to-kill) and laser-based antisatellite weapons.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">If </span>India goes down that path, its archrival Pakistan will probably follow suit<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Like India, Pakistan has a well-developed ballistic missile program, including medium-range missiles that could launch an antisatellite system. Even </span>Japan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the third major Asian power, </span>might join such a space race<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In June 2007 the National Diet of Japan began considering a bill backed by the current Fukuda government that would permit the development of satellites for &quot;military and national security&quot; purposes.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As for Russia, in the wake of the Chinese test President Vladimir Putin reiterated Moscow's stance against the weaponization of space. At the same time, though, he refused to criticize Beijing's actions and blamed the U.S. instead.The American efforts to build a missile defense system, Putin charged, and the increasingly aggressive </span>American plans for a military position in space were prompting China's moves<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Yet </span>Russia<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> itself, as a major spacefaring power that has incorporated satellites into its national security structure, </span>would be hard-pressed to forgo entering an arms race in space.<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Given the proliferation of spacefaring entities [see box at left], </span>proponents of a robust space warfare strategy believe that arming the heavens is inevitable and that it would be best for the U.S. to get there first with firepower<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Antisatellite and space-based weapons, they argue, will be necessary not only to defend U.S. military and commercial satellites but also to deny any future adversary the use of space capabilities to enhance the performance of its forces on the battlefield.</span><br />
Yet any arms race in space would almost inevitably destabilize the balance of power and thereby <strong>multiply the risks of global conflict</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>In such headlong competition<span style="font-size: 8pt;">--whether in space or elsewhere--</span>equilibrium among the adversaries would be virtually impossible to maintain<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even if the major powers did achieve stability, that reality would still </span>provide no guarantee that both sides would perceive it to be so.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The </span>moment one side saw itself to be slipping behind the other, the first side would be strongly tempted to launch a preemptive strike<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>before things got even worse<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ironically, the same would hold for the side that perceived itself to have gained an advantage. Again, there would be </span>strong temptation to strike first<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, before the adversary could catch up. Finally, a </span><strong>space weapons race would ratchet up the chances that a mere technological mistake could trigger a battle</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. After all, in the distant void, reliably distinguishing an intentional act from an accidental one would be highly problematic.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;">Glaser: Since it would be such a huge undertaking, I think </span><u><span style="color: #0d0d0d;">it would be best accomplished at an international level</span></u><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;">, perhaps even </span><u><span style="color: #0d0d0d;">managed by the U</span></u><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u><span style="color: #0d0d0d;">N</span></u><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;">ations. Each country could contribute their best effort, and then each country would reap the benefit of cheap and plentiful power from the sun.

<span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 8pt;">On the other hand, </span><u><span style="color: #0d0d0d;">if one nation decides to build the system, all hell may break loose.

<strong>Their aerospace advantage is the link</strong><br />
<strong>Lewis, 11</strong> - Senior Fellow and Director Technology and Public Policy Program Center for Strategic and International Studies (James, High Frontier, “Engagement and Sustainability in the 2010 National Space Policy,” February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-110224-052.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-110224-052.pdf</a><br />
<br />
<u>Administrations write national space policies for a public and international audience. This foreign audience’s general view of the issuing administration shapes their interpretation of the policy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The message taken from the previous administration’s space policy, particularly by international audiences, was a unilateral assertion of dominance</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">These foreign perceptions of the 2006 NSP may have been exaggerated by a belief that it was cut from the same cloth as other US military policies, such as the invasion of Iraq and the international actions against terrorism, but foreign perceptions were not essentially wrong. The essential theme of 2006 reflected the forceful unilateralism that underlay foreign and security policy. The 2006 policy asserted US control and the right to deny the use of space to its opponents while rejecting any agreements that might limit US freedom of action—military action—in space.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It could be argued that this theme of US leadership in space (which could appear to foreign audiences as an assertion of dominance) is found in earlier space policies, and the 2006 policy changed only the tone and the weighting of policy by adding emphasis to this aspect. However, in the context of foreign perceptions of American foreign policy, this increased emphasis on dominance and denial was counterproductive in two ways.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">First, </span><u>announcing that the US has the right to untrammeled action in space, including the use of force, to preserve its interests, creates “antibodies,” as other nations look for ways to constrain the US</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>It also legitimizes their own military space programs and shapes other nations interagency debates on space policy and space weapons in ways unfavorable to the US.</u><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">From a technical perspective, it may be possible to deny the use of space by opponents, but it would be very difficult and perhaps impossible to prevent them from degrading US freedom of action in space through attacks on the American satellite fleet. Satellites are soft targets. America has many of them. </span><u>An astute opponent could conclude that the US would have more to lose and come out worse in any exchange once counterspace action commenced.</u><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Second, </span><u>by renouncing any form of arms control for space, the US yielded leadership in international fora to other nations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>It lost the opportunity to find if there were areas where it could “trade” with potential opponents for agreements that could reduce risk to US space assets and interests</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The argument that the Reagan administration had rejected space arms control and there was no need to reconsider that decision flew in the face of a vastly changed space domain, which now includes an array of new opponents who are not bound by the informal understandings on conflict avoidance and on appropriate behavior in space that had grown up between the US and the Soviets.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The idea that there are no agreements, no trades, which could be beneficial to the US, can be rejected out of hand. At a minimum, a US failure to engage internationally leaves the field open for potential opponents to shape opinion and, potentially, rules in ways unfavorable to the US. </span><u>As the nation with the largest fleet of satellites, and being</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, perhaps, </span><u>the most dependent on space, we have an asymmetric vulnerability</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is true that a formal treaty would be unverifiable and difficult to implement, but a treaty is not the only vehicle for international agreement.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">An effort to gain international acceptance of a norm that stigmatizes attacks on unarmed space assets would be in our interest. Finally, some activities—transparency, regard for law— are easier for the US to undertake than for some potential opponents, giving the US a negotiating advantage, should it choose to take it. It is easier for us to be transparent about our space activities, for example, than it is for Russia and China. This is not to say that negotiations would be easy or quick, or that they would not require some skill, but that the US would gain from the process of engagement.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">International cooperation is valuable to a given nation in that it tends to increase political sustainability. Within the United States, a program is made safer from cancellation to the extent that Congress and the administration are not willing to break international agreements. Indeed, the integration of Russia into the ISS program may well have saved the program from cancellation (consider that the year before Russia was introduced as a partner, the ISS was saved by one vote in Congress). Once cooperation has commenced, canceling a program becomes inconsistent with political sustainability as long as the utility cost associated with the loss of diplomatic benefits and the negative effects on reputation of terminating an international agreement is larger in magnitude than the utility cost that must be paid to maintain the system. In the case of the ISS, international cooperation does provide a rationale for sustaining the pro-gram, because canceling the program would result in a net loss in utility. The corollary to this is that there is a high cost to be paid by any nation that chooses to unilaterally withdraw from an existing cooperative endeavor. This cost comes in the form of damage to the departing nation’s reputation or credibility. In general, </span><u>any unilateral action sends a signal that the actor is an unpredictable and therefore an unreliable and possibly disrespectful partner. This tends to sabotage the possibility of future cooperation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As such, </span><u>there is a long-term benefit to maintaining cooperation, even when the immediate cost may seem to call for terminating it</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>If cooperation has never occurred</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (as is the case be-tween China and the United States), </span><u>the advent of cooperation is a significant event</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, likely </span><u>delivering a lot of diplomatic utility.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> On the other hand, </span><u>if cooperation is the norm</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (as is the case between Canada and the United States), </span><u>it is to be expected.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The diplomatic utility of maintaining this cooperation is often not recognized. Nevertheless, </span><u>the diplomatic utility cost of terminating this cooperation is large, because it would alienate a key ally</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If it were necessary to cease cooperation, a mutual choice to do so would likely mitigate many of the negative reputation effects, because there would be no unilateral actor to whom one could assign blame. Indeed, if both parties choose to cease cooperat-ing simultaneously, this would mitigate the negative-reputation effect—rather, there would be a “mutual divorce.” Such a mutual decision would be significantly more tenable, in a diplomatic sense, because each party might outline a set of grievances and conditions for the termination of cooperation. Furthermore, since the agreement would be termi-nated in a spirit of mutual understanding, the possibility of future beneficial cooperation would be more likely. </span><br />

In interviews this week, several rank-and-file House Republicans described themselves as conflicted between wanting to consider the China currency bill and not wishing to pick a fight with leadership on the issue. “I’m torn because I support the issue. ... As far as coming from northeast Indiana, there’s a lot of steel manufacturing; the Chinese manipulation of currency is a problem for us,” said Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-Ind.), one of the 87 members of the House Republican freshman class. Stutzman said that he hadn’t looked into the specifics of the legislation currently making its way through the upper chamber. He called Senate Democrats’ decision to press forward now on the measure “a little odd” considering that the White House has not given its blessing. Still, Stutzman said he’d vote “on a good version” of a China currency bill “whenever it happens.” “As I said, I don’t know what their version is,” he said. “I know we’re focused on a lot of other things. ... But if leadership wants to do it, I’ll be glad to work with them and hopefully support a good version of the bill.” Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) is another lawmaker who said that he would support House consideration of a China currency measure. “I wouldn’t mind having the debate,” said Rooney, who <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/111/house/2/votes/554" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was one of 99 Republicans who joined most Democrats last September</a> in backing a similar measure. “I think that certainly, if there’s an inequity -- having the free-trade argument is one thing, but the people in my district want trade to be fair. ... I would like to see us at some point bring it up.” Also among the House Republicans supporting consideration of a China currency bill is freshman Rep. Allen West (Fla.). “If you don’t take some type of action, you’re going to get even worse behavior, and we’ve got to call the Chinese out on this,” West said this week, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20111006-713089.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>. Several lawmakers in interviews this week declined to take a position on the measure until it has cleared the Senate, which is expected to happen next Tuesday. “I’ll wait ‘til it comes over and see,” said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.), the president of the House Republican freshman class. “Honestly, I’ve been working on a couple of other things. We’ll see what they send over.” The bill has made for some strange political bedfellows: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday echoed conservative senators such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) in calling for the House to take up the China measure. “This is huge, and we must level the playing field,” she said, citing reports that three pending trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia would amount to the creation of only 80,000 jobs while the Chinese currency issue is costing the U.S. more than 1 million jobs. “I can say flat out, with all the respect I have for the people of China, all the importance I place on that relationship ... we are in an abusive relationship with China when it comes to trade.” Pelosi added – as Republican supporters of the measure have noted – that a similar bill last year “passed overwhelmingly in the House.” “I would hope that the Republican majority would give us a chance to bring up the bill,” she said. House Speaker John </span>Boehner<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (R-Ohio) and other House GOP leaders, meanwhile, have </span>struck a skeptical note<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on the measure – just as the White House has done. At an Atlantic Ideas Forum event Thursday morning, </span>he defended<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the actions of the </span>Obama<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and Bush administrations on the Chinese currency issue and argued that the legislation being considered by the Senate would be counterproductive. “Well there’s been concern on my part -- and frankly from a lot of quarters here in America -- about how the Chinese have manipulated their currency,” Boehner said. “There’s been </span>every effort you can imagine out of our Treasury Department<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> over the last seven or eight years addressing this with the Chinese. There’s been significant improvement in the valuation of China’s currency as a result of those conversations. But for the Congress of the United States to pass legislation to force the Chinese to do what is arguably very difficult to do, I think is wrong. It’s dangerous.” </span>Obama<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has said that he shares the goals of the bill’s supporters when it comes to pressuring China to allow the yuan to appreciate. But the </span>White House is unlikely to endorse the Senate legislation. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">That means that </span>for perhaps one of the first times<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the 112th Congress, </span>Obama and Boehner are seeing eye-to-eye<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – and Pelosi and rank-and-file Republicans are united on the other side of the issue.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Many </span>Chinese officials realize<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> this. In fact, “</span>rebalancing” the economy is a<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> prominent </span>goal<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in China’s new five-year economic plan. The currency has been allowed to rise 7 percent against the dollar since June of 2010. Yet in late August the rise slowed to a virtual halt. Analysts fear that China is returning to its old playbook to support its exports amid a faltering global economy. We have no sympathy for the desire of China’s autocrats to stifle political freedoms, but their fear </span>that a swift change in course could lead to social and political upheaval is legitimate<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Even if China’s leaders were persuaded of the need to change<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, it </span>could not happen overnight.

The hour is late. Leading climate scientists such as James Hansen are literally shouting at the top of their lungs that the world needs to reduce emissions<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by 20-40% </span>as soon as possible<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and 80-90% by the year 2050, </span>if we are to avoid climate chaos, crop failures, endless wars, melting of the polar icecaps, and a disastrous rise in ocean levels<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Either we radically reduce CO2<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e, which includes all GHGs, not just CO2) pollutants (currently at 390 parts per million and rising 2 ppm per year) to 350 ppm, including agriculture-derived methane and nitrous oxide pollution, or</span><strong>else survival for the present and future generations is in jeopardy.</strong>As scientists warned at Copenhagen, business as usual and a corresponding 7-8.6 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures means that the <strong>carrying capacity of the Earth</strong> <strong>in 2100 will be reduced to one billion people</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Under this hellish scenario, </span>billions will die of thirst, cold, heat, disease, war, and starvation. If the U.S. significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, other countries will follow<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One hopeful sign is the recent EPA announcement that it intends to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Unfortunately we are going to have to put </span>tremendous pressure on elected public officials to force the EPA to crack down on GHG polluters<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (including industrial farms and food processors). Public pressure is especially critical since &quot;just say no&quot; Congressmen-both Democrats and Republicans-along with agribusiness, real estate developers, the construction industry, and the fossil fuel lobby appear determined to maintain &quot;business as usual.&quot;</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Post-9/11 oil prices have jumped from $15/barrel to now $80/barrel in less than a decade.

This SBSP was first invented in the United States almost 40 years ago. Essentially the central idea of SBSP is very simple (place very large solar arrays into continuously and intensely sunlit Earth orbit (1,366 watts/m2), collect gigawatts of electrical energy, electromagnetically beam it to Earth, and receive it on the surface for use either as baseload power via direct connection to the existing electrical grid, conversion into manufactured synthetic hydrocarbon fuels, or as low-intensity broadcast power beamed directly to consumers).

Amazing isn’t it? This amount of energy from SBSP means that there is a huge potential for reducing global warming for those nations who construct and possess a SBSP capability. But, unfortunately it is not as simple as it looks. Why? This is because it is extremely expensive to get the solar power unit into space (it is anywhere between $500,000 and $1 billion). </span><u>Hopefully, with time these SBSP units will become more economically viable, and thus help in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.</u><br />

Already, strikes and protests are occurring among rank and file workers facing unemployment or non-payment of their salaries. Recent polling demonstrates that the once supreme popularity ratings of Putin and Medvedev are eroding rapidly. Beyond the political elites are the financial oligarchs, who have been forced to deleverage, even unloading their yachts and executive jets in a desperate attempt to raise cash.</span><br />
<u>Should the Russian economy deteriorate</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to the point where economic collapse is not out of the question, </span><u>the impact will go far beyond</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the obvious accelerant such an outcome would be for the Global Economic Crisis. There is a geopolitical dimension that is even more relevant then the economic context. Despite its economic vulnerabilities and perceived decline from superpower status, </span><u>Russia remains one of only two nations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on earth </span><u>with a nuclear arsenal of sufficient scope</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and capability </span><u>to destroy the world as we know it.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For that reason, it is not only President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin who will be lying awake at nights over the prospect that a national economic crisis can transform itself into a virulent and destabilizing social and political upheaval. It just may be possible that U.S. President Barack Obama’s national security team has already briefed him about the consequences of a major economic meltdown in Russia for the peace of the world. After all, the most recent national intelligence estimates put out by the U.S. intelligence community have already concluded that the </span><u>Global Economic Crisis represents the greatest national security threat to the United States, due to its facilitating political instability in the world.</u><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Although &quot;</span><u>necessary</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; is commonly used to denote something &quot;indispensable,&quot; the word </span><u>has long proved</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> more </span><u>elastic in legal parlance</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Nearly a century ago, in <em>State v. Young</em>, 74 Or 399, 406, 145 P 647 (1915), the Oregon Supreme Court observed:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span><u>The word 'necessary' must be construed in the connection in which it is used.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is a </span><u>word susceptible of various meanings</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

The </span><u>courts</u><u>have</u><u>many times construed the word 'necessary</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,' and it has almost universally been held to mean needful or convenient; especially is this the case where the word is used in conjunction with other and stronger terms.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<u>Little has changed</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> since <em>Young</em> </span><u>to</u><u>make the term &quot;necessary</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; so far as it appears in statutes or administrative rules, </span><u>any less ambiguous</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> when read in isolation. As <em>Black's Law Dictionary</em> 1029 (6th ed 1990) explains,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;This word must be considered in the connection in which it is used, as it is a word susceptible of various meanings. It may import absolute physical necessity or inevitability, or it may import that which is only convenient, useful, appropriate, suitable, proper, or conducive to the end sought. It is an adjective expressing degrees, and may express mere convenience or that which is indispensable or an absolute physical necessity. <em>It</em> may mean something which in the accomplishment of a given object cannot be dispensed with, or it may mean something reasonably useful <em>and proper, and of greater or lesser benefit or convenience, and its force and meaning must be determined with relation to the particular object sought</em>.&quot;</span><br />

This was the case in an overview book, written by an author from the US Department of Defense, on the Chinese armed forces. Under the headline ‘‘Nanotechnology Weapons’’ he stated that a Chinese general advertised asymmetric attacks against the USA with ‘‘ant robots’’ which would be pre-deployed covertly. When looking up the original article (interestingly, the English translation was published by the same US author), however, it turns out that it gave a report to a Chinese audience about a study from the US RAND corporation on military micro robots in which </span><u>such systems were mainly discussed for missions by US armed forces</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> against their opponents [6, Section 3.4, 16].

<u>With molecular manufacturing</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, international trade in both raw materials and finished goods can be replaced by decentralized production for local consumption, using locally available materials. The decline of international trade will undermine a powerful source of common interest. Further, artificial intelligence will displace skilled as well as unskilled labor. A world system based on wage labor, transnational capitalism and global markets will necessarily give way. We imagine that a golden age is possible, but we don't know how to organize one. As global capitalism retreats, it will leave behind a world dominated by politics, and possibly feudal concentrations of wealth and power. Economic insecurity, and fears for the material and moral future of humankind may lead to the rise of demagogic and intemperate national leaders. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">With almost </span><u>two hundred sovereign nations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, each struggling to create a new economic and social order, perhaps the most predictable outcome is chaos: </span><u>shifting alignments,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> displaced populations, </span><u>power struggles</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>ethnic conflicts</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> inflamed by demagogues, class conflicts, land disputes, etc. Small and underdeveloped nations will be more than ever dependent on the major powers for access to technology, and more than ever vulnerable to sophisticated forms of control or subversion, or to outright domination. </span><u>Competition</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> among the leading technological powers </span><u>for</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the political </span><u>loyalty of clients</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> might imply reversion to some form of nationalistic imperialism.</span><br />
<br />
<u>Competition for control of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> newly-exploitable </span><u>resources on Earth and in space may generate dissension</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and hostility even between democracies, erstwhile friends and allies, while providing an overt rationale for deploying competitive military forces.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">If nuclear weapons remain limited in number, </span><u>advanced nanotechnology</u><u>could facilitate ext</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ensive civil defense construction, and provide active </span><u>defense</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and </span><u>counterforce weapons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>undermining the nuclear &quot;balance of terror&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and </span><u>creating</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the appearance of a possibility of victory in a </span><strong><u>war between major powers.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">From a purely military perspective, </span><u>in the absence of a &quot;balance of terror</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; a </span><u>confrontation</u><u>between</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> more or less equally advanced terrestrial nanotechnology powers could be </span><u>unstable to preemption</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> — in both of the traditional senses:</span><br />
<br />
<u>Arms race instability</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A large imbalance in deployed hardware could allow one side to strike with impunity, and even a few-to-one imbalance could be enough to provide assurance of victory. If </span><u>military production</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is based on a self-replicating capital base with a short generation time, the </span><u>danger of falling behind</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on an exponential curve, or the opportunity to trump, </span><u>would create</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> unprecedentedly </span><u>strong pressures</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to initiate or join and to maintain or </span><u>gain the lead</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in a quantitative arms race. Unprecedentedly large masses of military hardware could be produced in an unprecedentedly short time.</span><br />
<br />
<u>First strike instability</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even if two sides are evenly matched, high levels of deployed armaments may be militarily unstable, in that a surprise attack could perhaps decimate the opposing force before it could respond. This is </span><u>especially likely in</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> co-occupied environments, i.e. </span><u>space</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the oceans, and along land lines of confrontation. Forces based in protected areas may remain survivable, but serious competitors would not cede vast stretches of &quot;no man's land&quot; to enemy control in advance of a fight, and whoever strikes first in the co-occupied environments may gain an irreversible advantage. The greater the density of interpenetrating forces, the shorter the strike time. Thus a crisis becomes progressively less stable as a buildup proceeds.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A perfect balance of technical and material resources is unrealistic in any case, which leads to a new type of strategic instability:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Early advantage instability. If one has an early lead in a replicator-based crisis arms buildup, the fact that a competitor may have somewhat faster replicators or superior weaponry, or may have access to a larger primary resource base, provides another strong stimulus to an early first strike. Moreover, it is unlikely that one actually knows the performance of an enemy's weapons or production base, particularly after a long peace.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Thus, a </span><u>runaway nanotechnic arms race</u><u>may be a race to nowhere</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; there may be no further island of stable military balance out there, even if we could manage to avoid war along the way.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">• </span><u>Whereas</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> armed </span><u>conflict between USA, Russia and China seems remote at present</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, nevertheless these </span><u>states</u><u>keep</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> their respective forces and train them for such a contingency. At the fundamental level, </span><u>nuclear</u><u>deterrence</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is still at work, too. Thus, </span><u>motives to use new technology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in order </span><u>to prevail</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in such a war – or to prevent that an opponent can prevail – continue to </span><u>exist</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As a consequence, a </span><u>competition in military technology is</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in some way </span><u>going on</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> all the time. </span><u>With</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u>outlook for revolutionary change in many fields, NT could intensify this process</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> drastically – </span><u>accelerating arms races could develop in all areas of military NT applications</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. • One can even argue that to some extent, a similar mechanism is in effect between partners in a military alliance. On the one hand, there is the principal possibility that the political situation in the partner country may change at some time in the future, so that </span><u>armed conflict</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and military threats </span><u>can no longer be excluded</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> completely. 63 On the other hand, arms-race pressures on allies work via the common potential opponent(s). And for the less fast advancing partners there is the argument that for </span><u>co-operation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in armed conflict, </span><u>standardisation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and </span><u>interoperability</u><u>require</u><u>preventing too large a gap to a technologically leading partner</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 64 Thus, it is </span><u>not difficult to conceive of a rush</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> towards, e.g., autonomous </span><u>combat vehicles, should one country start introducing them</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not only between potential opponents, but also among partners – and the same for micro-robots, mini-missiles etc.</span><br />

<u>No</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> reliable </span><u>information on military R&amp;D of NT in Russia was found</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Overview articles on NT work at large make clear that </span><u>there is a</u><u>wide range of civilian activities</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even though hampered by economic difficulties. 54 Russian institutions take part in many international collaborations. In its National Security Concept of 2000, the </span><u>Russian Federation stresses</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its </span><u>concern</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on a general level, with ‘the growing </span><u>technological surge</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of some leading powers and their </span><u>growing possibilities to create new-generation weapons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and military hardware’. Among the principles for use of military force, should that become necessary, it is stated that ‘the restructuring and conversion of the defence industries should not come into conflict with the creation of new technologies and research-technical possibilities, the modernisation of weapons, military and specialised hardware, and the strengthening of positions of Russian producers on the world market of weapons’. 55 With a long tradition in military high technology and active NT R&amp;D, there can be no doubt that Russia will be capable of using NT in various ways in the armed forces, should this become a high priority. </span><u>No hard information on military R&amp;D for NT in China was found</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>NT research</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in general </span><u>is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> very </span><u>advanced</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in China; centres have been set up in the Chinese Academy of Sciences and various universities. Chinese institutions participate in international collaborations, and international conferences have taken place in China. The government has set up a National Coordination Committee for nanoscience and nanotechnology; in the list of participating ministries and agencies, </span><u>no</u><u>defence-related institution was given explicitly</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 56 However, it is probably safe to assume that the wording ‘and so on’ comprises the Ministry of Defence or the Commission of Science and Technology for National Defence. Relatively </span><u>active</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in basic NT research and with expanding activities in military high technology at large, </span><u>China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is certainly </span><u>able to develop all kinds of military applications</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Of the more than 30 countries with NT activities or plans, or the </span><u>15 most active</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in publications or patents, many </span><u>will</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nearly </span><u>exclusively focus on civilian products</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and markets. E.g. </span><u>Taiwan and South Korea will</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> likely </span><u>continue their traditional economic path</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> into the NT era. </span><u>Japan is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> one of the biggest </span><u>players in civilian NT</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but has not been that active in military high technology in general. </span><u>This will probably hold for NT</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the future except if the general Japanese policy were to change.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Speculating about Russia’s and China’s expenditures, one can note that the </span><u>overall military R&amp;D budgets</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the two other official nuclear-weapons states UK and France </span><u>are about $ 4 billion and $ 3 billion per year</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, respectively, so that the NT-related expense given or estimated above is about one tenth of a per cent (it is 0.6 per cent for the USA with about $ 40 billion total). Assuming a similar ratio for Russia (total military R&amp;D about $ 2 billion) and China (roughly $ 1 billion), one arrives at NT-related figures of $ 2 million and $ 1 million, respectively. 59 Doubling or tripling would raise the numbers to the level of the UK. Summing all the mentioned countries and allowing 10-20 additional ones with on average $ 2 million/year would yield a </span><u>global expenditure outside of the USA of between $ 30 and $ 40 million per year</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If that were true, the </span><u>ratio between the USA and the rest of the world</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> would be </span><u>between 8:1 and 6:1</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As a more cautious estimate one can assume that the present spending ratio is between 4:1 and 10:1. However, the very </span><u>small relative portion in the military R&amp;D budget in all countries</u><u>indicates</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that there is </span><u>considerable leeway for increases</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – and experiences suggest that </span><u>expenses will</u><u>strongly</u><u>increase as technologies move</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from research to development, and again from there </span><u>to</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> acquisition and </span><u>deployment</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Given the tremendous potential benefits of nanotechnology, and the concern that it be developed with sensitivity to potential negative implications, the workshop participants offered the following recommendations: • </span><u>Make support for social and economic research studies on nanotechnology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a high priority. Include social science research on the societal implications in the nanotechnology research centers, and consider creation of a distributed research center for social and economic research. Build openness, disclosure, and public participation into the process of developing nanotechnology research and development program direction. • The </span><u>National Nanotechnology Coordination Office should establish a mechanism to inform, educate</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and </span><u>involve the public regarding potential impacts of nanotechnology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The mechanism should receive feedback from the nanotechnologySocietal Implications of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology 17 community, social scientists, the private sector, and the public with the goals of (a) continuously monitoring the potential societal opportunities and challenges; and (b) providing timely input to responsible organizations. • Create the knowledge base and institutional infrastructure to evaluate nanotechnology’s scientific, technological, and societal impacts and implications from short-term (3 to 5 year), medium-term (5 to 20 year), and long-term (over 20 year) perspectives. This must include interdisciplinary research that incorporates a systems approach (research-technology development-societal impacts), life cycle analysis, and real time monitoring and assessment. • </span><u>Educate and train a new generation of scientists</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and workers </span><u>skilled in nanoscience and nanotechnology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at all levels. Develop specific curricula and programs designed to: (a) </span><u>introduce nanoscale concepts into mathematics, science, engineering, and technological education</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; (b) include societal implications and ethical sensitivity in the training of nanotechnologists; (c) </span><u>produce</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a sufficient number and variety of well-trained social and economic scientists prepared to work in the nanotechnology area; (d) </span><u>develop</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> effective means for giving nanotechnology students an </span><u>interdisciplinary perspective</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> while strengthening the disciplinary expertise they will need to make maximum professional contributions; and (e) </span><u>establish fruitful partnerships between industry and educational institutions to provide nanotechnology students adequate experience with nanoscale fabrication</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, manipulation, and characterization techniques. • </span><u>Encourage professional societies to develop</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> forums and continuing education </span><u>activities to inform</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, educate, and involve </span><u>professionals in nanoscience</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and nanotechnology</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Guided by the goals of preventing the most dangerous military applications of nanotechnology, of designing limitations in such a way that they are adequately verifiable—in particular that usually observation without opening of weapons systems or magnifying equipment will suffice—and of not hampering beneficial applications of nanotechnology, I have arrived at the following recommendations [more detail in Ref. 6, Ch. 7]: </span><u>Ban on self-contained sensor systems smaller than 3 to 5 cm</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (with few exceptions). </span><u>Ban on small arms</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and munitions that contain no metal. </span><u>Ban on missiles below 0.2–0.5 m size</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ten-years moratorium on nonmedical implants and other body manipulation. </span><u>Ban on</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> reusable armed, mobile systems without crew, with numerical limits on unarmed systems. If that is not achievable, then at least prohibition of autonomous targeting and weapon release. Ban on small mobile, (partly) artificial systems below 0.2–0.5 m size, with strictly limited exceptions (e.g. for exploration of shattered or dangerous buildings). Comprehensive ban on </span><u>space weapons, with numerical limits on small satellites</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Chemical Weapons Convention should be upheld, the Biological Weapons Convention should be strengthened by a compliance and verification protocol. </span><u>Nanotechnology-based new agents should be included into the Conventions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>All these prohibitions should hold for the military sector</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and start at the stage of development. To prevent fast circumvention by modification of civilian systems, correspondingly adapted rules must apply also in the civilian sector. </span><u>Compliance can mainly be verified by on-site inspections in military installations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>training and testing grounds, but civilian laboratories</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, firms etc. </span><u>have to be included.</u><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Approximately </span><u>4,000 companies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and research </span><u>institutes</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> are </span><u>working on nanotechnology developments</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> worldwide. Of those, </span><u>1,900 are in the services industry</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and over 1,000 companies are manufacturing products. The </span><u>worldwide nanotechnology markets are</u><u>projected to grow</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from $300 billion in 2006 to more than a trillion dollars in 2015. 70 As of 2007, the leading nations in nanotechnology development are the </span><u>U.S., Japan, China, and Germany with China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> being one of the “world’s leaders in terms of newly established nanotechnology firms.” 71 </span><u>Russia just stood up their version of NNI</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and pledged over one billion dollars a year toward the initiative. The global requirement will be for two million skilled workers in the nanoscience and nanotechnology field worldwide with at least a third of those “needed in the U.S. to main global competitiveness.” 72 Sixty-three percent of U.S. business leaders in the nanotechnology field believe that the U.S. is the world nanotechnology research, development and commercialization leader; however, they contend that the lead is narrowing. 73 Using purchasing power parity exchange rates, in 2006 the top ten nations investing public funding into nanotechnology research and development in priority order were the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, India and Russia. The nation’s leading private sector investments in 2006 were the U.S. and Japan, together accounting for nearly three-fourths of corporate investment. 74 While the U.S. led all other nations in scientific journal paper publication in 2005 with 24% of the world output, China was the only major competitor coming in second with 12% of the world’s output. The </span><u>U.S. dominance remains today</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> but it also </span><u>represents a decline</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from publishing 40% of the world’s papers in the 1990s. The European Union led the U.S. in terms of quantitative analysis comparison of published papers but the European Union’s share is in decline. China’s share is rapidly increasing and is projected to surpass that of the U.S. if it has not already. The following chart indicates China’s growth in competitiveness, which has now surpassed the U.S.’ and Japan’s, both of which are on the decline. The nations with the highest commitment to nanotechnology were South Korea, China, and Japan with the European Union and the U.S. falling below world averages. A testament to the quality of research and development in the U.S., the papers from the U.S. were most frequently cited. Furthermore, the U.S. led in the area of patent grants. 76 According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, more the 4,800 patents have been identified under the nanoclassification heading. 77 Statistics tell only a part of the story. The </span><u>observations of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> space and </span><u>nanotechnology experts are</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><u>important</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to assess. The ongoing research and development, travels, and joint publications of these professionals provide critical insight into the capabilities of the competitors as well as the potential of future nanotechnology-enabled space systems. From the perspective of scientists and engineers at The Aerospace Corporation, a Federally-Funded Research and Development Center supporting the Space and Missile Systems Center, U.S. Space Command among other governmental organizations, the </span><u>U.S. is currently leading the world in government funded nanotechnology research and development</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and is </span><u>ahead in nanotechnology-enabled solar cells</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and structural materials. Dr. Donald A. Lewis, Principal Director of the Strategic Awareness and Policy Directorate (Project West Wing), and his team assess that </span><u>Japan</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is a major player in research and development and is ahead of the U.S. in nanotechnology-enabled battery development. 78 </span><u>China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is working diligently and deliberately in nanotechnology focused research and development while </span><u>Russia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is </span><u>not far behind</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<u>Preserving American Leadership</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">New York’s </span><u>leadership in nanotechnology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> directly </span><u>promotes U.S. competitiveness</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Right now, U.S. technological leadership is being challenged. While </span><u>semiconductor output</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is growing rapidly, the world market </span><u>is growing</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at an even more </span><u>rapid rate</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and </span><u>U.S. market share is declining</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, the U.S. is not keeping up with regard to </span><u>creating new and cutting-edge capacity</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The U.S. share of what the Semiconductor Industry Association classifies as “leading edge” chip production is declining. In fact, the Fab 4X facility is the only 300mm, 22nm fab currently slated to be constructed in the U.S. (The Luther Forest AMD facility will begin manufacturing product at the 32nm node, and will later move to 22nm technology as the availability of product designs, and customer demand move in that direction.) Other than for R&amp;D purposes, the last major 300mm production facility built in the U.S. prior to this one was built in 2007, and no others are now known to be contemplated. What is </span><u>technological leadership</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and why </span><u>is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> it </span><u>important</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Economists understand that an </span><u>economy cannot be “best” at everything</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But </span><u>being best at the right things is a critical part of maintaining the long-term U.S. standard of living</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Long-term leadership in the semiconductor industry is a matter of more than output and employment, although these obviously accrue to leadership. Leadership </span><u>allows</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> U.S. manufacturing </span><u>firms to set the research agenda</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for the global industry, and </span><u>lets the U.S. be the innovation leader</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for the entire semiconductor value chain, including not just production, but design and engineering and research and development. This is </span><u>critical</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to the U.S.’ long-term prospects </span><u>because</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> foreign </span><u>competitors have their own advantages</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, including the ability to imitate U.S. innovations. Moreover, </span><u>competitors may be advantaged by tax policies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, labor costs, or, as is sometimes alleged, </span><u>trade protection</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, corporate governance practice, or outright </span><u>subsidy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The only way for the </span><u>U.S. to sustain its competitivene</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ss, therefore, is to </span><u>stay ahead of its competition through innovation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. – to be the rabbit that the greyhounds chase but never catch. Industry leadership has other benefits. For example, the industry relies on a variety of engineering standards to which all firms comply, such as those of the International Standards organization regarding quality. The National Institute for Science and Technology plays a leading role in the promulgation of those standards, but only because of American technological leadership. Absent that leadership, influence over the development of industry standards could migrate to other organizations outside the U.S. </span><br />

<u><span style="color: black;">Nanotechnology is the frontier of innovation</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">; given its potential, it is not surprising that it is the </span><u><span style="color: black;">focus of a global scientific race</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. The </span><u><span style="color: black;">prize</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> for winning this race </span><u><span style="color: black;">is leadership</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> in the production of </span><u><span style="color: black;">renewable energy</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, clean water, cancer cures and </span><u><span style="color: black;">next-generation computing</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. The U</span><u><span style="color: black;">.S. government took an early lea</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">d in 2002 with the 21st Century Research and Development Act, which pledged $5 billion over four years to become a leader in nano science. </span><u><span style="color: black;">That lead has steadily been eroded</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="color: black;">Japan</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> announced an equivalent initiative within months of ours. Since then, France, </span><u><span style="color: black;">Germany, Britain, Russia, China, Taiwan, India</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> and Singapore have </span><u><span style="color: black;">stepped up to the plate</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> with significant investments.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">The 21st Century Research and Development Act expires this year, and </span><u><span style="color: black;">we have not been in a technology race this close since the Apollo project</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Given what is at stake and </span><u><span style="color: black;">the degree to which the U.S. relies on innovation to fuel its economy, nanotechnology is a global competition that America can ill-afford not to win.</span></u><br />

<strong>Nanotech for clean energy solves – 1AC author.</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif;">Lane and Kalil, 05</span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">[Neal Lane, PhD and senior fellow in science and technology policy at the Baker Institute, Thomas Kalil, Special Assistant to the Chancellor for Science and Technology at UC Berkeley, “The National Nanotechnology Initiative: Present at the Creation” Summer 2005]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">CMR</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Still, as a commercial enterprise, </span><u>nanotechnology is in its infancy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, </span><u>companies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> are still not able to reliably purchase high-quality nanotechnology building blocks such as nanotubes, metal oxide nanoparticles, and fullerenes. Whither the NNI? Although the NNI has made significant progress, we are concerned that federal funding for nanoscale S&amp;E has been flat in recent years. The administration’s FY 2006 budget, for example, actually proposes a decrease in funding as compared to the level of support provided by Congress in FY 2005. We believe that there is a compelling case for </span><u>sustained increases in federal funding for nanoscale S&amp;E</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, particularly if this is done in the context of increased investments in the physical sciences and engineering more generally. First, </span><u>federal agencies are</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> still able to </span><u>fund</u><u>only</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a </span><u>tiny fraction of</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">the meritorious</span> <u>proposals</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that are submitted. In its most recent solicitation for Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, for example, </span><u>NSF</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> received 48 proposals and </span><u>could fund only 6</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even when an agency does fund a proposal, the size and duration of the grant are often inadequate. Second, foreign governments are continuing to aggressively ramp up their investments in nanoscale S&amp;E. Given that international leadership in nanotechnology is up for grabs, </span><u>allowing U.S. funding to stagnate</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> while foreign governments continue to provide double-digit increases seems to us to be an incredibly risky strategy. Third, </span><u>only the federal government</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is in a </span><u>position to support</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the long-term </span><u>highrisk research</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that is beyond the time horizons of companies. Finally, researchers have demonstrated the potential of nanotechnology to make important contributions to a wide range of national goals and key economic sectors, such as health, clean energy, information technology, new materials, national and homeland security, sustainable development, manufacturing, and space exploration. Stagnant or declining budgets will make it difficult to pursue these and other opportunities. Below are just a few of the areas where new and expanded initiatives in nanoscale S&amp;E would make a big difference. </span><u>Invest in nanotechnology for clean energy.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Experts believe that </span><u>combating global warming may require</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u>ability to generate 15 to 30 terawatts of carbon-free energy worldwide by 2050</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. By comparison, today’s total global energy consumption is a little less than 15 terawatts. Considering that 85 percent of our current global primary energy consumption is from fossil fuels, this </span><u>is a daunting challenge</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Researchers have identified a variety of ways in which </span><u>nanotechnology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> could </span><u>help</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> solve our long-term energy challenges. These include a dramatic </span><u>reduction in the cost of photovoltaics</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, direct </span><u>photoconversion of light</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and water to produce hydrogen, and </span><u>transformational advances in energy storage</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and transmission. The United States desperately needs an Apollotype project to reduce the threat of climate change and its dependence on Middle East oil. Nanotechnology could play a key role in creating new sources of carbon-free energy that are competitive with fossil fuels.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nanotechnology in energy consumption</span><br />
<u>Transforming energy utilization</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and transmission – at the </span><u>heart of nanoscale behavior</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, one often finds emergent phenomena, in which a complex outcome emerges from the correlated interactions of many simple constituents. By </span><u>understanding</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the fundamental rules of </span><u>correlations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and emergence and then by learning how to control them, we </span><u>could produce</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for example, an entirely </span><u>new generation of energy utilization</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and transmission processes, such as in phase change materials for </span><u>thermal energy conversion</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, strong light-matter interaction and collective charge behavior for light emission nearing theoretical efficiency, and radically different combustion chemistry of alternative fuels. Understanding the emergent behavior of materials and </span><u>chemical reactivity</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the nanoscale offers remarkable opportunities in a broad arena of applications including solid-state lighting, electrical generators, </span><u>clean</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and efficient </span><u>combustion</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of 21st century transportation fuels, catalytic processes for efficient production and utilization of chemical fuels, and superconductivity for resistance-less electricity transmission.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In 2001, twenty-two percent of electricity used in the U.S., equivalent to eight percent of the nation’s total energy, was used for artificial light. Solid state lighting (SSL) modalities present an opportunity to achieve tremendous advances in energy efficiency (Nanocomposite solid-state lighting). By discovering and controlling the materials and nanostructure properties that mediate the competing conversion of electrons to light and heat, </span><u>nanotechnology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> will address the challenge of </span><u>converting</u><u>every</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> injected </span><u>electron into useful photons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The anticipated results are ultra-high-efficiency light-emitting materials and nanostructures, and a deep scientific understanding of how light interacts with matter, with broad impact on science and technology areas beyond SSL.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are other, more indirect – and only incremental – impacts that nanotechnology could have on energy usage. For instance, by using high-performance nanocomposite materials, cars and airplanes could be made much lighter, thereby improving fuel efficiencies. But the major improvement in the transportation sector will come once nanotechnology-enabled fuel cells have become commercially viable alternatives to the internal combustion engine.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The solution: Change the shotgun approach to nanotechnology funding</span><br />
<u>Nanotechnologies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> will have a major role to play in almost all future clean energy applications and that's why the scope – but not the scale – of the DOE's Energy Frontier Research Centers initiative seems such a good starting point. Add three zeroes to the current funding and you have the beginning of a promising energy initiative.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is no doubt that nanotechnologies </span><u>could provide</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u>solutions to</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> our </span><u>energy problems</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not today, and not tomorrow, but with a massive, coordinated and international effort a </span><u>10-20 year timeframe seems not unrealistic</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Today's various national nanotechnology programs fund their vast hodgepodge of research initiatives more from a viewpoint of basic research (or, in the case of the U.S., military wish lists) than with a focus on commercial implementation – in the process scattering funding resources by trying to cover each and every potential application.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Instead, the leading dozen or so nanotechnology nations should get together and commit to a concerted and massively funded 10-year program to develop commercially viable, </span><u>clean energy solutions based on nanotechnology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Rather than have bureaucratic government departments oversee the effort there should be a new agency – much like the can-do organization that NASA was in the 1960s – to drive this effort forward in close cooperation with academia and industry.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Not only would this </span><u>provide a way out of</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">the energy and</span> <u>climate crisis</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, it would finally provide the much-needed, large-scale commercialization of nanotechnologies that will lead to entirely new industries. The funding can be found, the technology can be developed, all it takes is political will...</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">One has to admit that the </span><u>chances of international agreement</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> along the lines recommended here are not too high. </span><u>The main</u><u>problem</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is </span><u>presented by the USA</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, already in its general tradition of </span><u>striving for a technological edge</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> over potential adversaries. The problem is aggravated by the present US administration with its questioning of arms-control treaties and preparations for preventive war.

There is no doubt, however, that </span><u>Russia and China are observing US developments carefully</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; it is reasonable to assume that </span><u>they could follow with only a few years delay should the USA decide to deploy new NT-based military systems</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nanotechnology is presenting a fundamental problem: How should humankind deal with revolutionary technology on the international level? One possible approach has been stated by the first US conference on converging technologies: ‘‘... reduce the likelihood of war by providing an </span><u>overwhelming U.S. technological advantage</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ... it is essential to be technologically as far ahead of potential opponents as possible.’’ [4, Section E]. This has a certain immanent logic, however, it </span><u>overlooks</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> two crucial issues: the </span><u>interactions in the international system</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the </span><u>dangers to the USA</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> itself </span><u>that could ensue in future</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Altogether a different approach would certainly be better, following the </span><u>goal of using</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the potential of </span><u>nanotechnology for humankind</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and prevent its dangers by global good governance. This means including the military applications into the international debate about nanotechnology and its necessary regulation. </span><u>Because of its technological lead and its political weight the USA have a key role in this</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Can it afford to engage in preventive limitation of its military technology? </span><u>For the foreseeable future there will be no serious technological challenge by a potential military opponent</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span><u>with</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its </span><u>intense</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> military </span><u>research and development the USA is organizing a virtual arms race with itself</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As a consequence </span><u>unilateral restraint would</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for quite some time </span><u>not lead to threats from opponent military nanotechnology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that would be </span><u>dangerous for the USA</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This could </span><u>buy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> sufficient </span><u>time</u><u>for</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the international </span><u>community to agree on adequate limitations that can be verified</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> reliably. Admittedly this needs the insight on the part of the USA that restraint and international limitation lie in its enlightened national interest. At least with the current administration such insight cannot be expected— however, the USA also has a certain tradition of mutual limitation of military capabilities, including new technologies. One can hope that the prospect of terrorist threats with nanotechnology-based biochemical weapons or micro-robots will promote this insight.</span><br />

<u>Small satellites do suffer from</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> some disadvantages. A primary disadvantage is that their smaller size limits their ability to </span><u>generate power</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There is simply </span><u>less volume in which to place batteries</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for power storage, and less surface area to employ solar panels for power conversion. This means they are </span><u>less capable of accommodating design demands</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> such as redundant systems, fine pointing requirements, onboard processing, and multiple payloads. The restrictions on power also limit their communications data rates and subsequently their missions. It is a major reason why small satellites are well suited for simple mission tasking. However, there are singular missions that small satellites cannot currently accomplish as well as larger satellites. Imaging is a mission that is severely hindered by the satellite’s small size. These small satellites have </span><u>limits to the size of the payloads that can be placed on them</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, the size of the imaging aperture that can be placed on a small satellite is smaller than what could fit on a larger satellite, and subsequently limits the obtainable resolution. Another aspect that is tied to the satellite’s power limitations is the orbit the satellite is placed in. With minimal capability to generate power, signals transmitted to and from the satellites are limited in their range. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is the primary orbit for small satellites due to this limitation. LEO has its own list of advantages, such as minimal range, and disadvantages, such as shortened lifetimes as compared with higher orbiting middle earth and geostationary/geosynchronous orbits. These advantages and disadvantages inherently belong to the satellites that reside there. As summarized by the Chairman and Director of SSTL, small satellite manufactures balance these advantages and disadvantages following the general principle of the 80/20 rule, 80% of the performance for 20% of the price [4][7]. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">That’s it. That’s what the whole book is. Oh yes, there are a few collections of intimidating tables and graphs purporting to indicate that such a thing might be possible, and Drexler does sketch out some impressive looking mechanical designs of what he supposes a nanobot might look like, but, without more than a passing justification. He seems to </span><u>lack</u><u>the imagination</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and of course, the </span><u>physics to figure out</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> what a real </span><u>nanosized doodad might look like.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Much of his thesis seems to be hand wavey arguments that his “looking rather a lot like a meter scale object” designs would work on a nano or small microscale. I know for a fact that they will not. You can wave your hands around all you want; when you stick an atomic force microscope down on nanosized thingees, </span><u>you know what forces they produce. They don’t act like macro-objects, at all</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Drexler would also occasionally notice that his perfect little robots would probably, you know, oxidize, like most reactive things do, and consign them to Ultra High Vacuum chambers in a fit of embarrassment. Then sometimes he would forget about the chemical properties of oxygen, and enthusiastically stick them everywhere. </span><u>None of the chemistry you’d need</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to figure out to even begin to do this </span><u>was done</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in his book. </span><u>Little</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> real </span><u>thought</u><u>was</u><u>given to thermodynamics</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or where the energy was coming from for all these cool Maxwell-Demon like “perpetual motion” reactions. It was never noticed that computational chemistry (aka figuring out molecular properties from the Schroedinger equation) is basically useless. </span><u>Experimental results</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> were </span><u>rarely mentioned</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or explained away with the glorious equation of Schroedinger, with which, all things seemed possible. Self assembly was deemed routine, despite the fact that nobody knows how to engineer such thing using macroscopic objects. There is </span><u>modern</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and even ancient </span><u>nano sized tech</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; lithographic </span><u>electronic chip features</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> are down to this size now, and of course, materials like asbestos were always nano sized. </span><u>As far as nano objects for manipulating things on nanoscales; such things don’t exist</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Imagining </span><u>self replicating nanobots</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or </span><u>nano machines is ridiculous</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>We don’t even have micromachines</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Mechanical objects on microscales do not exist. On </span><u>milliscales, everything</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that I have seen is </span><u>lithographically etched</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>or</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> made on a watchmakers lathe. Is it cool? Yep; it’s kind of cool. I have already worked for a “millitech” company which was going to use tiny accelerometers to do sensing stuff in your cell phone. Will it change the universe? Nope. Millitech miniaturization has been available for probably 300 years now (assuming the Greeks didn’t have it); lithography just allows us to mass produce such things out of different materials.</span><br />

<strong>NT helps oil ops, not clean energy</strong><br />
<strong>Oil and Gas, Eurasia 2011</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (April, “Nanotechnology to Boost Oil Recovery in Russia Up to 60-65 Percent.” <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oilandgaseurasia.com/articles/p/138/article/1473/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oilandgaseurasia.com/articles/p/138/article/1473/</a></span>) CMR </span><br />
<br />
<u>Nanotechnology</u><u>operations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for enhanced oil recovery (NTOEOR) </span><u>include operations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (methods, techniques) governed by nanoscale phenomena, or which employ nanoscale particles. The NTOEOR include, first of all, technologies based on application of thermo and physical fields, as well as biological substances. This group also includes technologies based on chemical and gaseous agents with nanoscale impact on the reservoir systems [2, 5, 6]. Some examples of modern NTOEOR include: [2, 6]</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 1. One problem in the oil and gas industry is </span><u>retaining</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u>reservoir features</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the bottom zone after production operations (pump change, BHT, timed well-kills, etc.). Every such operation can reduce well productivity by 20-30 percent. Hydrophobic emulsion enriched with nano-particle stabilizers boosts the density by changing the percentage of heavier additives in the water phase in the range of 1,050-1,500 kg/cu.m and has high temporal stability (over 40 days), up to +80 С heat resistance, more than 50 hrs thermal stability, and a low pour point (below –8 С).</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 2. Leakage of cement sheaths leads to premature access of bottom water into the production, gas-water-oil crossflow, pollution of fresh water horizons, etc. </span><u>Adding nano-dispersive</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> modifiers to cement </span><u>can enhance the strength of concrete and foam concrete</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 1.5-2 times. Advantages of nano-concrete conditioned on the specific structure formed by self-organization of cement stone at nanoscale levels. Proposed by the author combination of magnetic treatment for nano-concrete boosts quality of the material another 1.5-2 times.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 3. Foam systems stabilized by nanoparticles have proven highly effective in reducing the water cut in oil and gas production wells. In the oil industry, this </span><u>technology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has </span><u>been used in</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a number of </span><u>Russian oil fields</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and has proved </span><u>highly effective</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>achieving</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 15-20 percent reductions in water cuts and </span><u>1.5-1.7 times oil production growth</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as well as providing </span><u>500-10,000 tons of extra crude</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> per treated well. This technology (Fig. 1) was applied at the Urengoi gas field at 5 prematurely flooded wells for sand ingress prevention. The technological effect amounted to 16 million cubic meters per well.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 4. Thermogenerator systems are used for the thermochemical treatment of the bottomhole formation zone. Exothermic reaction of metal particles and alkali or acids produces up to 4,000 kcal per kilo of metal. In order for such systems to get deep into oil reservoir, size of the metal particles must be less than 50 nm, which is achieved by their encapsulation.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 5. Flooding is the most common domestic technology of oil displacement. Studies show that usage of special agents that sustain the permeability levels by preventing expansion (dispersion) of clay ensures retention or restoration of permeability after its fall [2, 6]. The conducted experimental field tests of this nanotechnology (NTOEOR) showed an </span><u>increase in injection capacity rates</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by average 27 percent [6, 7] (Fig. 2). Experiments show that the use of clay stabilizers significantly (10-15 points) increases the rate of oil displacement, resulting in 0.08-0.10 better oil recovery [6, 8].</span><br />
