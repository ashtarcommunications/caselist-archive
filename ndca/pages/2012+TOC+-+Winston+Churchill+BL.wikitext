===1AC Cites=== 

The author is dead
We are death and we have looked you in the face
We are death and this starts now
They will flee from us
But we have a meeting with the negative in rebuttals
And death always has the last word
“I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”
The problem is not that there is no value to life
But that there is no value to death
And that means something this time because Jack and I are death

Thus we present the following plan:

Of all the Gods, Death only craves not gifts:
Nor sacrifice, nor yet drink-offering poured
Avails; no alters hath he, nor is soothed
By hums of praise. From him alone of all
The powers of Heaven Persuasion holds aloof

As per Aeschylus [the only person in human history ever to be killed by a tortoise]

WE have a plan advocate.
From Irwin in Exercises in Inutility

I. Inner experience is a form of sacrifice…initiating “being without delay” (60)


How Hot is Trueblood? Death is seducing you. Orgasm is death.
Land 1992 [Nick, “The Thirst for Annihilation: Georges Bataille and Virulent Nihilism”, 191-192]

Bataille’s obsession is with “the unity of death, or of the…”The truth of eroticism is treason’ [X 170]


Death is the only impact we can come back from, I got 99 problems but my death aint one
Land 1992 [Nick, “The Thirst for Annihilation: Georges Bataille and Virulent Nihilism”, 180-181]

How much dying can a body do….that it has so little attachment to them


Buried under mountains of information, all the world has become a museum, which is dead
Baudrillard 1976, [Jean, “Symbolic Exchange and Death”, p. 185]

Pursue and censured everywhere…the point of no return when it is nothing more than a system of writing


We have shot-gunned monism, you must be able to prove that there are two things, but binaries are death, life is death is death is life, which is ultimately death
Baudrillard 1976, [Jean, “Symbolic Exchange and Death”, p. 188]

There is therefore no distinction….the dead and the living




=Round 4 - Neg vs RHSM NV= 
1NC:
Framework
Intrinsic - you don't have an intrinsic relation to your Aff, vote neg on presumption
Ocularcentrism Bad
Freedom
Bataille/"Scrambler"

2NC was Intrinsic and Framework

==Freedom==
The world has no guiding principle—the attemp to establish a political teleology to map the world only creates thesis and antithesis justifying predetermination and farclosure to the finitude of existence
DeBeauvior 1947 (Simone, french writer/philosopher, mostly a feminist, The Ethics of Ambiguity, Chapter Titled "The Positive Aspects of Ambiguity" translated by Bernard Frechtman)

the notion of...and absolutely confirmed


this creates the wrose of being---not even experiencing agonizing freedom isultra positivity of violence and tyranny which only corrupts politics.
DeBeauvior 1947 (Simone, french writer/philosopher, mostly a feminist, The Ethics of Ambiguity, Chapter Titled "Personal Freedom and Others" translated by Bernard Frechtman)

Yet, he exists...claims are absolute

==Ocularcentrism==

The term observation is a new term that entrenches the supremacy of the eye
Illich 1998 [Ivan, "The Scopic Past and The Ethics of the Gaze: A Please for the Historical Study of Ocular Perception", http://www.davidtinapple.com/illich/1998_scopic_past.PDF]

Gradually, during the sixteenth century....dominance over the other senses


Ocularcentrism is fascism
Fogu 2006 [Claudio, "Fascism and Philosophy: The Case of Actualism", p. 4-22: MUSE]

This is not the place to assess....in a more productive dialogue


Side constraint to voting Aff
Seem 83 [Mark, Intro to Anti-Oedipus, xvii]

To be anti-oedipal is to be....sick, so sick, of our selves!


==Scrambler==

From Irwin in Exercises in Inutility [Sands of the Impossible, 150-153]

I. Inner experience is a form of sacrifice…initiating “being without delay” (60)


Action mutilates the totality of our existence tapering off life in an attempt to reach a set goal. In order to totalize our freedom we must banish this slavery and immerse ourselves in the immanence of the moment, burning with desire for desire's sake
Bataille 45 [Georges, On Nietzsche, pg. xxvi-xxviii]

Nonetheless, I don't want my inclination...Entirety lacks further tasks to fulfill


Death functions in the reduction of things to inert objects of knowledge defined by their exchange value. Universal equivalence only proves no unique value. Information itself only serves as a testimony to the grand meaninglessness of our civilization. Buried under mountains of information, all the world has become a museum, death
Baudrillard 76 [Jean, “Symbolic Exchange and Death”, p. 185]

Pursued and censured everywhere…the point of no return when it is nothing more than a system of writing


The imposition of history is the deployment of an economy of victimization, an ethic of redeeming the past to cleanse negativity in the ultra positivistic fashion of society producing a hatred of the present and life
Baudrillard 2k5 [The Intelligence of Evil or The Lucidity Pact, p. 150-152]

Hence the immense syndrome of...deficits of the human species
