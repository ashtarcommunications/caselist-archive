**Contention one: Inherency**

**Obama has expedited approval for dredging projects, but not allocated funds—further action is necessary, but disad links are non-unique**
**Morgan and Rabin 7/19** – Miami Herald reporter, environment reporter (Curtis and Charles, “White House Speeds Up Permits, Offers No New Cash For PortMiami Dredge Project”, The Miami Herald, July 21 2012, [[http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/07/19/2902727/white-house-speeds-up-permits.html]])

The White House on Thursday … all remaining federal reviews.”

**And, it gave no guarantees**
**Dawers 7/19 –** Savannah Morning News (“Savannah harbor deepening among national port projects to be expedited by Obama executive order”, 19 July 2012, [[http://www.peachpundit.com/2012/07/19/savannah-harbor-deepening-among-national-port-projects-to-be-expedited-by-obama-executive-order/]])

We were already expecting … had been previously promised.

**And, the status quo shortchanges small ports**
**Bridges, 11** – Chairman of the Board of the American Association of Port Authorities and Executive Director of Virginia Port Authority (Jerry A., “Testimony of Jerry A.

Some may suggest … determining federal investment.

**Contention two: Trade**

**Panama Canal expansion means we are at a turning point in seaborne commerce—without harbor deepening, we won’t have access to post-Panamax ships**
**Bridges 11** Chairman of the Board of the American Association of Port Authorities and Executive Director of Virginia Port Authority (Jerry A., “Testimony of Jerry A. Bridges Chairman of the Board of the American Association of Port Authorities and Executive Director of Virginia Port Authority before the United States House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee Hearing: the Economic importance of Seaports: Is the United States Prepared for 21st Century Trade Realities?” , October 26, 2011, http://republicans.transportation.house.gov/Media/file/TestimonyWater/2011-10-26%20Bridges.pdf)

Since the birth of our nation, … We cannot wait.

**Two internal links—**

**First, spending is increasing but not for harbor deepening—lack of a firm commitment kills effectiveness**
**Szakonyi,12** – associate editor of the Journal of Commerce (Mark, “The Hill Ramping Up Dredging Efforts”, Journal of Commerce, 5/7, ProQuest)

The push by U.S. ports … meaningful long-term decisions.

**And, perception of federal funding commitment is key to competitiveness**
**Calhoun 11** President of Cargo Carriers (Cargill) and Chairman of Waterways Council, Inc (Rick, “DREDGING FOR PROSPERITY”, Marine Log, August, ProQuest, [[http://proxy.lib.umich.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/docview/889143450?accountid=14667]]”)

Just like the nation itself, … waterways transportation system.

**Second, current ports force light loading which destroys the industry**
**Weakley, 8** – Realize America’s Maritime promise, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Fairness Coalition, testimony of James Weakley the president of the Lake Carriers’ Association (James, “Realize America’s Maritime Promise”, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Fairness Coalition, 4/30/08, [[http://www.ramphmtf.org/speeches_043008.html]])

Port-related jobs are critical … merely for deficit reduction.

**Seaport competitiveness is key to economic growth—it’s key to a quarter of US GDP**
**Nagle, 11** president and chief executive officer of the American Association of Port Authorities (December 2011, Kurt, Industry Today, “Association: American Association of Port Authorities; Port-Related Infrastructure Investments Can Reap Dividends,” vol. 14, no. 3, [[@http://www.industrytoday.com/article_view.asp?ArticleID=F370]])

It seems the United States willingly …maintain federal navigation channels.

**And, increasing exports decreases the trade deficit and makes growth sustainable – prevents economic bubbles and collapses**
**Istrate et al 10** (Emilia Istrate, senior research analyst and associate fellow with the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative; "Export Nation: How U.S. Metros Lead National Export Growth and Boost Competitiveness", July, Brookings, [[http://www.brookings.edu/%7E/media/research/files/reports/2010/7/26%20mountain%20exports%20muro/0726_exports_istrate_rothwell_katz.pdf|http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2010/7/26%20mountain%20exports%20muro/0726_exports_istrate_rothwell_katz.pdf]])

Exports Could Contribute to … long-standing difficulties.

**And, expanding port infrastructure is vital to US global economic leadership**
**Kiefer et al, 2000** – principal investigator for Planning and Management Consultants– study authorized by Section 401 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1999, report to the US Army Corps of Engineers (Jack, Planning and Management Consultants, “The National Dredging Needs Study of Ports and Harbors Implications to Cost-Sharing of Federal Deep Draft Navigation Projects Due to Changes in the Maritime Industry”, May 2000, [[http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/docs/iwrreports/00-R-8.pdf]])

Indirect benefits of Corps projects … handful of coastal states.

**Two impacts—**

Two neatly opposed scenarios … rising influence and power.

Second, on a dyadic … an increase in the use of force.

**And, growth eliminates the only rational incentives for war**
**Gartzke, 11** – associate Professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego PhD from Iowa and B.A. from UCSF (Erik, "Security In An Insecure World" [[@http://www.cato-unbound.org/2011/02/09/erik-gartzke/security-in-an-insecure-world/|www.cato-unbound.org/2011/02/09/erik-gartzke/security-in-an-insecure-world/]])

Almost as informative as … war becomes a durable anachronism.

**Second is hegemony—boosting economic competitiveness solves war**
**Khalilzad 11** – Bush’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the UN and former director policy planning at the DOD (Zalmay, “The Economy and National Security”, National Review, 2-8-11, [[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/259024/economy-and-national-security-zalmay-khalilzad]])

Today, economic and … era of multi-polarity.

**And US pursuit of hegemony is inevitable—only a question of effectiveness**
**Calleo, 10** – Director, European Studies Program and Professor at SAIS, (David P, “American Decline Revisited,” Survival, 52:4, 215 – 227)

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">There was a clear discursive shift in Islamophobic discourse after … two Pakistani men were removed from a flight. 119</span>

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Specifically, airport infrastructure has come to be seen as the administrator of white Judeo-Christian security: it provides for this body a shield from perceived Islamic terrorists at the expense of Muslim Otherization</span>**

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">To many, complaints about such measures may seem trivial … response. And that's the point. </span>

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The airport’s Islamophobic identity policing is mirrored in the debate community – every tournament we fly to, we see Muslims discriminated against at the hands of the very transportation infrastructure for which we advocate in-round. Every weekend we step into the shoes of Congress and pretend to pass foreign policy regulating heg and terrorism. In doing so we necessarily affirm all the Orientalism of macropolitical institutions – debaters constantly advocate essentialist literature which would have us expand the United States’ imperial power over the Middle East in addition to describing Muslims as terrorists who irrationally loathe the United States as a result of their “inane” values</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Islamophobia has built cultural barriers all around us which manifest themselves in everyday discrimination against Muslims. We have all become complicit in the construction of misunderstanding and fear of Muslim culture – every time you vote for a terror scenario or a heg impact you always already assume a problematic understanding of Islam. The only way out is to question our cultural and educational practices – we must change the very way that we engage the Muslim Other in epistemology surrounding transportation infrastructure</span>**
