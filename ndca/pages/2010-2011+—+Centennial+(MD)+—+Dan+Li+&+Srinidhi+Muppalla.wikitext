**Victor-Ph.D. in Religion, Ethics, and Politics from Princeton University and is Former minister of the Reformed Church: BEYOND ONTOLOGICAL BLACKNESS: An Essay on African American Religious and Cultural Criticism**

**As a critic of the categorical and representational functions of ontological blackness … legitimacy from ontological blackness are at odds with contemporary postmodern black life.**

**D) Alternative is to embrace the “grotesque aesthetic”, a morally credible source to reconfigure Black religious and cultural criticism and adequately undergirds the rationality of difference.**

**Victor-Ph.D. in Religion, Ethics, and Politics from Princeton University and is Former minister of the Reformed Church: BEYOND ONTOLOGICAL BLACKNESS: An Essay on African American Religious and Cultural Criticism**

**Pressing beyond ontological blackness, chapter 4 explores … difference that is proposed in the new literary critiques of ontological blackness.**

**E) Must reach beyond aesthetic criticism, disclosing and subverting those cultural institutions and practices that undermine Black cultural fulfillment. This allows cultural criticism to be enlightening and emancipatory.**

**The Affirmative’s supposed resistance to war is the sign of potential combat of words – Their discursive armory is oriented towards exchange in the political sense.

**The inherent cooptation of power and knowledge will take the form of trickery.

**Our alternative – We will advocate absolute, irretrievable negativity, a form of nihilistic intervention into the realm of overwhelming action. Our criticism operates as a form of self-negating, inaccessible nothingness while the affirmative sharpens their knives on the simulated body of war.**

2. Standard for interpreting evidence – only official U.S. policymakers are credible sources. They are in charge of implementing the withdrawal and are the only ones with access to the truth. The 1ac evidence are from outsiders speculating about U.S. policy based on some remarks the military made after the Iraq election was inconclusive. 
C. Voting issue – 

1. no disad ground exists that competes off of the .01% chance that the U.S. doesn’t do the plan now. ALL link arguments are terminally nonunique because the aff IS status quo policy. 

2. mixes burdens – it’s impossible to determine whether the plan is topical in a vacuum. Mixing burdens makes the topic unpredictable and dependent upon effects-based evidence determinations – not the action of the plan. In practice, this means the aff will always win – because it’s a question of probability, and there’s always non-zero chance that the status quo might change.

3. even if they’re topical, they’re not inherent – they don’t have attitudinal, structural, or even existential inherency – because their plan is in existence now. This is independently a voting issue because ALL negative arguments and research strategies are premised on an affirmative change**.**
