<span class="Underline">**WITHOUT PLURALITY AND THE ABILITY TO DISAGREE, DEBATE BECOMES MEANINGLESS. WHEN UTILIZING VIOLENCE ,POLICY DEBATE AND PUBLIC DISCOURSE DEVOLVE INTO A COMPETITION FOR CONTROL OF THE GUN OF THE STATE. THIS:**</span>

<span class="Underline">**1) Eliminates debate as a concept, as all debate is reliant upon plurality and the moral right to disagree. Cross-apply our last Molyneux ’08 card talking about how the state is opposed to plurality and the ability to disagree.**</span>

<span class="Underline">**2) Is bad for education, as education in debate is based upon the ability to advocate a decision without fear of reprisal. If plurality is subject to the violent force of the state, we cannot be educated through debate, and public discourse devolves into a violent fight for the ability to aim guns at others to support a policy decision.**</span>

<span class="Underline">**REJECTING VIOLENCE IS GOOD BECAUSE:**</span>

<span class="Underline">**1) It allows us to examine solutions that do not involve coercion. The amount of affirmative and negative ground gained by the ability to advocate decisions not limited by the statist perspective.**</span>
