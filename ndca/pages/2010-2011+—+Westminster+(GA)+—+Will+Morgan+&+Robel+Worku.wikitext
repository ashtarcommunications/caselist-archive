The United States federal government should:

**--adopt a counterinsurgency strategy primarily centered on protecting the Afghanistan population, and provide all necessary resources to implement this strategy, including making the surge part of a permanent commitment to Afghanistan and clarifying that it has no withdrawal deadline**
**--freeze the size of its training commitment to the Afghan National Army and focus on training for quality over quantity, locating ANA divisions in their local provinces, and training an ANA helicopter division for mobile operations.**
**--neither implement rapid, large military withdrawals nor use an exclusive counter-terrorism strategy in Afghanistan.**
**--create a strategy for the development of the Modern Silk Road and generate incentives to invest in this project while pressuring local governments to decrease bureaucratic obstacles to trade.**
**--offer to substantially increase diplomatic rewards to Pakistan in exchange for cooperation against the Taliban and related insurgents.**
