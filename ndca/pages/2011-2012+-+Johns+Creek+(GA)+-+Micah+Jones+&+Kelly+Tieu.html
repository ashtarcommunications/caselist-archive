 <strong>We start with some background information: the history of space travel in the United States has been based off of a model that attempts to regulate which bodies should do what, this system was used to prevent the Mercury 13, a group of females from participating in early space exploration</strong><br />

The masculine self-identity of pilots has often been understood through an eroticized desire for risk and suffering, or what Law (2002) terms ‘Thrills and spills’ (p. 32). Similarly, McCurdy (1993), quotes one Apollo astronaut as saying, ‘Recognition of risk is what made us as good as we were’ (p. 62), while another states ‘But if it [risk of death] was like, one in one hundred, you would do it, you take it . . . There were so many ways it could happen’ (p. 63). Across such statements astronauts’ fetishized tolerance of risk as a part of the performance of manliness; risk became part of the astronauts’ identity, contributing to what Tom Wolfe's novel (1979) famously referred to as ‘The Right Stuff’. Yet this attitude towards physical and mental subjugation was not mere blind masochism; it was, also predicated upon a set of techniques concerned with the control of bodies wherein the astronauts were rigorously tested to confirm a high degree of corporeal control and calculation over their own bodies and perform tasks in this hostile environment – to maintain control in a situation despite the discomfort and vulnerability and get the job done. Within all these images of the astronaut there exist mutually shaping essentializing associations between masculinity, corporeality, outer space, risk and high-technology that prefigure the identity construction of ‘The Right Stuff’; becoming increasingly evident when challenged with transgressive Other(s), namely female bodies. 6 Such an instance occurred in 1962, when a small group of women successfully passed the some of same physical and psychological tests as the Mercury astronauts, in a privately funded women astronaut study organized by a physiologist called Dr. William Lovelace (see Shayler and Moule, 2003; Weitekamp, 2004). The women now sought NASA's support to become astronauts. ‘Lovelace's Women in Space Project’ (Weitekamp, 2004) or ‘The Mercury 13’ (Ackmann, 2004) de-stabilized many of the iterative bodily performances enacted through NASA that prescribed binary gendered assumptions. 7 The desire of these women to become astronauts and their embodied suitability, transgressed the tacitly masculinist spatio-temporal categorization of different bodies under modernity (Massey, 2005: 93). These bodies offered, in Judith Butler's (1990) terms, a sense of hope ‘in the possibility of a failure to repeat, a de-formity, or a parodic repetition that exposes the phantasmatic effect of abiding identity as a politically tenuous construction’ (p. 192). Just as some homosexual bodily performances may present a particular body in an opposing gender role (see Butler, 1990: 167–170), thus exposing the de-stabilized ‘ground’ of both gendered identities, these astronauts tacitly desired to place a female body in a hegemonically masculine guise. Yet equally, as Butler (1990) makes clear, such transgressions, while sometimes transformative, are frequently accompanied by ‘punishments that attend not agreeing to believe in them’ (p. 190). For example, in 1962 Dr. Lovelace sought the Navy's permission to expand his use of their facilities to provide further evidence of the women's suitability. The official reply to the Navy was that ‘NASA does not at this time have a requirement for such a program’ (Weitekamp, 2004: 128). This reply was then made known to Dr. Lovelace and the women involved; it effectively cancelled the nascent woman into space project. Here, the twin spectres of technological determinism and instrumentalism (Feenberg, 1999) are used to conjure up a belief in value-neutral, automatic and unilateral technical decision-making. In turn, this meant that the space programme could be constructed as if it were an inevitable temporal sequence, expressing natural gender roles and bodily practices, and devoid of ethno-political import (Shayler and Moule, 2003). The decision was re-examined in a heated Congressional hearing in July 1962, in which the Lovelace Women, led by Geraldine ‘Jerrie’ Cobb, were cross-examined by Congressmen partly in an attempt to illustrate their technical worth objectively, above and beyond their male peers (Shayler and Moule, 2003, p. 149). The women demonstrated the capacity of their bodies to pass the same flight-tests as men, as well as possessing some important advantages, not least their requirements for less food and oxygen – on account of their smaller size (Penley, 1997: 55). Ultimately, however, the women's transgressive bodily desires were blocked through quasi-judicial significations of risk. Namely, a belief asserted by NASA that astronauts had to be jet test pilots, a profession women were already barred from, because only jet test pilots possessed the necessary experience to undertake high-risk flight experiments. This point appeared already undermined by NASA's own demonstration that spacecraft could fly automatically in outer space (Penley, 1997), combined with the rejection of many skilled test pilots by the astronaut selectors, such as Chuck Yeager. NASA's Chief of Manned Space Flight, George Low, then explained to Congress how NASA support for the women-in-space project would set his work back, despite the fact that Lovelace had requested the very limited use of Navy not NASA facilities (Ackmann, 2004: 166). More implicitly, it appears the decision revolved around a belief that women were excluded from becoming jet test pilots (or astronauts) because it was deemed too risky (Weitekamp, 2004: 149). In this case, a masculinized relationship between technology and risk within American modernity proved intractable; accordingly men were able to dictate thresholds of female risk. As Weitekamp (2004) explains, the male construction of female risk prevalent in NASA was two-fold: on the one hand, NASA seemed reluctant to subject women to degrees of risk because ‘the prospect of subjecting a woman to mortal danger betrayed the rigidly defined gendered roles asserted in post-war America’ (p. 3). On the other hand, this paternalist designation of women as needing protecting might itself lead the public to conclude that if women flew in spacecraft then the craft themselves might be deemed too straightforward and safe. Thus as Weitekamp (2004) puts it, if ‘a woman could perform those tasks [it] would diminish their prestige’ (p. 3). The appropriation within NASA of risk as the legitimate means by which to exclude women from outer space appears only strengthened through its seemingly contradictory blending of different masculine identities. In this case, risk is alternately, and seemingly paradoxically, constructed as both a cipher for the rational management of hazards and the manly celebration of danger. Here the capacity to render masculinity fractionally coherent (Law, 2002) renders it more, not less, persistent in justifying patriarchal norms. The Mercury astronaut John Glenn, who had just returned back to Earth to a ticker-tape parade after being the first American to orbit the Earth, summarized his verdict in a final statement within the hearing: I think this gets back to the way our social order is organized really. It is just a fact. The men go off and fight the wars and fly airplanes and come back and help design and build and test them. The fact that women are not in this field is a fact of our social order. It may be undesirable (quoted in Weitekamp, 2004: 151). While Glenn's reference to ‘undesirable’ may be telling of shifting attitudes towards women, he nevertheless asserts that there is something inherently masculine about these interactions between bodies, risk and technology, so that only particular bodies were deemed not just more desirable but almost factually suitable. After the hearing, female astronauts were frequently the subject of further derision, often evoking the ‘heterosexual matrix’ of submissive female sexuality, as Wernher von Braun demonstrated in a speech given at Mississippi State College (19 Nov. 1962): Well, all I can say is that the male astronauts are all for it. And as my best friend Bob Gilruth [director of Johnston Space Center of manned spaceflight] says, we're reserving 110 pounds of payload for recreational equipment (from Parade Magazine Sunday Supplement, December 1962 – quoted in Kevles, 2003: 4).<br />

It is important to note that while normative gendered binaries continue to be performed within NASA into the 21st century (even in the accounts of women previously suffering from such narrow identity prescriptions), the enduring passion and skill with which many women invested themselves in spaceflight subverts many gender essentialisms, not least the premise that womanly and manly desires can only be understood through a neat heterosexual matrix of oppositions (Butler, 1990). Indeed, as Butler (2004) suggests, it is inaccurate to equate any measure of institutional identity with either strictly masculine or feminine identities, values or behaviours. Rather we should describe the ongoing dis/organization of normative gender practices and foreground those moments – as Carolyn Huntoon’s account might example – when the easy mapping of concepts of gender and sexual difference onto organizational and technical efficacy becomes problematic. The next section develops this line of thinking about transgressive desires and bodily competences by attending to a set of bodies that offered potentialities to throw into relief perhaps one of the most popularly understood ‘masculine’ technical environments: the spacecraft.<br />

Humans, suggests Crawford, 'bring speed, agility, versatility and intelligence to exploration in a way that robots cannot', justifying to many the employment of astronauts as 'field scientists' on other planets (Crawford 2005: 252). The consistent discursive articulation of outer space as a frontier, a 'threshold' for human intervention requiring the utmost in human performance, depends on a regulatory framework wherein 'humanity' is able consistently and without obstacle (material, psychological or otherwise) to seize the challenge of exploiting and controlling its natural environment and resources. Rarely conceived of purely in technological, aphysical terms, Space is a politics (in US discourse) entirely constituted in reference to the corporeal attributes of the (neo-liberally) human. Within the heteronormative, heterosexual, regulatory framework of US outer space discourse, the ideal, space-able, individual is constructed and reproduced within an unspoken but unequivocal heteronormative framework of reproductive sexuality, as a model that others should approximate: a person, evolved of heterosexual binaries, who is reactive but calm, reproductive but sexually restrained, agile but not hyperactive, versatile but not sexually ambiguous, rational but not mechanical, adventurous but competent (see, e. g. Seguin 2005). Located within a 'masculine context', such a framework has only solidified the sense of male bodies existing as the norm against which female bodies are evaluated, and male physiology the standard by which female bodies are judged (Casper and Moore 1995: 316-319). This regulatory masculinism has undoubtedly resulted in the overwhelming dominance of male astronauts in space. Although the first American female went into space in 1983, in 2001 of an active astronaut corps of 158, only thirty-five were women (NASA 2001), and of the 2004 class of astronauts, only two of eleven were female (NASA 2004). But the predominance of male astronauts also stems from the gendered nature of space discourse itself. The quest to conquer space that began with the Cold War 'space race' has long been coded (heterosexually) masculine, dependent on an articulation of masculine prowess realized through gendered assumptions of physical and technical expertise, strength, endurance and intelligence. The portrayal of the earliest astronauts as popular heroes in the US media, and beyond (Bush, for example, pays homage, in 2004, to two of the 'veterans' of the space age, Tom Delay and Senator Bill Nelson), sedimented an image of masculine achievement that, although highly contingent on the militarized aggressivity of Cold War discourse at that time, has proved enduring. Armstrong's famous announcement that the Apollo 11 Moon landing was 'one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind' thus in this instance speaks more specifically than universally, a continuation of the Western history's overarching belief in men's 'natural' ability, indeed prerogative, to conquer for the good of everyone.<br />

NASA, as a total institution, demands that astronauts subscribe to certain rules and discursive dictums. Even though these rules may be linked to critical issues concerning their survival, they are developed within a highly ideological milieu. NASA both exists as part of a broader social domain in which there are enduring beliefs concerning sexuality and also produces particular belief systems about sexuality. In addition, NASA as an institution exerts a great deal of control over what activities can be considered and pursued in the space environment, particularly in the &quot;closed&quot; space of a shuttle. What is witnessed in NASA's management of media attention is an effort to maintain ideological control over definitions of human sexuality; these definitions will precede us into the future . In short, privacy discourses used to divert continuing discussions of sexual desires and practices in space maintain a belief in the private, secret, and off-limits nature of human sexuality.<br />

From at least the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah, scenarios of same-sex desire would seem to have had a privileged, though by no means an exclusive, relation in Western culture to scenarios of both genocide and omnicide. That sodomy, the name by which homosexual acts are known even today to the law of half of the United States and to the Supreme Court of all of them, should already be inscribed with the name of a site of mass extermination is the appropriate trace of a double history. In the first place there is a history of the mortal suppression, legal or subjudicial, of gay acts and gay people, through burning, hounding, physical and chemical castration, concentration camps, bashing—the array of sanctioned fatalities that Louis Crompton records under the name of gay genocide, and whose supposed eugenic motive becomes only the more colorable with the emergence of a distinct, naturalized minority identity in the nineteenth century. In the second place, though, there is the inveterate topos of associating gay acts or persons with fatalities vastly broader than their own extent: if it is ambiguous whether every denizen of the obliterated Sodom was a sodomite, clearly not every Roman of the late Empire can have been so, despite Gibbon's connecting the eclipse of the whole people to the habits of a few. Following both Gibbon and the Bible, moreover, with an impetus borrowed from Darwin, one of the few areas of agreement among modern Marxist, Nazi, and liberal capitalist ideologies is that there is a peculiarly close, though never precisely defined, affinity between same-sex desire and some historical condition of moribundity, called &quot;decadence,&quot; to which not individuals or minorities but whole civilizations are subject. Bloodletting on a scale more massive by orders of magnitude than any gay minority presence in the culture is the &quot;cure,&quot; if cure there be, to the mortal illness of decadence. If a fantasy trajectory, utopian in its own terms, toward gay genocide has been endemic in Western culture from its origins, then, it may also have been true that the trajectory toward gay genocide was never clearly distinguishable from a broader, apocalyptic trajectory toward something approaching omnicide. The deadlock of the past century between minoritizing and universalizing understandings of homo/heterosexual definition can only have deepened this fatal bond in the heterosexist imaginaire. In our culture as in Billy Budd, the phobic narrative trajectory toward imagining a time after the homosexual is finally inseparable from that toward imagining a time after the human; in the wake of the homosexual, the wake incessantly produced since first there were homosexuals, every human relation is pulled into its shining representational furrow. Fragments of visions of a time after the homosexual are, of course, currently in dizzying circulation in our culture. One of the many dangerous ways that AIDS discourse seems to ratify and amplify preinscribed homophobic mythologies is in its pseudo-evolutionary presentation of male homosexuality as a stage doomed to extinction (read, a phase the species is going through) on the enormous scale of whole populations. 26 The lineaments of openly genocidal malice behind this fantasy appear only occasionally in the respectable media, though they can be glimpsed even there behind the poker-face mask of our national experiment in laissez-faire medicine. A better, if still deodorized, whiff of that malice comes from the famous pronouncement of Pat Robertson: &quot;AIDS is God's way of weeding his garden.&quot; The saccharine luster this dictum gives to its vision of devastation, and the ruthless prurience with which it misattributes its own agency, cover a more fundamental contradiction: that, to rationalize complacent glee at a spectacle of what is imagined as genocide, a proto-Darwinian process of natural selection is being invoked—in the context of a Christian fundamentalism that is not only antievolutionist but recklessly oriented toward universal apocalypse. A similar phenomenon, also too terrible to be noted as a mere irony, is how evenly our culture's phobia about HIV-positive blood is kept pace with by its rage for keeping that dangerous blood in broad, continuous circulation. This is evidenced in projects for universal testing, and in the needle-sharing implicit in William Buckley's now ineradicable fantasy of tattooing HIV-positive persons. But most immediately and pervasively it is evidenced in the literal bloodbaths that seem to make the point of the AIDS-related resurgence in violent bashings of gays--which, unlike the gun violence otherwise ubiquitous in this culture, are characteristically done with two-by-fours, baseball bats, and fists, in the most literal-minded conceivable form of body-fluid contact. It might be worth making explicit that the use of evolutionary thinking in the current wave of utopian/genocidal fantasy is, whatever else it may be, crazy. Unless one believes, first of all, that same-sex object-choice across history and across cultures is one thing with one cause, and, second, that its one cause is direct transmission through a nonrecessive genetic path--which would be, to put it gently, counter-intuitive--there is no warrant for imagining that gay populations, even of men, in post-AIDS generations will be in the slightest degree diminished. Exactly to the degree that AIDS is a gay disease, it's a tragedy confined to our generation; the long-term demographic depredations of the disease will fall, to the contrary, on groups, many themselves direly endangered, that are reproduced by direct heterosexual transmission. Unlike genocide directed against Jews, Native Americans, Africans, or other groups, then, gay genocide, the once-and-for-all eradication of gay populations, however potent and sustained as a project or fantasy of modern Western culture, is not possible short of the eradication of the whole human species. The impulse of the species toward its own eradication must not either, however, be underestimated. Neither must the profundity with which that omnicidal impulse is entangled with the modern problematic of the homosexual: the double bind of definition between the homosexual, say, as a distinct risk group, and the homosexual as a potential of representation within the universal. 27 As gay community and the solidarity and visibility of gays as a minority population are being consolidated and tempered in the forge of this specularized terror and suffering, how can it fail to be all the more necessary that the avenues of recognition, desire, and thought between minority potentials and<br />

Popular portrayals of American spaceflight regularly propose that the history of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration epitomizes the masculinist organization of American post-WWII modernity. Films such as Philip Kaufman’s The Right Stuff (and earlier book), or Ron Howard’s Apollo 13 (see Llinares, this volume), seemingly correlate the success of NASA, and by extension America and/or humanity, around the fortunes of strong, stoical, active and resourceful men. Meanwhile, women, such as the astronauts’ wives, seemingly feature as rather passive, marginalized and abjected. Manly bodies are shown here capable of ‘risk taking’, ‘frontier exploration’, ‘technical decision making’, ‘competition’ and ‘attention to detail’, all qualities which Connell (1995) suggested typified ‘hegemonic’ masculinities and legitimated patriarchies. Popular examples of NASA’s articulation of masculinist social power are complemented by various scholarly accounts explaining how NASA has historically subjugated women (Ackmann, 2004; Kevles, 2003; Moule and Shayler, 2003; Penley, 1997; Weitekamp, 2004). This chapter takes the underlying claim found within such studies – NASA articulated a gendered binary – as its starting point. Rather than foregrounding the stories of women in NASA as a revisionist counterpoint, as many of these studies have, I will go further and critically assess the disorganization of underlying binary oppositions which often frames explanations of the relationship between NASA and gender. Focusing on the activities of NASA, particularly during the Apollo era, I draw upon Butler’s (1990, 2004) work on the performed aspects of gender and identity, to question whether and how NASA as an organization is complicit with the rehearsal of gendered identities through polarized binaries that align ‘masculine’/‘feminine’ with ‘male’/‘female’? Butler’s work provides a particularly apposite starting point to address this question, as will now be elaborated prior to the empirical discussion. Gender as performance In contrast to a diverse group of feminist theorists, including Simone de Beauvoir, Kate Millett, Marilyn Frye or Barbara Duden, Butler rejects the idea that feminist epistemology and politics should or can differentiate a priori between identities, experiences, values or behaviours based on sexual difference (see Butler, 2004: 210–213). 2 Her critique of the universalism associated with feminist theory echoes some other scholars, including Julia Kristeva, Helene Cixous and Luce Irigaray. Butler (1990), however, goes further than multiplying the category ‘Woman’, and questions how gender/sexual differences are performed thorough a ‘heterosexual matrix’: ‘The heterosexualization of desire requires and institutes the production of discrete and asymmetrical oppositions between “feminine” and “masculine” where these are understood as excessive attributes of “male” and “female”. ’ (p. 24). She continues: ‘. . . one is one’s gender to the extent that one is not the other gender, a formulation that presupposes and enforces the restriction of gender within the binary pair’ (p. 30). Consequently, if gender is produced through binary oppositions then, for Butler, the ‘us’/‘them’ of ‘masculine’/‘feminine’ becomes unintelligible outside of these discursive practices and desires. As Butler (1990) puts it, ‘There is no gender identity behind the expression of gender, that identity is performatively constituted by the very “expressions” that are said to be its results’ (p. 41). Seven astronauts and their wives (see Figures 1 and 2). 4 Here the physical contrasts between the astronauts and their wives (clothing, hair-length, jewelry and make-up) are aligned with discursive binaries between men and women as public/personal actors. For example, the men are described as part of an ‘epochal mission’, seemingly conjuring up images of extensive heroism, while the focus on the wives’ ‘inner thoughts and worries’ returns us to ostensibly more ‘feminine’ interests. 5 Similar gendered contrasts are articulated in the The Right Stuff film adaptation of Tom Wolfe’s same-titled novel. In one scene, for example, the wives of prospective astronaut test-pilots sit indoors describing Importantly, Butler explains we should not abandon interest in the normative expressions of male/female binaries per se, rather we must be careful to view such ‘choices’ as repeated stylized acts regulated by regimes of truth (or discourses) and operationalized within institutions from the welfare state, modern medicine and perhaps also spaceflight, not part of any natural order of things (compare with Holmes, 2007; Parker, 2002). ‘To conflate the definition of gender with its normative expression is inadvertently to reconsolidate the power of the norm to constrain the definition of gender’ (Butler, 2004: 42). And so, while ‘Gender is the mechanism by which notions of masculine and feminine are produced and naturalized . . . gender may very well be the apparatus by which such terms are deconstructed and denaturalized’ (Butler, 2004: 42). Crucially for Butler, the contingency and transformability of gendering binaries becomes most evident in those situations when we feel unsure of the authenticity of a gender act, hence ‘Gender Trouble’ (Butler, 1990). Butler’s work has been of particular relevance to studies of transgender and homosexual cultures that accentuate the phantasmic construction of gender, by separating gender and biological sex, and thus challenging dominant regimes of truth around gender (see Parker, 2002: 152). Yet Butler (2004) argues that all gendered identities can be witnessed as phantasmic, because these ‘abstract norms’ always ‘exceed the lives they make – and break’ (p. 56). Butler’s passion for the mutability of authentic/fictional gender acts bleeds into her broader political strategy (Parker, 2002) as she seeks to concurrently describe and challenge the disciplining of modern beings through powerful regimes of truth and afford us more creativity to become (Butler, 2004: 175). Her celebration of transgression is, however, more than simply a multiplication of gendered identities; indeed as she explains, via Foucault’s understanding of power, transgression from a norm can equally help refine the disciplinary techniques by which any norm is produced (Butler, 2004: 52). There are resonances here with Law’s (2002) concept of fractional coherence that illustrates how postmodern reverence for multiplicity to resist modernist singularity – the modus operandi of much work on gender – often unhelpfully simplifies the nuanced practices through which gendered subjects are de/constructed. Arguably, the American space programme, especially during and before the Apollo-era, perhaps presents a rather strange association with Butler’s thesis – ostensibly it is permeated with repetitive gender acts where ‘authentically’ masculine men are opposed to feminine women, and has become somewhat of a leitmotif for the gendering of American modernity (Penley, 1997; Weitekamp, 2004). In many respects, however, such labelling only fuels the intellectual and political exigency for a more nuanced interrogation of some of the historical gendering practices surrounding space flight. Butler’s approach provides a useful frame in which a historical, largely text-based, analysis of gender can mitigate a tendency to assume a priori the coherence of essentialist gender roles. My decision to focus here primarily upon encounters between women and NASA develops Butler’s (1990) position that the category ‘woman’ articulates a conceptual fracturing of subjectivity – a fluid becoming not a fixed being (Grosz, 1994): women, as Butler (2004: 204–229) describes, are historically both inside and outside a politics based on group-recognition and representation. 3 Encounters between women and NASA can simultaneously expose and transform normative gender practices, disclosing the phantasmagoric de/construction of femininities and masculinities. Having introduced this performative approach, I will now turn towards three genderings within and surrounding NASA: (i) astronauts’ wives, (ii) women working within NASA and (iii) female astronauts.<br />

Lawrence D. Kritzman,prof of French and Comparative Lit @ Dartmouth, “Practicing Criticism”, Foucault: Politics, Philosophy, Culture, 1988. pgs 154-156<br />
FOUCAULT: First I’ll answer the point about “that criticism leads to nothing. ” There are hundreds and thousands of people who have worked for the emergence of a number of problems that are now on the agenda. To say that this work produced nothing is quite wrong. Do you think that twenty years ago people were considering the problems of the relationship between mental illness and psychological normality, the problem of prison, the problem of medical power, the problem of the relationship between the sexes, and so on, as they are doing today?Furthermore, there are no reforms as such. Reforms are not produced in the air, independently of those who carry them out. One cannot not take account of those who will have the job carrying out this transformation. And, then, above al, I believe that an opposition can be made between critique and transformation, “ideal” critique and “real” transformation. A critique is not a matter of saying that things are not right as they are. It Is a matter of pointing out on what kinds of assumptions, what kinds of familier, unchallenged, unconsidered modes of thought the practices that we accept rest. We must free ourselves from the sacrilization of the social as the only reality and stop regarding as superfluous something so essential in human life and in human relations as thought. Thought exists independently of systems and structures of discourse. It is something that is often hidden, but which always animates everyday behavior. There is always a little thought even in the most stupid institutions, there is always thought even in silent habits. Criticism is a matter of flushing out that thought and trying to change it: to show things are not as self-evident as one believed, to see that what is accepted as self-evident will no longer be accepted as such. Practicing criticism is a matter of making facile gestures difficult. In these circumstances, criticism (and radical criticism) is absolutely indispensable for any transformation. A transformation that remains within the same mode of thought, a transformation that is only a way of adjusting the same thought more closely to the reality of things can merely be a superficial transformation. On the other hand, as soon as one can no longer think things as one formerly thought them, transformation becomes both very urgent, very difficult, and quite possible. It is not therefore a question of there being a time for criticism and a time for transformation, nor people who do the criticism and others who do the transforming, those who are enclosed in an inaccessible radicalism and those who are forced to make the necessary concessions to reality. In fact I think the work of deep transformation can only be carried out in a free atmosphere, one constantly agitated by a permanent criticism. D. E. : But do you think the intellectual must have a programmatic role in this transformation? FOUCAULT: A reform is never only the result of a process in which there is conflict, confrontation, struggle, resistance…To say to oneself at the outset: what reform will I be able to carry out? That is not, I believe, an aim for the intellectual to pursue. His role, since he works specifically in the realm of thought, is to see how far the liberation of thought can make those transformations urgent enough for people to want to carry them out and difficult enough to carry out for them to be profoundly rooted in reality. It is a question of making conflicts more visible, of making them more essential than mere confrontations of interests or institutional immobility. Out of these conflicts, these confrontations, a new power relation must emerge, whose first, temporary expression will be a reform. If at the base there has not been the work of thought upon itself and if, in fact, modes of thought, that is to say modes of action, have not been altered, whatever the project for reform, we know that it will be swamped, digested by modes of behavior and institutions that will always be the same.<br />

While Foucault's genealogy of biopower is neither normative nor normatively neutral — to be either would result in being absorbed by normalizing power in the way that an analysis of power as repressive is absorbed — this does not mean that the analysis is not liberating. In revealing the way biopower operates in our practice, genealogy liberates not by releasing an autonomous self from repression nor through progress toward the achievement of the self as a goal. Instead it opens up the limit — that is, it prevents the closure of normalizing power, freeing us to create ourselves in our autonomy. ^ For Foucault. maturity is our permanent self-creation and liberation is the Nietzschean realization that everything is possible. This sense of maturity as our self-creation — which connects Foucault to Baudelaire's notion of the dandy — suggests an understanding of the achievement of our maturity that is not grounded in the humanist notion of man as an autonomous subject. This is apparently the theme of Foucault's last work in the series on sexuality — a project that was reshaped by his interest in the Greek concern with the techniques of self-care and self-mastery. In an interview with Dreyfus and Rabinow about this work, Foucault discussed the similarity between the problem we face in elaborating a basis for conduct and that faced by the Greeks. &quot;Recent liberation movements suffer from the fact that they cannot find any principle on which to base the elaboration of ethics. They need an ethics, but they cannot find any other ethics than an ethics founded on so-called scientific knowledge of what the self is, what desire is, what the unconscious is, and so on. &quot;30 What his work on the Greeks revealed was a response to a similar problem which did not turn on constituting the self as an autonomous subject and did not contribute to totalization and normalization. Though he is clear in the interview that he in no way proposed the Greek concern with mastery of self as an alternative to our current plight, it is also clear that he saw something preferable in it: &quot;I don't think one can find any normalization in, for instance, the Stoic ethics. The reason is, I think, that the principal aim, the principal target of this kind of ethics was an aesthetic one&quot;(230). In a similar way, the permanent critique of ourselves as a limit-attitude and a transgression of the limits opens up our possibility to will to live a beautiful life.<br />

<span style="font-family: 'times new roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Harry Hess, a Princeton Professor and Chair of the Space Studies Board at the National Academy of Sciences, adopted a similar approach to explain away female astronauts by stating unequivocally that ‘leaving the kids behind was not part of womanhood's idealized image’ (quoted in </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2009.01822.x/full#b21" rel="nofollow">Kevles, 2003</a><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">: 47). Ultimately, as </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2009.01822.x/full#b39" rel="nofollow">Weitekamp (2004</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">) surmised of the Apollo era: ‘NASA had no room in its mission objectivities for acting as an agent of social change’ (p. 157). Indeed it was not until 1978, and the development of the shuttle programme, that NASA would select women as astronauts.</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2009.01822.x/full#en8" rel="nofollow">8</a><span style="font-family: 'times new roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> <strong>By this point frontier analogies were being drawn upon retrospectively to excuse the omission of women from past astronaut selections; NASA's media rhetoric talked of the shift from explorers to pioneers, or from surveyors to homesteaders</strong> (</span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2009.01822.x/full#b21" rel="nofollow">Kevles, 2003</a><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">: 56). Making a similar nod to spatialized gender roles, Carolyn Huntoon, describes what she saw as the reasons behind the new policy for astronaut selections to the space shuttle: ‘It was going to have more space in it for the crews. It was going to have some of the conveniences of home that previous space capsules had not had. And the laws were changing in our country that women could no longer be discriminated against. The decision was made that we would select qualified women to fly in space’ (2002). <strong>Again the domestication of space missions appears to go hand-in-hand with the presence of women in outer space</strong>. In both cases, stereotypical gender roles, frequently made through a gendered (mis)reading of American frontier expansion in the 19th century, provided an ill-fitting though seemingly seductive temporal analogy to explain away almost thirty years of institutionally prejudicial accounts of bodily difference and space exploration. <strong>This re-telling of a spatial division of labour, as a teleological sequence, where male explorers precede female pioneers, reveals the way prescriptive bodily performances were retrospectively legitimated within a heterosexual matrix, even by women themselves</strong>.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The oldest and most basic of American national myths is the &quot;Myth of the Frontier,&quot; which sees the discovery</span>, conquest, and settlement of the West as the dominant theme of American history</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The historical basis of the myth is the 300-year history of westward expansion, from the founding of Jamestown in 1607 to the conquest of the Philippines in 1902. </span>According to this myth, the history of the frontier--the story of pioneers settling a natural wilderness and fighting wars against a racial and cultural enemy--explains the emergence of the US as a powerful, prosperous, and democratic nation. Most of the values we <span style="font-size: 7pt;">[End Page 472] </span>think of as distinctively American--rugged individualism, pragmatism, egalitarianism, a sense of &quot;Manifest Destiny,&quot; the idea of America as &quot;the last best hope of earth&quot;--have at one time or another been explained as the consequence of our frontier history. The persistent power of the myth is attested by the prevalence of the Western and its several spin-offs, like the hard-boiled detective story and the final frontier of science fiction, among mass culture genres<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The quotation I cited earlier on the Challenger disaster defines their &quot;immaculate&quot; mission as the &quot;perfectly American ambition to cross frontiers.&quot; </span>The Frontier Myth <span style="font-size: 7pt;">is a complex one, which I have dealt with at length elsewhere. But for this discussion there is one particular aspect of the myth that we need to bear in mind: in its original form, developed between 1780 and 1850, the myth </span>depicts America as a racial entity: a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant nation, which defines itself by destroying or subjugating a &quot;nonwhite&quot; enemy--Native Americans and Mexicans. Although African Americans were part of American society during this period, the myth treats them as internal aliens, &quot;others,&quot; and potential enemies of &quot;the white republic<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.&quot; In doing so, the myth reflects the reality of an American society which had adopted a &quot;whites only&quot; limitation of American citizenship. 9 In a myth, the patterns of narrative are the best guide to the cultural values the myth expresses. Political ideas, and concepts of the meaning and purpose of history, are indicated by the way in which characters in the myth treat one another and by the way in which certain kinds of action are seen to produce good results. </span>The central characters of the Frontier Myth represent parties to a racial conflict, and the narrative action of the myth tells us that such a conflict is inevitably violent. Social relations among whites are always seen to be based on mutual consent, and therefore democratic; but whites can deal with Indians only through force, by exterminating or subjugating them--that is, ruling them by force, without their consent. I call this concept the &quot;savage war&quot; myth, and it is an aspect of the Frontier Myth which is also a basic component of the post-World War II myth of multiethnic &quot;unit cohesion.&quot; The proper American use of force is dramatized in the myth through the character of the hero. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">The original heroes of the Frontier Myth were pioneer hunters and Indian fighters like Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett. But after the Mexican War of 1846-48, </span>when expansion became more dependent on military power, military events and professional soldiers became progressively more important figures in popular mythology. Whether in buckskin or army blue, the hero was always marked as &quot;The Man <span style="font-size: 7pt;">[End Page 473] </span>Who Knows Indians&quot;--he was seen as a man morally and spiritually on the border between savagery and civilization, with a &quot;dark&quot; understanding of the enemy, who redeems himself by putting his knowledge at the service of civilization<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The typical hero-story involves the rescue of a captive white woman, symbolizing the civilization that is to be saved from savagery. But the more spectacular and historically oriented hero-tales enlarge the rescue story to battlefield scale. The most mythologized military episodes of frontier expansion--the defense of Boonesborough (1777), the Alamo (1835), Custer's Last Stand (1876), the Charge of the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill (1898)--all have the same mythic structure: a small outnumbered group of white soldiers, led by a &quot;Man Who Knows Indians,&quot; defends America against a dark-skinned enemy.</span><br />

J.K. Prof @ U Mass Amherst, Queer(y)ing Capitalism in and out of the Classroom,<br />
<br />
Recently I attended a conference on globalisation and global regulation which was organised by some left social scientists at a university in the US. One thing I noticed in many of the contributions was the way in which everything was centred on or by capitalism, almost by default. Regulation was seen as focused upon capitalism and ultimately became part of a capitalist formation. Non-capitalist social sites (including the household and the state) were involved in the reproduction of capitalism, perhaps in new forms. Even opposition was situated within capitalism, de® ned and ultimately coopted by it. Over the course of the conference, what was incrementally produced was an image of a unified and univocal social space, the sort of thing that is called a `capitalist society’Ð or in this case a `global capitalist economy’ or just `global capitalism’ . It was clear to me that the researchers at the conference were disinclined to explore disharmony, incoherence and contradiction where capitalism was concerned. Yet all of us found the picture we had generated demoralising and depressing. This brought to mind what queer theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick has called the `Christmas effect’ . To Sedgwick’ s mind what is so depressing about Christmas is the way all the institutions of society come together and speak ª with one voiceº (1993, p. 5): the Christian churches, of course, but also the state (which establishes school and national holidays), commerce, advertising, the media (revving up the Christmas frenzy and barking out the Christmas countdown), social events and domestic activities, ª they all¼ line up with each other so neatly once a year, and the monolith so created is a thing one can come to view with unhappy eyesº (p. 6). Sedgwick points to a similar monolithic formation in the realm of expectations about sexuality where your biological sex, self-perceived gender, personality and appearance, the sex and gender of your sexual object (supposed to be not yourself and not the same as yourself), your sexual practices (including the privileging of certain organs and ori® ces associated with reproduction, or with insertion and reception), your sexual fantasies, and your principal emotional bonds and domestic arrangements are all expected to come together in predictable associations (Sedgwick, 1993, p. 7). Breaking apart these associations is the theoretical job of `queering’ sexuality and its representations. What I am cha® ng against, productively I hope, is a similar Christmas effect in social research and in the classroom, where things tend to line up with each other and speak with one voice (the univocality of a dominant or hegemonic formation). Just as the family is often claimed by heterosexuality (and a heterosexual family is presumed), so society is often claimed by capitalism. Images of a capitalist society are produced, including a capitalist state, a capitalist economy, capitalist reproduction, and subjective identitie s as workers and consumers in a capitalist social space. But Sedgwick’ s questions about Christmas, the family and sexuality suggest the possibility of other kinds of social representations: ªWhat if¼ there were a practice of valuing the ways in which meanings and institutions can be at loose ends with each other? What if the richest junctures weren’ t the ones where everything means the same thing?º (p. 6). More generally, Sedgwick’ s vision calls into question the project of representing societies and economies as hegemonic formations. What if we were to depict social existence at loose ends with itself, in Sedgwick’ s terms, rather than producing social representations in which everything is part of the same complex and, therefore, ultimately ª means the same thingº (e.g. capitalist hegemony)? What might be the advantages of representing a rich and proli® c disarray? I am particularly attuned to these problems and possibilities because I was myself a producer, in my earlier work as a teacher and researcher, of representations of capitalist hegemony. As a member of a large and loosely connected group of political economists who were interested in what had happened to capitalist economies following on the economic crisis of the 1970s, I had engaged in theorising and teaching about the ways in which industrial production, enterprises, forms of consumption, state regulation, business culture, and the realm of ideas and politics all seemed to undergo a change in the 1970s and 1980s from one hegemonic con® guration to another. It did not matter that I was very interested in the differences between industries or that I did not see industrial changeÐ even widespread changeÐ as emanating from or re¯ ecting a macrologic of `the economy’ . I was still representing a world in which economy, polity, culture and subjectivity reinforced each other and wore a capitalist face. Chasing the illusion that I was understanding the world in order to change it, I was running in a well-worn track, and had only to cast a glance over my shoulder to see, as the product of my analysis, `capitalist society’ even more substantial and de® nitive than when I began. In those exciting early days I had yet to take seriously the `performativity’ of social representationsÐ in other words, the ways in which they are implicated in the worlds they ostensibly represent. I was still trying to capture `what was happening out there’ , like the researchers at the conference. Students were drawn to the certainty and urgency of tracing the `emergence of global capitalism’ in particular industrial sectors and regions, and the classroom became a site where the new world order was critically `pinned down’ . At that point I was not thinking about the social representation my students and I were creating as constitutive of the world in which we would have to live. Yet the image of global capitalism that we were producing was actively participating in consolidating a new phase of capitalist hegemony [3]. Through my pedagogy and other forms of communication, I was representing an entity called the `global capitalist economy’ , and that representation was becoming common sense to a generation of students and activists. Over a period of years this became increasingly clear to me and increasingly distressing. My situation resembled that of the many other teachers and social theorists for whom the `object of critique’ has become a perennial and consequential theoretical issue. When theorists depict patriarchy, or racism, or compulsory heterosexuality, or capitalist hegemony they are not only delineating a formation they hope to see destabilised or replaced. They are also generating a representation of the social world and endowing it with performative force. To the extent that this representation becomes influential it may contribute to the hegemony of a `hegemonic formation’ ; and it will undoubtedly in¯ uence students, and other people’ s ideas about the possibilities of difference and change, including the potential for successful political interventions. In the classroom the excitement of `identifying’ global capitalism was increasingly tempered by the seeming futility of any form of resistance to it, and some students became exasperated and disillusioned by the project. A feeling of hopelessness is perhaps the most extreme and at the same time most familiar political sentiment in the face of a massive or monolithic patriarchy, racism, or capitalism. Perhaps it is partly for this reason that many social theorists have taken to theorising a hegemonic formation in the field of discourse (heteronormativity, for instance, or a binary gender hierarchy) while representing the social field as unruly and diverse [4]. A good example can be found in Sedgwick’ s opening chapter to Epistemology of the Closet where she counterposes to a heteronormative discourse of sexuality the `obviousness’ [5] of the great and existing diversity of people’ s relations to sex. In a simila r fashion, bell hooks (1992) sets a dominant phallocentric discourse of black masculinity (and black racial identity) against the diverse social ® eld of black masculinities and gender relations [6]. Like many political economists I had heretofore theorised the US social formation and `the global economy’ as sites of capitalist dominance, a dominance located squarely in the social (or economic) ® eld. But a theoretical and pedagogical option now presented itself, one that could make a powerful difference: to depict economic discourse as hegemonised while rendering the social world as economically differentiated and complex. It is possible, I realised, and potentially productive to understand capitalist hegemony as a (dominant) discourse rather than as a social articulation or structure. Thus, one might represent economic practice as comprising a rich diversity of capitalist and non-capitalist activities and argue that the non-capitalist ones had until now been relatively `invisible’ because the concepts and discourses that could make them `visible’ have themselves been marginalised and suppressed. In this project of discursive destabilisation, the first task is to undermine familiar representations of capitalism as the hegemonic form of economy, as necessarily and naturally dominant. This opens up a space for alternative economic representations, ones in which non-capitalist economic practices are visible and proli® c, and not necessarily subsumed to capitalist dominance. With students it is interesting to explore their own engagement in non-capitalist activities in their households and residential areas, or in student organisations such as cooperatives. On ® eld trips to regions traditionally de® ned in terms of capitalist industrial activities (such as mining or manufacturing) it is instructive to include local speakers from aboriginal economies or the voluntary sector to show how non-capitalist economic activities contribute to regional economic identity. And it is also useful to seek out contemporary illustrations of alternative economic practices that are currently viable. One classroom exercise that I have used successfully involves accessing the Web pages of alternative economic groups such as local economic trading systems (LETS), the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation, and the International Co-operative Alliance. Students often become inspired to research these examples of intentionally different economies in more detail and in the process become more aware of the diversity of economic practices that already exists. Finally, I sometimes offer a service learning course in which students volunteer to work for local cooperative enterprises and other alternative economic organisations. In addition to being exposed to the intimate workings of these organisations, students conduct interviews with members to further their understanding of non-capitalist practices. The ultimate aim is to engage students in producing a discourse of economic difference, in the hope of contributing to a politics of economic innovation. Of course, destabilising images of capitalist dominance is a big project, and I could not do it by myself. Nor could I do it without queer theory, that incredibly dynamic matrix of contemporary theory whose practitioners are not only theorising about queers but who are also making social theory `queer’ . This latter project can be seen to involve not (or not merely) constituting a minority population based on same-sex desire, set in opposition to a heterosexual norm, but calling into question the very idea of norms and normality, calling attention to the violence entailed by normalising impulses, including the impulse to theorise a social site as subsumed to a hegemonic order [7]. What if we were to `queer’ capitalist hegemony and break apart some of its consolidating associations? We could start by reimagining the body of capitalism, that hard and masculine body that penetrates non-capitalism but is not itself susceptible to penetration (this image conveys some of the heterosexism that structures contemporary social theory). One key `coming together’ (a Christmas effect that participates in consolidating a capitalist monolith) is the familia r association of capitalism with commodi® cation and `the market’ . This association, in which all three terms ultimately signify `capitalism’ , constitutes the body of capitalism as dominant and expansive (at least in the space of commodity transactions). But how might we re-envision that body as more open and permeable, as having ori® ces through which non-capitalism might enter? We might argue, as many have done, that many different relations of productionÐ including slavery and independent commodity production and collective or communal relationsÐ are compatible with production for a market. What violence do we do to these when we normalise all commodity production as capitalist commodity production? Surely the market is a mobile and membranous ori® ce into which can be inserted all kinds of non-capitalist commodities, whose queer presences challenge the pre-eminence of capitalism and the discourses of its hegemony. Queering our pedagogy means making differences visible and calling normative impulses and forms of social closure into question. This is something that geographic researchers are increasingly doing with respect to a wide range of social and cultural sites and processes, not excluding the `economic’ , where differences among industries, enterprises, economic subjects, cities and regions, national and world economies are often highlighted and explored. The fact that one sameness their capitalist nature tends to unify all these forms of difference offers a challenge to us as teachers. Can we, with our students, generate different representations of the economic world, ones in which non-capitalist class relations and forms of economy are prevalent and widespread? [8] If we can, what might be the impact of these representations? Might they not help to make anticapitalist activism seem less quixotic and more realistic? Might they contribute to a non-capitalist politics of economic invention? For queer theorists unwilling to accept that it is a `heterosexual’ world in which queers may gain a toehold but will still be ultimately marginal or minoritised, various forms of queerness are everywhere to be found. The domain of the `normal’ retreats to the social and theoretical horizon. Likewise, for economic theorists and teachers who wish to counter the normalising effects of discourses of capitalist hegemony, economic discourse may be hegemonised by representations of capitalist dominance, but the economic world is already queer. ªWe’ re here, we’ re not capitalist, get used to it!º [9]<br />

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The House Appropriations Committee proposed Wednesday to kill the James Webb Space Telescope, the crown jewel of NASA’s astronomy plans for the next two decades. The telescope, named after a former administrator of NASA, is the successor to the </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 16px;">Hubble Space Telescope</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">, and it was designed to study the first stars and galaxies that emerged in the first hundred million years or so after the Big Bang. It was supposed to be launched in 2014, but NASA said last year that the project would require at least an additional $1.6 billion and several more years to finish, because of mismanagement. The announcement of the telescope’s potential demise came as part of a draft budget for NASA and other agencies, including the Commerce and Justice Departments. In all, the committee proposed lopping $1.6 billion off NASA’s current budget, which is $18.4 billion for 2011. The Obama administration had originally requested $18.7 billion for NASA. Astronomers reacted with immediate dismay, fearing that the death of the Webb telescope could have the same dire impact on American astronomy that killing the Superconducting Supercollider, a giant particle accelerator in Texas, did in 1993 for American physics, sending leadership abroad. Canceling the Webb telescope would “have a profound impact on astrophysics far into the future, threatening U.S. leadership in space science,” said Matt Mountain, director of the</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 16px;">Space Telescope Science Institute</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> in Baltimore, which would run the new telescope. “This is particularly disappointing at a time when the nation is struggling to inspire students to take up science and engineering,” he added. Tod R. Lauer, an astronomer at the </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 16px;">National Optical Astronomy Observatory</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> in Tucson, echoed his view. “This would be an unmitigated disaster for cosmology,” he said. “After two decades of pushing the Hubble to its limits, which has revolutionized astronomy, the next step would be to pack up and give up. The Hubble is just good enough to see what we’re missing at the start of time.” The Webb telescope, he said, “would bring it home in full living color.”</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">This doesn’t make sense because most of the components of the JWST are finished and half of the funds are already spent. Cutting this program would only disappoint global partners.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Under the debt-reduction deal, across-the-board cuts to reduce discretionary spending would mean the cancellation of major scientific projects. In a newly released statement, the APS Executive Board expressed dismay that impending U.S. House action on appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies had identified the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as a prime candidate for termination. APS urges Congress to restore funding for JWST and believes it deserves special attention for the following reasons: Successor to the extraordinarily successful Hubble Space Telescope with similar potential to transform astronomy, JWST is the centerpiece of the future American space astrophysics program. It was the highest-ranked mission in the 2000 National Academy of Sciences' Astronomy Decadal Survey and is a cornerstone of the 2010 Survey. JWST is 100 times more powerful than Hubble and would revolutionize our understanding of the birth of the Universe, reveal much about the first stars and galaxies, and play a crucial role in the quest to find life on distant planets. Seventy-five percent of the JWST hardware is being fabricated or has been delivered, and $3.5 billion (about half of the total cost) has been spent. The Casani repor</span><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">t</span></strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">, commissioned by U..S. Sen. Barbara Mikulski (MD), found no technical problems, and NASA and its contractors have corrected management deficiencies that the report identified.JWST would continue Hubble's legacy as one of the greatest inspirations for young people and as a symbol of American leadership in science and space. Cancellation of JWST would eliminate thousands of high-tech jobs, especially in the aerospace industry. The Canadian and the European Space Agencies are contributing around a billion dollars to JWST; cancellation would again call into question our nation's record as a reliable international partner.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 16px;">But right now it’s a fiasco, costing at least four times its original estimate and scheduled to launch at least seven years late, threatening to drain funds from other critical space science programs amid ever-shrinking budgets. Those are the findings of a FLORIDA TODAY investigation that reviewed five years of project records, revealing an agency that continues to grossly mismanage major new programs. For instance, the shuttle fleet and International Space Station both came in far behind schedule, weighed down by 45 percent increases from their original price estimates, according to the Government Accountability Office, the financial watchdog arm of Congress. Ditto NASA’s Constellation moon program, which a presidential blue ribbon panel said was on a fiscally “unsustainable trajectory” that doomed it. And, just recently, NASA said the new heavy-lift rocket it wants to send astronauts on future deep-space missions from Kennedy Space Center would cost $9 billion and come in two years behind its mandated 2016 completion date. Now add Webb to the litany, its price rising from $1.6 billion to nearly $7 billion while its launch date moves past 2020. The damage to NASA’s credibility is severe and further reduces confidence in the agency’s ability to meet fiscal and launch targets for its post-shuttle manned spaceflight program.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The James Webb Space Telescope remains central to Nasa's mission, deputy administrator Lori Garver says. The agency chief was responding to moves in the House of Representatives to cull the troubled observatory, which is now $2bn over budget. A House appropriations panel has put forward a bill that would clip Nasa's 2012 budget and end JWST funding. But Garver told BBC News: &quot;James Webb is obviously part of our future that we believe very strongly in.&quot; She said the White House administration and the Nasa management would be working with the House and the Senate to produce a budget that would enable the agency to fulfil its science and exploration objectives. &quot;The process is not over,&quot; she added. Ms Garver was speaking here at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida where Nasa is preparing to launch its last ever shuttle mission. The JWST is supposed to be the next great undertaking in space astronomy. The telescope would have the biggest mirror ever sent into orbit and incorporate detectors capable of seeing the very first galaxies to form in the Universe. But getting it ready for flight has proved to be a major technological challenge. Uncertain timescale One recent assessment suggested JWST's total cost had ballooned from $3.5bn to $5bn, and that continued delays could inflate the final bill well beyond $6bn. In parallel with the price escalation, the probable launch date has slipped deeper and deeper into the decade with some commentators wondering whether JWST might not even be ready to fly this side of 2020. It is against this background that the House Appropriations Committee has drawn up it Fiscal Year 2012 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill. It calls for a $16.8bn budget for Nasa, which is $1.6bn below last year's level and $1.9bn below what US President Barack Obama would like the agency to receive. The panel would terminate funding for JWST if it had its way. But there is a long way to go in this story. The Senate will have its view, and then Congress as a whole will have to come to a determination. Nasa itself is conducting its own internal review of the JWST project. Ms Garver said she was hopeful that everyone could come to an agreement on the telescope's future. &quot;We absolutely do believe that we are working towards a budget that will deliver a James Webb telescope this decade. We are just now completing the bottoms up review of the cost to be able to get a funding profile to do just that.&quot; JWST is not a US-only project; it has significant input from the Europeans and the Canadians. Europe's contribution includes the launcher, an Ariane 5, to get the telescope into orbit, and the provision of two of the observatory's four instruments - MIRI and NIRSPEC. European Space Agency Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain was asked at the recent Paris Air Show about delays to the overall programme. He said Europe would continue working to its timeline and would not be distracted by the arguments over James Webb taking place in the US. &quot;We will be ready for a launch in 2016/17,&quot; he told BBC News. &quot;If the launch has to be later because Nasa doesn't have the financial wherewithal or the technical ability to go ahead in 2016/17 then we can put our instrumentation in storage pending a launch date. But I stress, we are not going to delay the delivery of our contribution because that would actually cost more, so we are going to finish our work as quickly as possible. &quot;Esa is not the bottleneck when it comes to the launch date,&quot; he added.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 16px;">The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will launch in 2018 only if NASA receives more funding for the program than the flat budget assumed in the President's FY2012 budget request according to an agency official. JWST is usually described as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, although it will study the universe in a different part of the spectrum (infrared instead of visible) and from a very different location (the L2 Lagrange point instead of Earth orbit). NASA's Rick Howard told the NASA Advisory Council's Science Committee on April 21 that the agency is still looking at how best to &quot;rebaseline&quot; the program to move forward. That effort will be completed in the coming weeks. Howard was designated as JWST Program Director last fall after an independent review faulted the program's &quot;budgeting and program management, not technical performance&quot; as the cause of substantial cost increases. That report said the earliest launch date was 2015 if certain financial resources -- $500 million for each of FY2011 and FY2012 -- were made available. Howard is doing a more detailed assessment and looking more closely at what funds are likely to be provided. Howard stressed that he is still gathering data to feed into the agency's Joint Confidence Level (JCL) independent cost estimating process before any decisions are made. The last three years of the program preparing for launch are &quot;incompressible,&quot; he said. If a launch date prior to 2018 is desired, the schedule could be moved forward only if more money is provided in the immediate future (FY2012 or FY2013). Absent such increases the agency is looking at 2018 as the earliest launch date, which is five years later than the original plan. Achieving the 2018 date also requires more funds in the longer term than what is in NASA's FY2012 projection. That &quot;runout&quot; shows the program flat funded at $375 million per year for the next five years. Howard said if that really turned out to be the budget for the program, launch would be pushed out into the 2020s. Howard said funding adjustments would have to be discussed within the agency and with the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Several committee members emphasized that programs like JWST cannot be accomplished with flat budgets and said they hoped OMB and OSTP realize that. NASA plans to spend $471 million on JWST in this fiscal year (FY2011) and Howard insisted the amount for FY2011 would not be lower than that. As an agency, NASA received $561 million less than the $19 billion it requested for FY2011. The agency is developing an operating plan to show how to plans to spend the approximately $18.5 billion that Congress provided. Howard clearly believes that JWST will not be a place where cuts are made to accommodate the lower appropriation. Meanwhile, JWST hardware is being delivered to NASA. One issue is how to store everything for this unexpectedly lengthy period of time and deal with obsolescence and workforce issues. Howard asked rhetorically how many of the people working on the program would want to stay with it now that the launch date is so many years later than planned. Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), chair of the Senate Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee that funds NASA, is a long time cheerleader for NASA and its space and earth science programs, many of which are managed at Goddard Space Flight Center in her State. She has been an ardent advocate for JWST, but her displeasure at the new cost overruns that emerged last year was made clear when she demanded the independent review that led to the current replanning effort (the &quot;Casani report,&quot; after its chair, John Casani). </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">WASHINGTON — The cost of NASA's replacement for the Hubble Space Telescope is giving new meaning to the word astronomical, growing another $1.5 billion, according to a new internal NASA study released Wednesday. NASA's explanation: We're better rocket scientists than accountants. Management and others didn't notice that key costs for the James Webb Space Telescope weren't included during a major program review in July 2008, officials said. The study says in the best case scenario it will now cost about $6.5 billion to launch and run the powerful, new telescope. And that can happen only if NASA adds an extra $500 million in the next two years over current budget plans. If the agency can't get the extra money from Congress, it will ultimately cost even more and take longer to launch the telescope. Before now, the cost of the telescope had already ballooned from $3.5 billion to $5 billion. NASA officials said they had not done a good job of figuring out the confirmation cost for the massive telescope. The report said the budget in 2008 &quot;understated the real requirements&quot; and managers didn't realize how inadequate it was. &quot;We were missing a certain fraction of what was going on,&quot; NASA associate administrator Chris Scolese said in a late Wednesday afternoon teleconference. The Webb telescope, &quot;we hope is just an aberration,&quot; Scolese said, but suggested there may be other budget-busting projects. He said the agency is now reviewing all its projects, not just to find extra money for Webb but to see if there are similar cases of poor budgeting. The costs aren't because of problems with the technology, design or construction of the instrument. NASA said, technically, it is in good shape. It is designed to look deeper in the universe to the first galaxies. A collaboration with the European Space Agency, the telescope is being built by Northrop Grumman and will be run out of Baltimore, Md., like Hubble. The fault &quot;lies with us, no question about it,&quot; Scolese said.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Managing costs on a year-to-year basis led to deferred work and life cycle cost increases. Inadequate reserves in the period immediately following Confirmation resulted in a nonexecutable Project. Without the reserves needed to fund the exigencies normally experienced in the course of development, the Project simply continued the practice of deferring some of the work planned in the current year to a future year. Due to the inefficiencies created when deferring already planned work, this led to escalating increases in the life cycle cost of JWST and continued erosion of the schedule. Experience shows that deferred work potentially doubles or triples costs, due to the impact of the deferrals on other work. This leads to a cascading effect wherein the cost of delayed activities further reduces the limited real reserves available to the project in later years, creating an escalating spiral for project life cycle cost. As the JWST Project was underfunded from Confirmation, the result has been a substantial impact to life cycle cost and schedule.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">The university needs science, but how much does science need the university? The university needs science because some 97.5 percent of the sponsored research funding flows to science faculty members. It needs science because graduate science departments attract the largest share of international students, many of whom come with external funding. It needs science because science is its last bastion of intellectual credibility. It needs science because the most potent rationale for continuing state and federal support is that universities drive technological innovation and jobs, and this claim rests almost exclusively on the contributions of university science faculty. It needs science because science departments are a magnet for many smart undergraduate students who wouldn’t come to seek degrees in other stuff. The university also needs science because most of the important frontiers of human knowledge are in the sciences. If the university wants to take itself seriously as an institution founded on the search for truth, it has to have a serious commitment to the sorts of truths that theoretical and empirical science aim to uncover. Science, on the other hand, could in principle get along without the university. It would be inconvenient for a while, especially for scientists who have built their careers around academic science. But there is nothing inherent in the nature of scientific inquiry that makes it dependent on the university. Science can be pursued in other venues: in government-run facilities such as the National Laboratories; in industry-sponsored facilities such as Bell Labs once was; in private industry; in international ventures such as the International Space Station; and sometimes as a purely personal pursuit. The latter is not to be treated at all dismissively. From Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton to Albert Einstein, breakthroughs have been achieved by individuals working well outside the university establishment and with little institutional backing. Today we have science entrepreneurs such as Craig Venter and Stephen Wolfram who step out of academe to found their own institutes to pursue their inquiries. And scientific publication doesn’t really need the university at all. Important results can be perfectly well vetted and disseminated outside the protocols of higher education, although the journal publishers would keenly regret the loss of income from university libraries and hefty public-dissemination fees. Science may not absolutely need the university but it does get some considerable benefits: systematic teaching and training of new scientists; career paths that allow for long timelines in developing ideas; an orderly system of funding and the social stability that comes from that; well-established and up-to-date facilities in an institution that understands the competitive need to keep them that way; and an infrastructure that typically includes things such as abundant high-speed computing. The university, in other words, is a very convenient place to pursue science. Many scientists like it, not least because they like the opportunities it presents to engage with colleagues in other disciplines, and because quite a few (certainly not all) scientists enjoy teaching. Have I missed anything? Perhaps it could be argued that the university’s role as a teacher and trainer of new scientists is irreplaceable—that science has reached the stage of complexity that no other institution could carry out this work at anything like the efficiency of the university. It is a reasonable argument but I don’t think it is quite right. The liberal-arts college, for example, often does an outstanding job of preparing undergraduates for graduate study in the sciences—and does so with only a relatively modest investment in the basic enterprise of science. If scientific research were to vanish from higher education, higher education could still manage to educate students to a high level of intellectual proficiency in chemistry, physics, biology, astronomy, geology, computer science, engineering, and so on. We might well lose something in that transition. Some active researchers who teach would find the research-less environment unattractive and de-camp, and students might find the absence of active researchers makes learning science a duller undertaking. On the other hand, a lot of college science is already taught by faculty members whose claim to being active researchers is very thin or trivial. So the loss could turn out to be minor. These ruminations are prompted by a couple of convergent thoughts: First<strong>,</strong> the United States seems to be entering a period in which its national commitment to major scientific undertaking is a bit shaky. A few weeks ago the Department of Energy confirmed that for lack of funds ($35-million per year) it is shutting down the Tevatron atom-smasher at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The closure will leave the U.S. without any major high-energy particle accelerator capable of new fundamental physics. The James Webb Space Telescope, intended as a replacement for the Hubble Telescope, is years behind schedule. Its cost overruns have forced other important projects, such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, designed to investigate “dark energy,” into long-term abeyance. President Obama cancelled the Constellation program that would have taken Americans back to the Moon. We have no practical replacement for the Space Shuttle program, which is down to two remaining flights. The government hopes the private sector will step in with some vehicle capable of reaching low-earth orbit so that the U.S. isn’t left buying expensive bus tickets on Russian rockets to heft our astronauts into space. In the other direction, the National Science Foundation just turned down additional support for the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory that would occupy the old Homestake gold mine in Lead, South Dakota—a project with potential to help in the search for “dark matter” and proton decay. The U.S. government continues to spend enormous amounts on scientific research but it is hard to avoid the impression that as a nation we have lost some of our real zeal for adventure. To be sure, there will always be more proposals for scientific research than the nation can reasonably pay for. We have to make choices, and a good way to do that is to think about the alternatives. Last year the National Academy of Sciences, for example, issued a </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 16px;">report identifying the highest priorities in astronomy and astrophysics</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">. Its highest priority was the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope—the one that NASA just pushed to the back burner. The cancellation and delay of so many key science initiatives inevitably means disappointment for academic scientists, and in some cases it will mean a good deal more than disappointment. Some research will simply stop, if not altogether at least in the United States.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Launch Date Uncertainty Though its promise is huge, researchers will have to wait a few years to put the telescope to use. JWST, long afflicted by budget overruns and delays, still has no estimated launch date, officials said in January at the American Astronomical Society’s winter meeting in Seattle. Last November, an independent review panel concluded that the telescope, once slated for launch in June 2014, could lift off no sooner than September 2015. But at a town hall-style talk in January, a NASA official stressed that that window is not binding. “There are a lot of steps that have to happen before the agency commits to a launch date,” said Eric Smith, JWST program scientist at NASA headquarters in Washington. “There is no such thing as a launch date for JWST. We’re working on it.” The JWST mission, led by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., is billed as Hubble’s successor. The telescope has huge light-collecting power: Its primary mirror is 6.5 meters wide, or more than twice as big as Hubble’s. While orbiting about 1.6 million kilometers from Earth, JWST will scan the universe in infrared light, helping astronomers study the early days of the universe, the formation of alien star systems and much more, NASA officials have said. Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST will not observe the universe in the visible light range of the light spectrum. NASA had estimated that JWST would launch in June 2014 and cost about $5 billion over its lifetime. But delays and cost overruns have long afflicted the spacecraft, which currently consumes 40 percent of NASA’s astrophysics budget. The independent review panel, convened at the request of U.S. Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) to look into the cause of JWST’s problems, concluded in November that the telescope would cost about $6.5 billion, and that it could launch no earlier than September 2015. The panel found no fault with the telescope’s scientific progress, instead citing longstanding budgeting and management issues. Indeed, JWST continues to move forward with its assembly and testing, officials said. Five of the telescope’s 18 gold-coated flight mirrors are completely finished and tested, for example, and the other 13 should be done by the end of this summer, according to Mark Clampin, JWST observatory project scientist at Goddard. “The bottom line is, we made really good progress in 2010,” Clampin said.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">The James Webb Space Telescope is a project of astonishing scientific capability that is the natural successor to the iconic Hubble Space Telescope. With 100X the power of Hubble, yet a comparable cost to launch,it reflects the huge technological steps that the US, and our international partners(Europe and Canada), have made in the last two three decades since Hubble was designed and built. JWST will maintain US leadership in space science and technology.The partnership for JWST with the European Space Agency (ESA), its member states and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) reflects the success of such past partnerships(e.g., Hubble) between NASA and these international agencies. JWST was the top ranked project of all projects, ground and space, in the 2000 US Decadal Survey, and is extensively acknowledged as a cornerstone of the next decade’s astronomical research in the 2010 US Decadal Survey (where it was understood for the report that JWST would become operational this decade). Furthermore, JWST is now the single largest investment by Canada in astronomy and a major investment by Europe, consistent with its very high scientific importance to each of their scientific and political communities. It is crucial for our international partners that JWST progresses expeditiously. Hubble, and the other ongoing Great Observatories (Chandra and Spitzer) have demonstrated the value and cost-effectiveness of broadly-capable space observatories through their wide-ranging and continuing scientific discoveries. Such Great Observatories have been shown to return discoveries very cost-effectively. The Great Observatories have also made a disproportionately large contribution to advancing public science interest and literacy (Hubble again is the pre-eminent example). Furthermore, the breadth of the science programs that such flagship missions can undertake, along with their ability to respond quickly to discoveries from other missions and observatories, makes them a truly unique scientific resource that benefits large numbers of scientists, their students and their postdoctoral researchers. Hubble’s role in the discovery of planets beyond our solar system, of dark energy, and of young galaxies looking back through 96% of time to just 500 Myr after the Big Bang are some of the many examples of forefront science areas that have touched the popular imagination. 2 JWST will play a similar role to Hubble, except that its dramatically higher performance will lead to an even broader range of studies and discoveries even closer to the cutting edge of astrophysical frontiers. The James Webb Space Telescope Advisory Committee (JSTAC) is an international committee of senior members of the scientific community who are experienced with large space projects and their optimal operation. Given the importance and cost of JWST, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Director set up JSTAC with the support and concurrence of NASA, ESA and CSA. The core focus of the JSTAC is to offer advice on maximizing the scientific return from JWST within its 5-year required life (10-yr goal). The JSTAC’s recommendations to the STScI Director are made available to the space agencies and are also made public to the science community (and all interested parties) through the STScI website. The space agencies are also cognizant of the JSTAC’s deliberations and recommendations through their ex-officio agency members. The JSTAC fully endorses the completion of the construction and the launch of JWST not only because it will dramatically increase humanity’s understanding of the cosmos, but also because it will continue Hubble's legacy of inspiring the next generation of scientists. JWST will also demonstrate technologies crucial for future NASA science missions of all sizes. The JSTAC is very concerned that recent funding and management issues during the development process for JWST may place the future of the mission at risk. The JWST Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) report provided a critical assessment of the recent management problems and budget issues in response to a letter from Senator Mikulski to the NASA Administrator. As the ICRP report noted, technical progress on the mission had been excellent but a number of issues have arisen that require additional funding to resolve. The JSTAC recognizes the fiscal challenges facing the US as well as the international partners, but asks for your support and that of OSTP to work with OMB and NASA, and ultimately Congress, to find a cost effective approach to bring this remarkable mission to fruition. The impact of not moving forward expeditiously towards launching JWST as soon as practical would reverberate far beyond the astronomical science community. The cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) had ramifications for US leadership in the physical sciences that is still being felt. The center of gravity of high energy physics moved to Europe. As a project of comparable scale and scientific importance, JWST is crucial to US scientific leadership both in science and through the visibility of its space program. US leadership in space has arisen through NASA’s human spaceflight program and through its stunningly successful and popular science missions. To abandon JWST at this time would not only have a dramatic impact on NASA’s science programs, but would also have a dramatic impact on US leadership in space.JWST, like Hubble, is a flagship program that has public visibility and scientific capabilities far beyond smaller missions. The cost and the risks of flagships are more than compensated for by the scientific and public interest returns. Our international partners are making very substantial investments in JWST, and are key partners for the US effort. The contributions of the European Space Agency (ESA), its member states and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) are central to the success of 3 the project. Europe is providing two scientific instruments, the launch vehicle and operations staff for the project at the STScI. In value, this contribution is equivalent to the total cost of a medium-sized space mission within ESA. The Canadian contribution of the critical fine guidance sensor and a further science instrument is the largest space science project supported to date by the Canadian Space Agency. The CSA also provides operations staff at the STScI. The international contributions have been essential for the development and implementation of the project and their contributions represent a major commitment of their resources towards a project that will do much to raise the visibility of the US and its technological capabilities. JWST is challenging but doable. No other nation could currently undertake a mission of the scale of JWST. JWST distinguishes the US technologically and scientifically, and is a striking example of US leadership in the field of space science. The JSTAC asks for your support in moving JWST forward expeditiously to launch. I would be happy to provide further information or a briefing on the importance of the JWST science mission from the perspective of the JSTAC.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Imagine for a moment that the globe is inhabited by a single individual who roams free across outback plains, through rainforests, across pure white beaches — living off the resources available. Picture the immensity of the world surrounding this one person and ask yourself, what possible impact could this single person have on the planet? Now turn your attention to today’s reality. Almost 7 billion people inhabit the planet and this number increases at an average of a little over one per cent per year. That’s about 2 more mouths to feed every second. Do these 7 billion people have an impact on the planet? Yes. An irreversible impact? Probably. Taken together this huge number of people has managed to change the face of the Earth and threaten the very systems that support them.We are now embarked on a trajectory that, if unchecked, will certainly have detrimental impacts on our way of life and to natural ecosystems. Some of these are irreversible, including the extinction of many species. But returning to that single individual, surely two things are true. A single person could not have caused all of this, nor can a single person solve all the associated problems. The message here is that the human-induced global problems that confront us cannot be solved by any one individual, group, agency or nation.It will take a large collective effort to change the course that we are on; nothing less will suffice. Our planet is facing several mammoth challenges: to its atmosphere, to its resources, to its inhabitants. Wicked problems such as climate change, over-population, disease, and food, water and energy security require concerted efforts and worldwide collaboration to find and implement effective, ethical and sustainable solutions. These are no longer solely scientific and technical matters. Solutions must be viable in the larger context of the global economy, global unrest and global inequality. Common understandings and commitment to action are required between individuals, within communities and across international networks. Science can play a special role in international relations. Its participants share a common language that transcends mother tongue and borders.For centuries scientists have corresponded and collaborated on international scales in order to arrive at a better and common understanding of the natural and human world. Values integral to science such as transparency, vigorous inquiry and informed debate also support effective international relation practices. Furthermore, given the long-established global trade of scientific information and results, many important international links are already in place at a scientific level. These links can lead to coalition-building, trust and cooperation on sensitive scientific issues which, when supportedat a political level, can provide a ‘soft politics’ route to other policy dialogues. That is, if nations are already working together on global science issues, they may be more likely to be open to collaboration on other global issues such as trade and security. Many countries have recognized the value of science diplomacy. In March this year, the US passed a bill to fund a Global Science Program for Security, Competitiveness and Diplomacy. Earlier, President Obama used his speech in Cairo to announce an expanded team of science envoys in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. In April, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband made the case for research as a political bridge. In Australia, there are two science envoy posts, one in Brussels and the other in Washington DC. In my own role as Chief Scientist, I engage with researchers and agency heads of other nations to improve Australia’s scientific relations. For example, my recent trip to the United States included a visit with Professor Daniel Kammen, Clean Energy Envoy of the US State Department, and previous trips have established a connection with Chief Scientists and Scientific Academy Presidents in Britain, China, India, New Zealand, and the United States. Central to these diplomatic efforts, is the establishment and continued nurturing of collaboration. Scientific collaboration operates best as a network of individual researchers supported by corporate and government policy and investment. The keys then are forging links at the ground level and providing clear and consistent bi-national and multi-national policy and funding frameworks to sustain these links. In Australia, we are in a unique position for international collaboration. Our relative geographical isolation and small world fraction has, from the beginning, necessitated self-reliance and native capacity-building on one hand and the need for strong couplings to the bulk of the world’s research overseas on the other hand. This means that we have strong and unique capabilities to bring to the table and also experience in sharing with and learning from others. Our vast continent stretches from the tropical north to temperate and semi-desert areas, and includes the Southern Ocean and Antarctic territories, a remarkable diversity of environments that are fundamental to understanding the diversity of ecosystems and interconnectedness of the Earth system. Medical research, dryland agriculture, climate science, water management, and tropical and marine ecosystems are just some of the areas in which the world relies disproportionately on Australian expertise. Increasingly, Australia is seen as an important player in the Asia-Pacific region and a link between the cultures of the Occident and the Orient, a powerful role in world diplomacy. As one single individual or one single nation, Australians and Australia is neither the sole cause nor the sole solution to global challenges. But by nurturing existing scientific collaborations and building new ones, we can build bridges of trust and cooperation that will allow a freer flow of knowledge and expertise to the benefit of our nation and our partners, benefit that would not accrue from unilateral action. This, coupled with supportive policies, goodwill, and a desire to use the strengths of our nation for the benefit of humanity will place us, as Australians, as leaders in international scientific diplomacy, and multiply our greater diplomatic efforts on the global stage.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">“American Leadership” is a phrase we hear bandied about a lot in political circles in the United States, as well as in many space policy discussions. It has many different meanings, most derived from cultural or political biases, some of them contradictory. The term sometimes arouses antipathy from non-Americans and from advocates of international cooperation. They may find it synonymous with American hubris or hegemony. It is true that American leadership can be used as a nationalistic call to advance American interests at the expense of non-American interests. But more often it may be used as an international call for promoting mutual interests and cooperation. That is certainly true in space, as demonstrated by the International Space Station, Cassini-Huygens, the James Webb Space Telescope, the Europa Jupiter System Mission, Mars 2016/2018 and Earth observing satellites. These are great existing and proposed missions, which engage much of the world and advance the interests of the US and other nations, inspire the public, and promote cooperation among technical and scientific communities worldwide. Yet space exploration and development are often overlooked in foreign relations and geopolitical strategies. Sometimes, the connection between space exploration and foreign relations has even been belittled in the space community. I refer to the NASA administrator’s foray into the Middle East last year, promoting science, math, and technology as a way to reach out to Muslim nations. It is true that he used some unfortunate wording, such as “foremost purpose,” but it was great that the administration wanted the space program to be part of its overarching international efforts to engaging the Muslim community in peaceful pursuits. Apollo and the International Space Station were both accomplishments motivated more by international and geopolitical interests than they were by space enthusiasm. It’s my view that space ventures should be used to advance American engagement in the world. (For example, with China on the space station and Russia in Mars Sample Return.) American leadership in space is much more desired that resented—except when it gets used unilaterally, as in the past Administration’s call for “dominance in cislunar space.” Asian countries (China, Japan, India) are especially interested in lunar landings; Western countries, including the US, much less so. However, cooperating with Asian countries in lunar science and utilization would be both a sign of American leadership and of practical benefit to US national interests. Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin has been a leader advocating such cooperation. At the same time American leadership can be extended by leading spacefaring nations into the solar system with robotic and human expeditions to other worlds. The US can’t do everything alone. Climate monitoring, Earth observation, space weather prediction, and ultimately asteroid deflection are huge and vital global undertakings that require international participation. That is also true with exploration projects sending robots and human to other worlds. American leadership in these areas is welcomed and used by other countries, even as they develop their own national programs. The US government should make more of this and not treat it as an afterthought—or even worse, prohibit American leadership as the House of Representatives is doing this week by banning any China collaboration or cooperation. (The proposed House continuing resolution for fiscal year 2011 prohibits OSTP or NASA funds to be used for anything to do with China.) On a bigger stage I was struck by the demands of the Egyptian protesters over the past few weeks for American leadership and engagement in reforming their country, while at the same time strongly resenting any American interference in their country. This demand for American leadership and opposition to American hegemony may seem inconsistent. It is not: it only emphasizes the need to recognize the difference and use leadership for cooperation and engagement. If we Americans do this in the space program, we will accomplish more in our many Earth, space science, and exploration projects, and we will raise higher the importance of the space program on the national and international political agenda.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 16px;">In 2009 global tensions create an atmosphere where nations increasingly test new defensive technology. In 2010 India explodes a satellite out of Low-Earth orbit (LEO) and the USA tests an orbital interceptor. Gazprom invests $1 billion in the development of a nanotechnology research lab. There is also a steady erosion of Outer Space Treaty norms and limits to protect commerce. By 2013 NATO is dissolved, seen as no longer relevant. The EU alliance shifts towards defending its borders. Human spaceflight continues, in an increasingly competitive atmosphere. The USA launches Aries I, with a crew. Generation Y seems more interested in environmental issues than space. By 2014 many nations begin deploying anti-satellite (ASAT) technology. In 2015 China, the USA, India and Russia field rival ASATs in orbit, as LEO orbits are at risk from debris. Commercial interests give up on LEO and eye the Moon, which fuels the race to establish a presence there. An increasingly protectionist USA leaves the World Trade Organization (WTO). In response, China recalls its debts from the USA. Meanwhile, European and Asian growth continues and, in 2018, a Chinese factory begins production of bulk carbon nanotubes. The USA and China race to produce the first space elevator. The civil lunar programs move forward. By 2020 a joint US–EU team land on and ‘reclaim’ the Moon. Lunar bases and the space elevator are established, as resources continue to dwindle on earth. Rival moon bases compete over mining rights and orbital lasers promote a defensive arms race in space. NATO is replaced by a new European Defence Organization (EDO). A coalition emerges, including the USA, the EU and India, in opposition to Russia and China. By 2025 African nations reject the influence of major powers and, thanks to the proliferation of technology, become space powers in their own right. In 2028 major powers withdraw from the Outer Space Treaty. Saudi oil fields are now officially empty, and the lunar colonies' major export is solar power. Military bases on the Moon defend against rival solar farms. A Russian–Chinese coalition attacks the space elevator, which essentially strands the US–EU lunar colonies and seriously impairs energy availability on Earth. The UN breaks down and is dismantled. Treaties are ignored and tensions increase. The earth is highly militarized, and conflict occurs both on earth and in space. The future is tense, dark and uncertain. By 2030 Californian scientists claim to have discovered an alleged artificial signal from outer space. The signal offers the possibility of a new reason for hope. 4.4. Group observations on Scenario A In this scenario technological breakthroughs add to the rule of force rather than providing a means for international cooperation. States come together and drift apart based on their perceived interests. The group acknowledged the importance of “giving teeth” to the Outer Space Treaty and other treaties in order to enhance means of overcoming conflict in the future. However, treaties do erode when states or blocs of states perceive these no longer to serve their interests. Further, norms of the Outer Space Treaty may be eroded through the commercialization of space, rather than by conflict and militarization. The group recognized that cooperation is possible on some, but not all, issues. Following the Chinese recent ASAT test there were efforts to clarify the situation for all parties concerned and prevent repeat occurrences. This suggests in part that the UN breaking down is not realistic, and that there might be greater political will to move in a collaborative direction than the scenario suggests. The competition for resources breaks down liberal order and traps states into a situation where the rule of force is perceived as the only option. In this scenario democracies are not less likely to militarize. Politicians bear the responsibility for the implications of their actions. NASA remains a remnant of the Cold War, while the EU space plan is geared towards a broader array of concerns. The voice of civil society is then squashed. (There is also an option of a scenario where, instead of the EU, China becomes a regional champion, bringing other regional leaders like Brazil under a new transparent framework.) The rule of force is also justified for the protection of investments. An entity such as the US-Soviet Standing Consultative Commission (SCC), which was convened when one side thought there had been a violation by the other, might be helpful. Driving factors come not necessarily from the bottom or the top, but rather from mid-level officials who can promote a discussion on the consequences of space weaponization. It is important to reach out to the non-space community, to help a wider constituency relate to the issues and take greater interest. Getting away from focusing on big, one-off, prestige programs is one way to elicit such an interest. Technological innovation, while important, does not necessarily lead to an advantage for the country of origin. Rapid dissemination of technologies among a certain community can affect the security of the countries of origin. For this reason, if weaponization of space is inevitable, countries should operate as much as possible in a collaborative, transparent fashion. This suggests the utility of a global regime controlling the technology. Cooperative leadership among youth could be developed to help ensure future cooperation. This group underlines the importance of reaching young people today in order to stimulate awareness in the next generation of leaders of the negative spirals that could develop. All parties must be made aware that it is in no one's interest to attack each other's satellites; both sides need the information and need freedom to access space. A non-interference pact could be developed, which might name the kinds of weapons not to be used.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">An unchecked race to militarize space is underway that is “increasing the risk of an accidental nuclear war while shortening the time for sanity and diplomacy to come into play to halt crises,” an authority on space warfare says. By 2025, the space capabilities of the leading space powers---the U.S., Russia, India and China---will be roughly equal “due to information sharing in a globalized economy,” says noted space researcher Matt Hoey in an exclusive interview. Hoey is international military space technology forecaster who provides analysis on issues related to technology proliferation and arms control. He is also a former senior research associate at the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies and has contributed to publications such as the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and the Space Review. Through their military and commercial research facilities, the world’s military powers are pursuing development of a reusable, unmanned, hypersonic, space-strike delivery platform that “would permit rapid precision strikes worldwide in 120 minutes or less,” Hoey said. The strike platform could loiter in near-space or in low earth orbit and assault terrestrial targets at incredible speed “with a nuclear or conventional payload and then return to any base in the world on demand,” he explained. While “there will not be a dedicated ‘space war’ in our lifetimes or our children’s,” Hoey said, “we are likely to witness acts of space warfare being committed…in concert with other theatres of combat” on land, sea, and air and cyber space.” Hoey said his research analysis suggests: “Back and forth escalation regarding military space capabilities would fuel each nation’s respective space industries as would commercial space races driven by national pride.” “If these systems are deployed in space we will be tipping the nuclear balance between nations that has ensured the peace for decades,” Hoey continued. “The military space race will serve the defense industry much like the cold war and this is already being witnessed in relation to missile defense systems.” Hoey pointed out the arms control community “is still trying to put the nuclear genie from decades ago back in the bottle” and adds “once this new genie(space war) is out it is not going back in anytime soon, either.” The five treaties governing space “are highly outdated,” Hoey said, notably the milestone “Outer Space Treaty” of 1967. Theoretically, the U.S. is also bound by The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 that declares our “activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.” (Rep. Dennis Kucinich(D-Ohio), in introducing a bill to ban the weaponization of space, charged the Bush administration with breaking with that policy by “putting weapons in outer space to give the U.S. the power to control the world.” Kucinich charged “the Air Force is seeking permission to put both offensive and defensive weapons in space.”) Hoey said the research community is expecting space warfare systems to come from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA) and the Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL). But instead of doing straight military R&amp;D in-house, the Pentagon is funding civilian research that has dual-purpose use capabilities---civilian applications as well as military. Because military space race technologies are the same as those needed to explore the heavens, service the international space station and defend against threats from near earth objects, the civilian-military partnerships “present the most challenging dilemma for the arms control community,” Hoey said. That’s because arms control proponents cannot object to their military applications without also opposing “technologies that benefit mankind.” And he warned this will continue to be the case as long as existing treaties fail to differentiate between commercial and military space technology. Because their overlap is “overwhelming,” Hoey noted, in that “systems that destroy can also create and facilitate discoveries,” it behooves the international arms control community to act before our military and commercial industries become “inextricably integrated with military space systems and unable to extract themselves.” Hoey said the defense community is actively scouting students still enrolled in high school who have demonstrated a talent in aerospace, cryptology and computer security for military research, “in an attempt to compete with emerging science and technology rivals such as China and India.” This would place future generations who dream of discoveries on a fast track towards the defense industry, Hoey said, even if they land jobs in the private sector. As dual-usage progresses, far more space technology roads will lead to careers that contribute to the development space warfare-enabling technologies. Companies engaged in nanotechnology, robotics and Artificial Intelligence are also being wooed by the military with fat checks, Hoey said. “These (space exploration and space warfare) systems are being developed through multi-tiered collaborations that include NASA, the Defense Department, universities, big defense contractors and small space start- ups. “The work force consists of military scientists and engineers, students, scientists, and even foreign nationals” ultimately enabling technology proliferation globally. For an arms control community that is focusing primarily on banning specific space weapons currently in development, nearing deployment, and in some cases already deployed, efforts should also be focused towards lobbying the international community to begin establishing rules of the road that differentiate between peaceful commercial space technologies and destructive military space applications before the lines between the two are irreversibly blurred, Hoey urged. By doing so, “next generation space warfare systems and space security threats can, as a result, be prevented long before they have a chance to further undermine peace in outer space and increase the probability of nuclear war,” he said.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">The latest U.S. House of Representatives appropriations bill seeks to cut funding for NASA by $1.6 billion, and in the process eliminate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project. While it is undeniable that the project has had large cost overruns and is behind schedule, it is also very clear that the project will once complete be a tool of enormous worth to the scientific community — and, through them, to the general population — not just in the U.S. but in the entire world. JWST was supposed to be finished by June 2014 and to cost about $5.1 billion. An independent review panel, however, last fall determined it would likely cost $6.5 billion and not be finished until September 2015. This is of course not a good thing, but it’s nothing new. In fact, there was a NASA project that was supposed to launch in 1983, but didn’t make it into space until 1990, and by the time it launched it had cost triple its original budget — about $11 billion in 2011 dollars. In the 21 years since its launch it has cost many billions more in servicing missions. I refer, of course, to the Hubble Space Telescope, whose cost overruns were outlined in a General Accounting Office (now Government Accountability Office) report in 1992 (PDF). Yes, Hubble has cost the U.S. a substantial amount of money, but its contributions to science have been of incalculable worth: the way we look at the universe has changed in ways we could never have predicted before the telescope’s launch. And JWST will be a much, much better telescope than Hubble, and not just because it has the benefit of decades-better technology. Not only will it be in a much higher orbit than Hubble, but it will be substantially larger and thus able to collect considerably more detailed and more distant observations. Scientists have some educated guesses as to what kinds of discoveries JWST could make, but it’s very likely that, as it was with Hubble, manythings it will find are so revolutionary they’re simply beyond our ability to predict. This would not be the first time Congress has struck down a major scientific project in the middle of its production. In 1993 Congress eliminated funding for the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) project because of predicted substantial cost overruns. The SSC would have, had it been completed, been nearly three times the size of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Europe and would have gone online considerably earlier. Who knows where particle physics would be today if the discoveries being made only now with the LHC had been made ten or fifteen years ago? And it’s not just the scientific discoveries made by the final product that are significant: There have been many technological advances made in the process of the telescope’s creation, just as there were when Hubble was constructed. It would be senseless to throw away the $3 billion already spent on JWST and to forego discoveries we can only imagine right now.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Chairman Baird, Ranking Member Ehlers, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to discuss science diplomacy at the U.S. Department of State. The U.S. is recognized globally for its leadership in science and technology. Our scientific strength is both a tool of “soft power” – part of our strategic diplomatic arsenal – and a basis for creating partnerships with countries as they move beyond basic economic and social development. Science diplomacy is a central element of the Secretary’s transformational diplomacy initiative, because science and technology are essential to achieving stability and strengthening failed and fragile states. S&amp;T advances have immediate and enormous influence on national and global economies, and thus on the international relations between societies. Nation states, nongovernmental organizations, and multinational corporations are largely shaped by their expertise in and access to intellectual and physical capital in science, technology, and engineering. Even as S&amp;T advances of our modern era provide opportunities for economic prosperity, some also challenge the relative position of countries in the world order, and influence our social institutions and principles. America must remain at the forefront of this new world by maintaining its technological edge, and leading the way internationally through science diplomacy and engagement. Science by its nature facilitates diplomacy because it strengthens political relationships, embodies powerful ideals, and creates opportunities for all. The global scientific community embraces principles Americans cherish: transparency, meritocracy, accountability, the objective evaluation of evidence, and broad and frequently democratic participation. Science is inherently democratic, respecting evidence and truth above all. Science is also a common global language, able to bridge deep political and religious divides. Scientists share a common language. Scientific interactions serve to keep open lines of communication and cultural understanding. As scientists everywhere have a common evidentiary external reference system, members of ideologically divergent societies can use the common language of science to cooperatively address both domestic and the increasingly transnational and global problems confronting humanity in the 21st century. There is a growing recognition that science and technology will increasingly drive the successful economies of the 21st century. Science and technology provide an immeasurable benefit to the U.S. by bringing scientists and students here, especially from developing countries, where they see democracy in action, make friends in the international scientific community, become familiar with American technology, and contribute to the U.S. and global economy. For example, in 2005, over 50% of physical science and engineering graduate students and postdoctoral researchers trained in the U.S. have been foreign nationals. Moreover, many foreign-born scientists who were educated and have worked in the U.S. eventually progress in their careers to hold influential positions in ministries and institutions both in this country and in their home countries. They also contribute to U.S. scientific and technologic development: According to the National Science Board’s 2008 Science and Engineering Indicators, 47% of full-time doctoral science and engineering faculty in U.S. research institutions were foreign-born. Finally, some types of science – particularly those that address the grand challenges in science and technology – are inherently international in scope and collaborative by necessity. The ITER Project, an international fusion research and development collaboration, is a product of the thaw in superpower relations between Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President Ronald Reagan. This reactor will harness the power of nuclear fusion as a possible new and viable energy source by bringing a star to earth. ITER serves as a symbol of international scientific cooperation among key scientific leaders in the developed and developing world – Japan, Korea, China, E.U., India, Russia, and United States – representing 70% of the world’s current population.. The recent elimination of funding for FY08 U.S. contributions to the ITER project comes at an inopportune time as the Agreement on the Establishment of the ITER International Fusion Energy Organization for the Joint Implementation of the ITER Project had entered into force only on October 2007. The elimination of the promised U.S. contribution drew our allies to question our commitment and credibility in international cooperative ventures. More problematically, it jeopardizes a platform for reaffirming U.S. relations with key states. It should be noted that even at the height of the cold war, the United States used science diplomacy as a means to maintain communications and avoid misunderstanding between the world’s two nuclear powers – the Soviet Union and the United States. In a complex multi-polar world, relations are more challenging, the threats perhaps greater, and the need for engagement more paramount. Using Science Diplomacy to Achieve National Security Objectives The welfare and stability of countries and regions in many parts of the globe require a concerted effort by the developed world to address the causal factors that render countries fragile and cause states to fail. Countries that are unable to defend their people against starvation, or fail to provide economic opportunity, are susceptible to extremist ideologies, autocratic rule, and abuses of human rights. As well, the world faces common threats, among them climate change, energy and water shortages, public health emergencies, environmental degradation, poverty, food insecurity, and religious extremism. These threats can undermine the national security of the United States, both directly and indirectly. Many are blind to political boundaries, becoming regional or global threats. The United States has no monopoly on knowledge in a globalizing world and the scientific challenges facing humankind are enormous. Addressing these common challenges demands common solutions and necessitates scientific cooperation, common standards, and common goals. We must increasingly harness the power of American ingenuity in science and technology through strong partnerships with the science community in both academia and the private sector, in the U.S. and abroad among our allies, to advance U.S. interests in foreign policy. There are also important challenges to the ability of states to supply their populations with sufficient food. The still-growing human population, rising affluence in emerging economies, and other factors have combined to create unprecedented pressures on global prices of staples such as edible oils and grains. Encouraging and promoting the use of contemporary molecular techniques in crop improvement is an essential goal for US science diplomacy. An essential part of the war on terrorism is a war of ideas. The creation of economic opportunity can do much more to combat the rise of fanaticism than can any weapon. The war of ideas is a war about rationalism as opposed to irrationalism. Science and technology put us firmly on the side of rationalism by providing ideas and opportunities that improve people’s lives. We may use the recognition and the goodwill that science still generates for the United States to achieve our diplomatic and developmental goals. Additionally, the Department continues to use science as a means to reduce the proliferation of the weapons’ of mass destruction and prevent what has been dubbed ‘brain drain’. Through cooperative threat reduction activities, former weapons scientists redirect their skills to participate in peaceful, collaborative international research in a large variety of scientific fields. In addition, new global efforts focus on improving biological, chemical, and nuclear security by promoting and implementing best scientific practices as a means to enhance security, increase global partnerships, and create sustainability.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 16px;">I closed my column last week saying, “Like the faded maritime powers of the 16th century, Russia is headed to be in space what Portugal and Holland became on the oceans: forgotten explorers. There is a lesson for the US here: Things can change quickly.” They sure do. Eleven months ago fans of space exploration cheered as President Obama, for the first time since John Kennedy, went on the road to support a program for a new venture of human exploration: “We’ll start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time in history. By the mid-2030s, I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth. And a landing on Mars will follow.” Then Congress went to work and, today, we have no coherent human space exploration goals, objectives, or program. We instead have a weak jobs program, spending money on a cancelled project and ordering a new rocket-to-nowhere project. In that same speech the president said, “We will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system” and “We will increase Earth-based observation to improve our understanding of our climate and our world.” In his very next budget submission last month, with still no budget passed by Congress for the current fiscal year, he proposed elimination of robotic precursor missions, a decrease in planetary science funding, and delays of vitally needed Earth science missions (a need which just increased as a result of the loss of Glory). All of the proposed increases that were submitted to Congress last year (and which they failed to act upon) are eliminated. In addition, the budget submission ignored the James Webb Space Telescope and the future Mars program—kicking the can of their consideration down the road. NASA is now not just paralyzed, but its vital signs are weakening. Later today the National Academy of Sciences Planetary Decadal Survey report is being released. The Survey was to evaluate a plethora of planetary exploration riches and decide priorities in order to reap rewards from a new era of exploration. International flagships would be sent to Mars and the Outer Planets while smaller ships were to continue making new discoveries throughout the solar system. Instead, as the report indicates, there will be no plethora of riches; we’ll be lucky to get a collection of rags. The Survey team accepted guidelines and constraints imposed by the agency for both cost and budget and came up with the inevitable result: we can’t continue Mars landers and we can’t have an Outer Planets Flagship. We will not search nearby worlds for signs of extraterrestrial life, and we’ll accept a new era with fewer missions and less science. Human space exploration was torpedoed last year. This year the robots are being fired upon. It is my view that without space exploration—new adventures to new worlds and scientific discovery about our universe—there will be little reason for NASA’s existence and the space agency will wither as its public support diminishes. I am not sure about the European reaction to the diminishing of plans for the joint Mars lander program and Outer Planets Flagship, but I am not optimistic about Europe’s independent ability to take over space exploration. Interfax reported this week that Russia has developed a “space strategy” that includes the exploration and development of the moon, Mars, and beyond. (Was this a reaction to my criticism of last week? I wish I had that power.) Maybe the tide will turn again—for as I said, things change quickly. Right now it seems that America is headed for exploration oblivion.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 16px;">&quot;When people think of NASA, they think of Mars Exploration Rovers or finding water on the moon, but a big part of our mission is to study earth from space, to advance scientific understanding and meet societal needs,&quot; Irwin said. SERVIR team members gather and process satellite data, combine it with ground observations, analyze results and quickly pass along the resulting information to assist scientists, educators and foreign government leaders. The SERVIR team is currently assisting the rescue effort in Haiti, using NASA and commercial satellite data to create maps of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. The data pinpoints the building-by-building damage caused by last week's massive earthquake. &quot;We are providing a bird's eye view of the heavily damaged areas, and making that information available to the response teams,&quot; Irwin said. In November, Hurricane Ida brought heavy rains that triggered flooding and mudslides in El Salvador, killing almost 200 people, leaving thousands homeless and causing more than $150 million in damage. The NASA satellite images provided by SERVIR mapped the mud flow and assisted officials in understanding the full extent of the hurricane's damage and how it could be avoided in the event of future disasters. That same month, a major algae bloom spread across Lake Atitlan, a picturesque Guatemalan lake surrounded by steep volcanoes and Mayan settlements. NASA's satellite images showed the scope of the contamination and helped mobilize government action to begin dealing with the pollution. In 2006, when severe weather caused flooding and landslides in Panama, the SERVIR team provided rain forecasts and damage projections, which prompted life-saving evacuations. In 2007, the system was utilized to assess the damage and chart six different disasters including forest fires in Belize and flooding in Mexico due to Hurricane Dean. Irwin, a native of Rockville, Md., created the SERVIR program in 2005 and today manages the operation from the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. SERVIR has a supercomputer center in Panama City, Panama, that integrates data from a variety of sources and displays real time mapping. The program recently opened a regional office in Nairobi, Kenya, as well. &quot;My vision is to create a sustained and strengthened capacity of the people in the countries where we work,&quot; Irwin said. Although NASA leads SERVIR, the U.S. Agency for International Development plays a key role in working with the various countries to use the data to bring about positive change. The Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey also offer indirect support to the program. Woody Turner, Irwin's boss at NASA's headquarters in Washington, said his colleague brings &quot;passion and high energy&quot; to the job and an unwavering commitment to help people in Central America and other developing regions of the world. He praises Irwin, a fluent Spanish speaker, for engaging countries around the world and giving them a major role and stake in the entire enterprise. &quot;Government sometimes gets a bad name, but government is made up of people, and there is no better example than Dan Irwin of someone who uses his position in government to help other people and to make a real difference,&quot; Turner said. &quot;Individuals do matter. Even with all of NASA's technical capabilities, this program never would have come together without Dan.&quot; Last year, Irwin had the opportunity to address the leaders of the Central American nations about climate change, showing them satellite data and images of deforestation in the region and illustrating the environmental problems those countries are facing. &quot;When I travel to Central America or Africa and meet with university professors, nonprofit organizations and government agencies, I get incredible feedback on how the NASA data has improved their decision- making, whether it involves deforestation, how natural disasters are affecting their countries or the research and modeling we have provided on air quality,&quot; Irwin said.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">In fact, when compared to all other environmental problems, human caused extinctions are likely to be of far greater concern. Extinction is the permanent destruction of unique life forms and the only irreversible ecological change that humans can cause. No matter what the effort or sincerity of intentions, extinct species can never be replaced. “From the standpoint of permanent despoliation of the planet,” Norman Meyers observes, no other form of environmental degradation “is anywhere so significant as the fallout of species.” Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson is less modest in assessing the relative consequences of human-caused extinctions. To Wilson, the worst thing that will happen to earth is not economic collapse, the depletion of energy supplies or even nuclear war. As frightful as these events might be, Wilson reasons that they can “be repaired within a few generations. The one process ongoing that will take millions of years to correct is the loss of genetic and species diversity by destruction of natural habitats.</span><br />

<strong>A Mars Sample Return mission is inevitable - NASA’s cooperation with the ESA will send the Aurora mission to Mars in 2018</strong><br />

<br />
In recent years ESA has increasingly used the name Aurora Exploration Programme, or simply Exploration Programme. Although human spaceflight has remained a long-term goal of the programme, with some basic technology development in this area, the thrust has been on implementation of the ExoMars mission and preparations for an international Mars Sample Return Mission. Due to funding shortages on both sides of the Atlantic, these plans for roboti c exploration of Mars are currently (2009) increasingly made in cooperation with NASA. At a meeting in Plymouth on 2009 June 29-30 ESA and NASA created a Mars Exploration Joint Initiative (MEJI) with the aim of planning collaborative Mars missions for 2016, 2018 and 2020, and leading to the return of samples from Mars in the 2020s[3]. The previous main effort of the Aurora Programme, the ExoMars mission, is not explicitly part of the MEJI collaboration and unlikely to be implemented as originally foreseen, but major parts of its science instruments are likely to be embedded in the MEJI collaboration. However, the Italian Space Agency (ASI), a major financer of the Aurora programme, has voiced scepticism regarding the proposed MEJI collaboration, in particular its lack of independent European demonstration of key capabilities for future planetary exploration[4].<br />

<br />
Cambridge, MA, March 21, 2011 – The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has awarded Aurora Flight Sciences a contract to develop a flight-quality orbiting sample (OS) detection and capture mechanism design based on research data and experience with the Mars Orbiting Sample Retrieval (MOSR) test bed. The contract leverages the state-of-the-art research into sample capture mechanisms, contact dynamics and capture mechanism detection methods and builds on Aurora’s experience with the Synchronized Position, Hold, Engage, and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) currently operating aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The Phase 1 effort will initiate a trade study to evaluate the use of the ISS as a system checkout and deployment platform for a risk-reduction test in LEO of the tracking, rendezvous and capture mechanisms. In support of these risk-reduction tests, Aurora will also examine the navigation and propulsion changes needed to enable SPHERES to operate outside the ISS. These efforts will provide the next steps in the transition of the knowledge and experience gained to date with the MOSR test bed towards a practical capture and containment system for use in Low Earth Orbit demonstration flights and Mars Sample Return objectives envisioned for later this decade.<br />

NASA's sole contender for a Mars Sample Return capsule is &quot;The Catchers Mit&quot; approach. NASA intends to return Mars soil samples in a basketball-sized container that will enter Earth's atmosphere without a parachute and impact a predetermined area in the Utah desert for pickup by awaiting specially trained biohazard troops. This design, officially known as Passive Earth Entry Capsule depends on everything working perfectly as planned. However, as NASA's loss of four Mars probes in 1999 prove -- there are no guarantee's when it comes to planetary exploration, things can and do go wrong.<br />

Several other notable scientists have said that they do not like the idea of a direct Earth-entry approach for MSR. Carl Woese, a Nobel Prize–nominated biophysicist at the University of Illinois, Urbana–Champaign, who discovered the third domain of life called Archaea, says, When the entire biosphere hangs in the balance, it is adventuristic to the extreme to bring Martian life here. Sure, there is a chance it would do no harm; but that is not the point. Unless you can rule out the chance that it might do harm, you should not embark on such a course (54). Chandra Wickramasinghe, professor of astronomy and mathematics at Cardiff University, Wales, is a leading proponent of the panspermia hypothesis, which holds that life on Earth was “seeded” from space, and has studied comets and interplanetary dust since the early 1970s. He said, I feel that there is no question that the examination of Martian soil samples must be conducted in situ on the surface of Mars or in a laboratory orbiting the Moon or the Earth to protect the Earth’s biosphere from any possible back-contamination hazards. We are really quite ignorant of microbial life on our own planet, let alone assuming that we know how microbes from another planet, such as Mars, would react here. The study of astrobiology and its implications is still in its infancy as a science (55). Former Viking biology team member Levin says, “I fear that, even if a safe MSR container could be made and brought to Earth, there is a good probability that some of the sample would escape from the ‘secure’ lab where the container would be opened” (56). Levin also questions the scientific benefit of MSR and says, “How could we get a living sample to survive the 9- or 10-month trip without knowing what any Martian microorganisms present in the sample need in the way of substrates, water, temperature, atmosphere, environmental cycling, etc.? Would we ever know whether it started out alive or dead?” He recommends a 10-phase approach to MSR based on his experience working with the Lunar and Planetary Institute and COSPAR (see box, “Safe methods for MSR”) (56). David A. Paige, associate professor of planetary science at the University of California, Los Angeles, was a co-investigator for the Mars Polar Lander Mars Volatiles and Climate Surveyor experiment. Paige submitted a scientific abstract to the Lunar and Planetary Institute Conference held in July 2000, in which he questioned the current wisdom of a faster, better, cheaper approach to MSR. In his abstract, he wrote (57), One of the most prominent aspects of the failed 1996–2000 exploration architecture plans was to accomplish the goal of sample return at the earliest possible opportunity. . . . For the case of Mars sample return, there has been a strong tendency to equate the analysis of returned samples with “good science”, and while it is undoubtedly true that one could do a lot of good science on returned samples, we are a long way from a situation where sample return is necessary to make further scientific progress towards the overarching goal of understanding whether life ever arose on Mars.<br />

<strong>The impact is the wipe-out of Earth – we have no defenses against potential space microbes</strong><br />

a. Back Contamination. &quot;For the public, the truly hair-raising danger comes from bringing alien material to Earth.&quot; n56 Although the scientific record is devoid of any proven example of backward interplanetary contamination, history does contain useful analogies for the arrival on Earth of extraterrestrial microbes. Intercontinental invasive species provide one parallel. n57 One of Earth's most infamous invasive species was Variola major, the virus n58 responsible for smallpox. n59 When European explorers crossed the Atlantic to reach North America in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, they brought the European cadre of microbial pathogens with them, including Variola major, which had long been common in Europe but was new to North America. n60 Variola major and the other microbes proved devastating. n61 Some scientists believe that smallpox and other illnesses caused by European microbes killed as much as 95% of North America's indigenous human population. n62 What made Variola major so deadly was the absence of local defenses against it. n63 In Europe, where the microbe had evolved alongside its host species for millenia, the hosts had evolved defenses to limit its deadliness. n64 Native Americas, however, had no defenses, and Variola major cut through them like a scythe. n65 [*1363] If a microbe from another planet arrived on Earth, the results could be as devastating to Earth's life forms as Variola major was to Native Americans. n66 If the newly-arrived interplanetary microbe proved parasitic, no life form on Earth would have developed defenses against it. n67 The microbe could then proliferate at the expense of native species-possibly humans or another species on which humans depend. n68 The effects of an extraterrestrial microbe might be even more devastating than Variola major's arrival in the Americas. n69 The almost supernatural potency of Variola major, an intercontinental microbe, was at least limited to the area outside of the region in which the pathogen evolved-i.e., Europe-because putative European hosts to the virus had evolved defenses to it. n70 A parasitic microbe arriving from a foreign planet might not be so restricted. A space-traveling microbe could conceivably wipe out an entire species or group of species, because no organism on the planet would have evolved defenses to the invader. In the words of one scholar, &quot;[w]hat if bizarre forms of pathogens exist on planets like Mars? Are we really prepared to bring them home?&quot; n71 Even if an extraterrestrial microbe did not affect humans directly, its effects could be deleterious to the environment. n72 Some scientists who consider it more likely that a foreign microbe could damage Earth's environment than act as a human pathogen have [*1364] described the specter of widespread environmental damage as the &quot;graver concern.&quot; n73 Again, the historical record of invasive species on Earth furnishes an example. American chestnut trees once dominated North America's eastern forests, shading the earth all along the Appalacians with their broad deciduous canopies. n74 A squirrel, it was said, could travel from Maine to Georgia without touching the ground by hopping from one American chestnut to another. n75 Today, the American chestnut has been &quot;virtually exterminated.&quot; n76 The exterminator was a fungus called &quot;chestnut blight,&quot; an invasive species from Asia against which the huge trees had no defenses. n77 Just as chestnut blight annihilated the American chestnut, an alien microbe could decimate the population of any living thing susceptible to it. Conversely, some scientists suggest that the arrival of alien microbes would be nothing new. n78 Scientists generally accept that when meteors or asteroids strike planets, the tremendous impact force can fling chunks of rock and other debris into outer space. n79 These rocks can travel between planets and plunk down someplace new. n80 Some scientists speculate that the space-traveling rocks could have contained microbial life and may have naturally facilitated the interplanetary travel of microbes. n81 Scientists also generally accept that &quot;solar wind ions&quot;-i.e., winds of charged particles emanating from the sun n82 -could have brought foreign [*1365] material into Earth's atmosphere, although the likelihood of &quot;contamination&quot; from solar winds is low. n83 Despite suspicions that extraterrestrial microbes have previously arrived on Earth, there is a strong scientific consensus that spacefaring nations should take careful precautions to avoid back contamination. n84 Even if an extraterrestrial microbe has previously arrived on Earth without causing damage, a subsequently arriving microbe could produce very different results. The example of Variola major is again illustrative. Although their arrival precipitated the death of most then-living American natives, the European explorers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries who carried Variola major were not the first Europeans to visit the Americas. Historians have revealed that Norse sailors reached and explored coastal areas of northern North America almost 500 years before Christopher Columbus made his famous voyage. n85 Although these early Norse sailors had contact with Native Americans through battle and trade, exposing the natives to European germs, the natives experienced no massive dieoff-in fact, they remained strong enough to expel the Norse from the continent. n86 The death wave that rocked the Americas' native population came several centuries later. n87 Although Native Americans' first exposure to European germs seemed innocuous, a subsequent exposure to European explorers and conquistadors like Columbus and Cortez would kill 95% of the Native American population. n88 Similarly, even if Earth's ecosystems have already been exposed to an extraterrestrial microbe, a second exposure could prove deadly.<br />

<strong>AND - The MSR spacecraft will be powered by RTGs – re-entry accident or crash landing risks the death of millions</strong><br />
<strong>Rodrigue 2</strong> [Christine M. Rodrigue - Professor and Chair Department of Geography California State University, “Emerging Risk Assessment and Management Controversies in the Mars Sample Return”, July 2002, <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.csulb.edu/~rodrigue/bldrmars.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.csulb.edu/~rodrigue/bldrmars.html</a></span>, Chetan]<br />
<br />
For a number of years, I have investigated the risk assessment and risk management controversy surrounding NASA's use of plutonium-238 dioxide radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) and radioisotope thermal generators (RHUs) (Rodrigue 2001a, 2001b, 2001c). RTGs are used to power spacecraft instruments for such outer solar system missions as the Cassini- Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan and the Galileo mission to Jupiter. RHUs are used to provide heat to keep spacecraft instruments operating in the deep cold of outer solar system space. RTGs and RHUs generate heat through the alpha radiation given off by the Pu-dioxide as it decays (JPL n.d.). In the case of Cassini-Huygens, NASA's decision to utilize a Venus-Venus- Earth-Jupiter gravitational assist trajectory (VVEJGA) increased the controversy. The gravitational assists increase the speed of the spacecraft and substantially shorten the length of the cruise to Saturn, 1.4 billion km from the sun. They work by bringing a spacecraft close to a planet in the direction of the planet's revolution, in order to allow an exchange of angular momentum between them. In assessing the risks posed by Cassini- Huygens, then, attention focussed on the pre-launch handling of the RTGs and RHUs, mishaps during launch, and accidents during the flyby which could cause the spacecraft to break up and explode in the earth's atmosphere. Risk assessment done for NASA concluded that the risks involved were trivial, with extremely small probabilities of accidents releasing Pu into the earth's atmosphere and minor health effects in the event a worst-case accident did take place. All estimates for any of the pre-launch or launch phases fell below one health effect or surplus cancer death over five decades, with a 1% probability of from 0.55-1.50 surplus deaths being exceeded. For the flyby manoeuvre, final estimates of expected health effects were 120, with a 1% probability of 450 surplus deaths being exceeded (NASA 1997: 2.20-2.23). Opponents claimed that NASA and the media were covering up the extent of the risk. They stated an accident could give every person on Earth lung cancer and directly cause the deaths of anywhere from 200,000 to 40 million people (Kaku 1997; Grossman 1997). Using e-mail, listservers, and newsgroups, as well as web pages and articles and editorials in print media, a handful of people orchestrated a large political opposition movement to pressure Congress and the President to cancel the launch and later the Earth gravity- assist manoeuvre. This movement was ultimately able to attract the attention of broadcast media through demonstrations and other dramatic confrontations. They did not ultimately succeed in either canceling the launch or aborting the Earth flyby, they did succeed in making the use of RTGs and RHUs controversial (Golombek 2001). Internet organizing was able to circumvent the many filters and obstacles normally encountered in trying to publicize a cause through conventional print and broadcast media (see, e.g., Bagdikian 1992; Herman and Chomsky 1988; Lee and Solomon 1991). Internet organizing is able to take advantage of chain-mail mathematics, that is, the propagation of a few people's messages through recipients' forward buttons to an exponentially expanding audience. A literal handful of people was able to reach an audience of a size and spatial scope normally only the purview of major media conglomerates. In its capacity of distributing agenda-setting power more widely through society, the Internet is a democratizing influence; it equally well empowers demogoguery. Risk management policy-makers will be hearing from more people more often and trying to discern the extent of the emotions' and arguments' appeal among their constituencies. I am now following another emerging risk assessment and management controversy related to the space program: The Mars Sample Return Lander. The purpose of this mission is to collect samples of Martian soil and rocks for return to Earth for detailed study of their elemental, isotopic, and minerological composition, as well as evidence of past climates and geomorphological processes they may contain. The samples will be studied for signs of life, past or present. Return to Earth is highly sought, given the ambiguity affecting the robotic tests on the 1976 Viking lander (NAS 1996). This mission, if approved, could have its first launch as early as October of 2011 and return to Earth in September of 2014 (JPL 2002a). More probably, it will launch in 2014 and again in 2016 (JPL 2002b; Savage 2000). This mission has already raised three distinct risk assessment and management controversies . The first of these is similar to the Cassini controversy: The mission will almost certainly involve the use of RTGs, because of the need for absolutely reliable power output for months on Mars. Because of this, it can be expected that the same parties that orchestrated the anti-Cassini movement will begin to organize against the MSRL. At least one group is already keeping an eye on the mission, i.e., the Global Network against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space (no date).<br />

In consideration of all the associated problems with returning Martian soil samples directly to the Earth or by<br />
examination in Earth orbit, a dedicated human tended planetary quarantine laboratory on the Moon as part of a<br />
larger scientific outpost could provide the best solution to the back contamination problem and might inspire the<br />
public to rally around such a worthy scientific cause.<br />
The Moon offers the following advantages for the examination of planetary samples suspected of containing<br />
bioactive materials:<br />
1. The Moon offers a 100% back contamination-free environment.<br />
2. The Moon has gravity and would make working with extraterrestrial soil samples and any putative<br />
microbes they contain less difficult than working in a microgravity environment of an orbital space station<br />
or shuttle module designed for such a task.<br />
3. The lack of a lunar atmosphere and near vacuum conditions greatly reduces the possibility of contamination<br />
to other areas of a potential scientific lunar outpost.<br />
4. Extraterrestrial microorganims in the lunar planetary quarantine laboratory could be tested against a wide<br />
variety of terrestrial ecosystems in enclosed modules or possibly green houses simulating various Earth<br />
environments. This would be done before any samples could be certified for return to laboratories on Earth.<br />
5. Unlimited size of returned samples. Scientific payoff could be much greater. The 1/3 lunar gravity would<br />
permit almost unlimited payloads from Mars or other solar system body.<br />
6. Experiments on the mutation rates of terrestrial microorganisms in the space radiation environment would<br />
advance studies of life on Earth and the potential for life in the universe.<br />
7. Studies involving theories of microbial transfer in space such as panspermia could be conducted routinely.<br />
8. A well planned lunar planetary quarantine laboratory could be perceived by the public and world scientific<br />
community as a legitimate reason to invest in a return to the Moon.<br />

 <strong>Global warming is real and undeniable, isolated incidents of cold spells don’t speak to the trend of climate change</strong><br />
<strong>Jones 10</strong> [Jenny, Administration of Air and Water Resource and Solid Waste Management Programs, “NOAA Offers Extensive Proof of Global Warming”, Civil Engineering (08857024); Sep2010, Vol. 80 Issue 9, p36-36, 1p, Chetan]<br />
<br />
Global warming is undeniable. That’s the message of a report recently released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (noaa) entitled State of the Climate in 2009, which reveals that the world’s average temperature has been steadily increasing in the past three decades, the most recent decade being the hottest ever recorded. The report includes the findings of more than 300 scientists from 48 countries who analyzed data on 37 climate indicators, paying particular attention to 10 markers that they say directly correlate with surface temperature: humidity, air temperature in the lower atmosphere, temperature above the oceans, temperature above land, sea surface temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, sea ice, snow cover, and glaciers. The report documents weather and climate events from around the world in 2009 and offers a historical perspective. In particular, it highlights unusual or anomalous events that happened during the year and throughout the first decade of the 21st century. A transition from La Niña, a condition characterized by temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean lower than normal, to El Niño, which refers to temperatures in the Pacific higher than normal, played a significant role in many extreme and, in some cases, deadly weather events around the globe in 2009. In Brazil, pounding rain in the Amazon basin caused the worst flood in a century, which killed 40 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. Thousands more were left homeless in southeastern South America, which experienced the wettest November in 30 years, and approximately 1,500 properties were damaged in Britain’s Lake District when rain caused record-setting river flows. Southern France and the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula saw a North Atlantic storm with highly powerful winds that knocked down power lines and forced airports and railroads to close, while Australia endured three record-setting heat waves. The high winds accompanying one of those heat waves fanned brush fires that took the lives of more than 170 people. The United States experienced its wettest October in 115 years, and Turkey received the most rainfall in a 48-hour period in 80 years. In the central part of the North Pacific Ocean, including Hawaii, several tropical cyclones struck after more than a decade of relative calm. “Extreme weather events are unavoidable,” the report says. “But a warmer climate means that many of these events will be more frequent and more severe.” And the climate is getting warmer. The average global temperature has been on the rise for the past five decades, but it didn’t reach record levels until the 1980s. Since then, the temperature has risen 1 / 5 of a degree Fahrenheit every decade. While 1 / 5 of a degree from decade to decade may not sound like much, the temperature increase of 1ºF over the past 50 years has been enough to cause glaciers and sea ice to melt, heavy rainfalls to intensify, and heat waves to increase in frequency. “Continued temperature increases will threaten many aspects of our society, including coastal cities and infrastructure, water supply, and agriculture,” the report says. “People have spent thousands of years building [a] society for one climate and now a new [climate] is being created—one that’s warmer and more extreme.” On the basis of preliminary data, 2009 will be the 19th consecutive year in which glaciers have lost mass. The 34 widest glaciers in Greenland that end at the sea lost 101 km² of ice area during the year as a result of below-normal precipitation, and over the decade those glaciers have lost an average of 106 km² of ice area annually. In Alaska, northwestern Canada, Siberia, and northern Europe, permafrost temperatures have shown a general increase in the past several decades. In the Antarctic, evidence reveals that the Antarctic Peninsula is warming at a rate five times that of the global average and that the peninsula experienced significant ice loss in the past decade. Sea ice in the Antarctic was “normal to modestly above normal” for much of 2009, and the austral summer snowmelt throughout the Antarctic was the lowest it has been in 30 years of observation. The limited snowmelt can be attributed to changes in the overlying atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere resulting from stratospheric ozone depletion and greenhouse gas increases. At the other end of the globe, the Arctic’s summer minimum ice extent in 2009 was the lowest recorded since 1979, and the timing of tundra plant “green-up” and senescence showed signs of changing, the high Arctic greening up earlier and the low Arctic staying green well into the fall. “There continued to be widespread evidence of the impact of a general, Arcticwide warming trend in surface air temperatures over land, evident since the mid-1960s,” the report says. As would be expected with a warmer climate, the world’s oceans are heating up. In fact, more than 90 percent of the heat that has led to global warming has gone into the oceans during the past 50 years. While most of this warming has accumulated near the oceans’ surface, warming has been observed as far as 6,000 ft below the surface. The oceans expand as they warm, contributing to the rise in sea level that is also being caused by water from melting glaciers and ice sheets. For the past 15 years, the sea level has risen at a rate of 1 / 8 in. per year. If it continues to rise at this rate, it will pose a serious threat to coastal communities within a few decades. “It’s already affecting some areas, including New Orleans and the surrounding Gulf Coast,” the report says. While the climate is warming, some areas will continue to experience cold spells, but those will occur less frequently and will be less intense. In the winter of 2009–10, for instance, a mass of warm air moved into Canada and pushed the cold air south, resulting in a mild winter in Canada but a frigid and snowy one in the Middle Atlantic states of the United States. “A particular year can [include] record-breaking highs and lows in any given location,” the report says. “But, as a whole, global climate continues to warm, following a 30-year trend.<br />

A recent article about the role of global magnetic fields in the loss of planetary volatiles caught my attention. The article addresses planetary climate issues as they relate to Earth, Mars and Venus, but what struck me was this statement: We don’t have a direct record of the sun’s history, but astronomers can study other stars that are similar to our sun at an earlier age. But in fact, we do have an excellent historical record of the Sun’s history – preserved on our nearby Moon. The Sun constantly emits streams of high-energy particles, consisting mostly of hydrogen atoms and ions (protons). This stream, called the solar wind, has been monitored and studied since satellites were first launched. High-energy solar wind flows around the protective bubble of Earth’s global magnetic field and into interplanetary space. Some of these charged particles become trapped between magnetic lines of force, creating spectacular displays of aurora, known as the “northern lights.” The Moon does not have a global magnetic field, so its surface is directly exposed to the solar wind. These charged particles and neutral atoms impinge directly upon the surface, where some of its atoms are retained on the grains, thus creating a recoverable record of matter from the Sun. The antiquity of the lunar surface means a preserved solar record extending back at least several billion years – the average age of the surface units of the Moon. We have measured solar wind gas implanted onto the dust grains of the Moon using the Apollo samples and have a good indication that this record contains some significant information. One curious and obscure relation in the solar wind record recovered from the Moon suggests that the ratio of some isotopes of nitrogen (specifically, the 15N/14N ratio) has increased over the last couple of billion years. This increase is not predicted in current models of stellar evolution; the current interpretation is that it reflects the addition of a meteoritic component, but changes in the solar output have not been ruled out. So the Sun may be evolving and changing in ways we do not fully understand. The Sun literally is responsible for our existence – without it, life on Earth would not be possible. Media coverage of climate change tends to ignore the critical fact that the primary driver of climate on Earth and all terrestrial planets is the Sun. Before we can understand how and why climate changes on Earth (and it has repeatedly throughout geological history), we must understand what historic role the Sun has played in this complex exchange. At any given time, only the uppermost few millimeters of the Moon’s regolith is exposed to the Sun. Because the regolith is continually excavated, buried, mixed and turned over by the bombardment of meteorites, we have a very complex record to decipher. Such a chaotic, random process would seem poised to destroy exactly the very information we need to access and study, similar to the destruction of scientific clues about past climatic conditions on our geologically dynamic Earth. But our nearest neighbor has provided a process that preserves the solar record in ancient regoliths, whereby the solar record is isolated and sequestered for very long periods of time. The dark maria of the Moon is made up of a myriad of individual lava flows, erupted sporadically but continuously, since 3.9 billion years ago, possibly to as recently as less than 1 billion years ago. These fresh surfaces are readily exposed to the solar wind, which implants its atoms onto the dust grains. From the moment the lava flow cools, this fresh surface is slowly ground up and broken apart by meteorite impact (regolith formation). Then, as new lava flows are extruded, they cover the pre-existing surface regolith, forever sealing it off, along with its preserved solar record, from active surface processes. Thus, thousands of individual lava flows in the maria have buried and preserved millions of ancient regolith deposits, all potentially available for study, allowing us to see not only the output of the current Sun, but the solar wind record of some ancient Sun as well. Thus, the dusty regolith of the Moon acts like a tape recorder, detailing the output of the Sun throughout time. How might we find and access these ancient regoliths and read the preserved solar record? These deposits are accessible wherever there is an exposed section of bedrock in the lunar maria. On the Moon, such exposure occurs within the walls of craters, sinuous rilles and other structural depressions. Not only did we photograph such exposures during the Apollo missions, we may already have sampled a “fossil regolith” from a unit that is more than 3.84 billion years old. Finding and sampling more of these buried units will allow us to reconstruct the output and history of the Sun over the course of at least the last 4 billion years. Here is yet another reason to return to the Moon: to understand the history of our Sun, the primary driver of climate and life on Earth. It is ironic that many people who are most ardent in their concern about Earth’s changing climate disparage lunar return because “we’ve been there.” By dismissing the Moon, they are missing one of the most important chapters necessary in understanding the grand story of the past, present and probable future of the Earth and the Solar System. That chapter – holding vital answers necessary for an informed debate about our constantly changing climate – patiently waits for us on the Moon.<br />

<strong>AND – the Moon is the perfect laboratory for isolating the solar effect on terrestrial warming – predicting future climate change necessitiates an understanding of solar radiation</strong><br />
<strong>Huang and Pollack 10</strong> [Shaopeng and Henry N. - Department of Geological Sciences, University of Michigan, “The Moon - A Witness to the Anthropogenic Effect of Global Warming on Earth”, July 23rd, 2010, <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.geo.lsa.umich.edu/~shaopeng/msgc01-poster.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.geo.lsa.umich.edu/~shaopeng/msgc01-poster.pdf</a></span>, Chetan]<br />
<br />
It is widely believed that the recent global warming is driven by both natural forcing such as fluctuation in solar radiation and anthropogenic forcing such as the increase of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to industrialization. Of fundamental importance to our ability to predict future climate change is to separate the contributions of these two factors. However, the difficulty in separating the two lies in the fact that there is no direct way of isolating their climate impacts based on observations on Earth. Supported in part by the Michigan Space Grant Consortium, we investigate the feasibility of isolating solar effect of global warming on Earth via reconstruction of a lunar surface temperature history based on regolith temperatures. Between 1880 and 1999 the global-mean temperature at the surface of Earth warmed by more than 0.5 ºC (Jones et al., Rev. Geophys. 1999, 37:173-199). During the same period, the amount of carbon dioxide measured in Earth's atmosphere increased by about 30 percent, as a consequence of our ever- increasing use of fossil fuels and deforestation (Crowley, Science 2000, 298: 270-277). Meanwhile, solar activity has exhibited an increasing trend, along with an 11-year periodical fluctuation (Lean, Res. Lett. 2000, 27: 2425-2428). Apparently, both greenhouse gases and solar activity have effects on Earth's climate. Shown in the diagram above are normalized data series of global temperature anomaly, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and solar irradiance over the period from 1880 to 1998. Each data series is normalized by its own range (temperature anomaly: –0.595 to +0.638 K, carbon dioxide concentration: 267 to 384 ppm, solar irradiance: 1364.4354 to 1366.735 W m-2 ) over the period. The Moon is an ideal laboratory to focus on the solar radiation. There is no complication of human activities in the climate system of the Moon. Temperature at the Moon’s surface is determined by the radiation it receives from the Sun. As the nearby satellite of Earth, the change of the mean temperature on the Moon’s surface is a faithful reflection of the solar radiation imposed on Earth’s climate system. However, there is no meteorological record of the Moon that can be compared to that of Earth. Our understanding of temperature change of our own planet prior to the existence of direct instrumental records relies on temperature proxies such as tree-rings, pollen, corals, isotopic ratios of atmosphere as preserved in ice cores or sediments, and borehole temperatures. Because of the absence of life and atmosphere, all the conventional proxies, except subsurface temperatures, do not exist on the Moon. Subsurface temperature is the only known index that can be used for a reconstruction of a temperature history on the Moon; subsurface temperature is an archive of climate change. Temperatures beneath the surface of the Moon, as well as Earth, comprise two principal components: a steady-state component related to the flow of heat outward from its deeper interior, and a downward-propagating transient component related to the perturbations from changes at the ground surface. If the surface temperature is steady, the subsurface temperature (T) is a linear function of depth (D). However, if the surface temperature is not steady but changes with time, the subsurface temperature will depart from the linear distribution. A progressive cooling at the surface will increase the temperature gradient at shallow depth, while a progressive warming will result in a lesser gradient or even a negative gradient at shallow depths. If the surface temperature oscillates with time, oscillations in the subsurface temperature profile will follow. The change of surface temperature in the past is, therefore, recorded as the current distribution of subsurface temperature versus depth.<br />

<strong>Second, a climate observatory on the Moon gives us the observation angle to compare solar and terrestrial radiation</strong><br />
<strong>Huang 8</strong> [Shaopeng - Department of Geological Sciences, University of Michigan, “Surface temperatures at the nearside of the Moon as a record of the radiation budget of Earth’s climate system”, Advances in Space Research Volume 41, Issue 11, 2008, Pages 1853-1860, Chetan]<br />
<br />
Understanding the balance between incoming energy from the Sun and outgoing energy from Earth is of fundamental importance to our ability to predict future climate. Ground-based observation of this radiation budget is obstructed by the atmosphere. Over the past three decades, several satellite missions have been launched for obtaining measurements from space. Satellite data have improved our understanding of the climate system of Earth. However, the interpretation of the satellite measurements is difficult and sometimes controversial due to the lack of long term continuous monitoring from a stable platform. As the sole natural satellite of Earth, the Moon is an enduring platform without complications from atmosphere, hydrosphere, or biosphere. Because the Moon keeps the same hemisphere towards Earth, solar radiation and terrestrial radiation are naturally separated during daytime and nighttime on the nearside of the Moon. The distance from Earth and the synchronic rotation make it possible for an observatory on the nearside of the Moon to have a disk-wide observation angle and a focus on the sunlit side radiation of Earth. Therefore, lunar records of the radiation budget of Earth are complementary to ground-based and man-made satellite records. The accidentally obtained Apollo 15 lunar surface temperature time series reveal distinct characteristics in the lunar daytime and nighttime surface temperatures. Superimposed on the diurnal and seasonal variations was an inter-annual daytime cooling trend over the observation period. In contrast, there was an upward trend in the lunar nighttime temperature which supposedly is controlled by the radiation from Earth. Although the data analysis of this study is preliminary, both the simple radiation model calculation and the long-term lunar surface temperature time series from the Apollo 15 landing site show that signals of the radiation budget of the Earth’s climate system is detectable on the Moon. Global climate change on Earth is among the most profound scientific, social, economical, and political challenges of our time. This study shows that the Moon is a plausible platform for monitoring the terrestrial climate system, and lunar surface temperature data comprise information on the radiation budget of Earth. The author calls for international effort to develop a network of temperature and radiation observatories on the Moon for the study of terrestrial climate change.<br />

<strong>These views of the Earth are critical to useful climate models</strong><br />

<br />
Critical differences exist between scientists who observe weather and climate and those who attempt to model nature’s complexities. Those who observe the natural, economic, and sociological aspects of climate change see no evidence indicating that human activities have influenced global climate. Actual observations show that climate varies in response to natural forces and that human burning of fossil fuels has had negligible if any effect over the last 100 years. The modelers, on the other hand, believe complex mathematics and broad assumptions can forecast the future of climate, Earth’s most complex system. Models do not yet match observations; however, continuous space-based observation, including, stable, integrating, whole globe views from the Moon, can provide the basis for ultimate creation of useful global climate models. These observations more immediately can provide data for near term anticipation of actions necessary to mitigate the effects of climate change, whether warming or cooling.<br />

<br />
The bill was defeated after 48 senators voted in favour and 36 against, leaving the bill 12 votes short of the 60 required to ensure it progressed. A further six Senators wrote letters indicating they would have voted in favour, had they been available. Despite the defeat, supporters of the legislation hailed the move as a huge step forward in attempts to curb US emissions. Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer, who helped shepherd the bill, said that the vote underlined changing US attitudes to global warming, noting that when climate change legislation was last voted on in 2005 it got only 38 votes. She added that supporters of the bill would now begin work on a &quot;roadmap&quot; for the next president that could see an amended version of the legislation adopted as early as next year. Under the legislation, carbon emissions from 87 per cent of US power stations, oil refineries and other carbon intensive operations would have been included in a cap-and-trade scheme designed to cut US emissions by around 67 per cent by 2050. Critics of the bill, including President Bush who said he would veto the legislation, argued that it would damage the US economy. But supporters of the bill, including the Ceres coalition institutional investors and a group of leading US energy firms, claimed the package of measures would help create jobs and provide the legislative framework for building a low carbon economy. Environmentalists hailed the vote as a &quot;turning point&quot; in the US debate on global warming. Lexi Shultz, deputy director of the Climate Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the bill had gained such momentum that legislation capping emissions was now &quot; inevitable&quot;. &quot;More senators than ever before supported moving forward on climate solutions, including senators who voiced opposition to global warming bills in the past,&quot; she said. &quot;Americans are demanding global warming solutions. It's a shame they will have to wait another year. But our country will have another global warming debate in 2009 with a new Congress and president. Putting a cap on global warming pollution is inevitable.&quot;<br />

<strong>However, an incomplete understanding of warming, lack of assessment data and accurate models are hurting its chances</strong><br />

<br />
Climate change is a global problem. A global response is necessary, using existing or new vehicles for cooperation. While there is broad consensus that national interests are threatened by climate change, turning this consensus into meaningful action will be difficult. Negotiation takes place in the context of competing national economic interests. The countries most vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate, mostly developing countries, do not have the capacity to cope with these changes and look to developed countries for assistance. Our understanding of how to mitigate and adapt to climate change is still at an early stage. Remedies have been identified, but their effectiveness has yet to be measured. Finally, the data necessary for assessing the effect of these efforts and the mechanisms for sharing that data are partial and incomplete, designed to inform science and not policy. There is still a great deal we do not know about the local and global effects of climate change. Several recent studies identified gaps and weaknesses in climate science activities. One of the main conclusions of this research is that climate science to date has been geared toward fulfilling needs within the scientific community rather than meeting the needs of decisionmakers who must determine how to adapt and respond to a changing climate. Managing climate-related risks requires accurate, robust, sustained, and wide-ranging climate information. Sustained and continuous observations are needed for researchers to evaluate and test climate model accuracy and to identify causes of particular elements of climate change. The international community must address four key uncertainties and gaps in climate research if we are to significantly improve our confidence in climate change prediction and understanding: Incomplete global data sets for analysis and modeling uncertainties restrict the types of studies that can be performed. ■ The lack of observational data restricts the types of climate change that can be analyzed. ■ Multi-decadal changes in daily temperature range are not well understood. ■ Confidence in attributing some climate change phenomena to anthropogenic (man-made) influences is limited. These gaps and uncertainties are directly related to the availability of adequate Earth observations. Earth observation provides the evidence necessary for informed decisionmaking. It supports the monitoring and verification of emission reductions. A comprehensive and global perspective in climate monitoring is needed to understand the interconnectivity of Earth’s terrestrial, atmospheric, and oceanic systems. Understanding the climate problem requires accurate, robust, sustained, and wide-ranging climate information. Masses of data are already collected for atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial phenomena. 3 These data are shared among the research community through various international data centers, but the informational needs of policymakers are different from those of researchers. The primary requirements for policy are timely and consistent access to data for assessing actions and reducing uncertainty. The data (and improved models to use that data) that policymakers will need fall into several categories: ■ Trend data that track the shrinking of the polar ice caps or forests, the presence of gases in the upper environment, or changes in ocean temperature or currents. Depending on the adequacy of predictive models, these data would allow assessment of the rate and nature of climate change. ■ Regional data that enable the identification of specific regional problems to allow for tailored solutions or aid programs. The need for cross border collection complicates the gathering of these regional data. ■ Effects assessment data that would reduce uncertainty and allow policymakers to determine whether mitigation or adaptation policies implemented to address climate change are having any effect. ■ Compliance data to monitor progress in support of an agreement. One of the lessons of the recent climate negotiations in Copenhagen is that ensuring compliance with any future agreement to limit emissions will be politically sensitive for some countries and beyond the technical or financial means of many others. ■ Planning data that provide consistent and timely information that insurance companies, farmers, urban planners, major corporations, and others will need to reduce uncertainty. These data would allow local planners, governments, businesses, and private sector consumers like the insurance industry to assess the likelihood of certain impacts and conduct cost-benefit analysis of different response options (see appendix A for a more detailed discussion of such options). On the international level, this type of regional information is necessary for determining which areas of the world will be most affected and should receive a higher priority for aid, financing, technology, and capacity building. Monitoring and verifying of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is of particular importance. Reaching an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is complicated because of the inherent scientific uncertainty and incomplete understanding of the carbon cycle and warming of the Earth. Recent scientific advancements, however, allow us to conclude with a high level of certainty that climate change and global warming are unequivocal and that the primary driver is carbon dioxide produced by burning of fossil fuels and, to a lesser degree, by deforestation; Currently, identifying trends in GHG emissions relies on weaving together data collected from existing ground-based networks and space-borne instruments, using a process called “trace-transport inversion.” As the United States and other nations consider whether to adopt cap-and-trade policies, they will need a coordinated and efficient system for collecting and distributing data to support carbon markets and to promote transparency and accountability through accessible public information. Better climate information has helped us move beyond the question of whether action to manage climate change is warranted to what types of actions and polices are needed. Information is key to an effective approach to climate change. At a national and international level, many countries are preoccupied with how to ensure that decisionmakers and user communities have access to the types of information that will make the climate efforts successful. This includes coordinated systems for Earth observation, enhanced modeling capabilities, an organizational structure that allows science to be more responsive to relevant policy questions or functions, and places where information can be gathered and made accessible to broad-based user communities. Meeting the needs of climate policy requires a transformation in how climate research is incorporated into public policymaking. 4 “Operationalizing” information systems—investing in the Earth observation systems necessary for producing the right data over the right time and space horizons, coordinating data collection, interpreting and sharing to maximize the data’s benefits, focusing on the human and social science effects of climate change, improving modeling capabilities, and making this information accessible and relevant for a wide range of users—is a necessary step in designing effective U.S. climate policy. It also represents an opportunity for America to demonstrate global leadership and contribute to building global capacity to understand and more effectively respond to the climate<br />
<br />
<strong>Cap and trade is by and large the most effective way to cap emissions and solve warming</strong><br />
<strong>Pew 9</strong> [The Pew Center on Global Climate Change is a non-profit, non-partisan, independent organization dedicated to providing credible information, straight answers, and innovative solutions in the effort to address global climate change. “Climate Change 101 Cap and Trade”, January 2009, <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pewclimate.org/docUploads/Climate101-CapTrade-Jan09.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pewclimate.org/docUploads/Climate101-CapTrade-Jan09.pdf</a></span>, Chetan]<br />
<br />
Cap-and-trade programs offer significant advantages over traditional regulatory policies, particularly in the effort to address climate change. Unlike traditional regulation, cap and trade constrains emissions but lets market forces set a price on greenhouse gas emissions and helps minimize the cost of making substantial reductions in those emissions. Rather than mandating a specific technology, the flexibility afforded by emissions trading markets helps identify where emission reductions can be achieved most cost-effectively. Cap and trade stimulates the development of new technological solutions that can enable much deeper cuts at lower cost in the future—technologies that regulators simply cannot anticipate. Furthermore, emissions trading programs can be designed to cover a wide variety of emissions sources and sectors and serve as the core of an economy-wide GHG reduction program.<br />

Slowly, painfully, we are developing a new policy framework that we hope will enable our society to cope with a changing climate. But currently we do not have in place the necessary “knowledge infrastructure” to make this new system work. As we develop new policies, we are confronted with critical questions of capacity and responsibility for this endeavor. The scientific community has done a great deal to study the nature and pace of global climate change and increase our understanding of these global phenomena—both in terms of what we know and what we do not know. Now, as policymakers, businesses, the international community, and households consider ways to reduce emissions in the hope of avoiding the most severe effects of a changing climate, build more resilient infrastructure and systems to withstand the unavoidable impacts of climate change, and plan for dealing with climate-related disasters, our ability to provide decisionmakers with the information that they need must grow and improve. Among many complex issues, we need to understand climate-related trends as they apply to state and local communities; we must decide how to monitor emissions and check results against agreed-upon reductions and expected outcomes; we must address how to better model the economic effects of emissions reductions plans and a changing natural environment in ways that will help us understand the impact of new climate policies. We need to establish methods of assessing the relative costs and benefits of more aggressive action that will allow us to prioritize actions to take for climate change, and, of course, we need to continuously improve on understanding how and why the Earth’s climate is changing so as to build greater certainty into policy efforts. This is a daunting task for government, which must manage information on an unprecedented scale. Federal agencies will have to translate vast quantities of scientific data into knowledge that can guide policymakers and administrators. Currently, the federal government is generating enormous amounts of data and analysis on the Earth’s climate, on ocean temperatures and currents, on jet streams and Arctic ice melt. Over time, our ability to monitor emissions and understand important feedbacks, including societal adjustments to the policies in place as well as a changing climate, will need to improve and expand. The government does have an excellent starting point with the work of the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Earth observation functions supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NOAA has made tremendous efforts, working with foreign partners to create the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS). This network seeks to provide global, real-time data in an open, collaborative, and transparent way. But the implementation of GEOSS has not progressed much beyond developing a blueprint for the system.1 To establish a new policy framework for addressing these challenges, the federal government must ask and answer the question: Where do we attain knowledge, process it, and make policy on such an enormous scale? The United States has the opportunity to build the knowledge platform we will need to help inform the hard decisions that lie ahead. The 2008 CSIS report, CSIS Commission on Smart Power: A Smarter, More Secure America, called for the United States to find ways for “investing in the global good.” The report highlighted five critical areas for engagement, including technology and innovation. It singled out climate change as an issue that required American leadership to help establish global consensus and develop innovative solutions to manage a new and complex global challenge. Climate change is a global challenge, but it is also an opportunity for the United States to build its global leadership. Now is the time for the current administration to build up the knowledge infrastructure for climate change. It will clearly take a team effort to coordinate resources, streamline decisionmaking, and disseminate information, perhaps as part of a new National Climate Service, to start now to build this critical knowledge infrastructure. Without the knowledge this infrastructure would establish and a realistic process to manage it, we will be sailing in uncharted waters with rumored and uncertain landmarks.<br />

<strong>Warming is the most likely scenario for extinction</strong><br />

Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as prosperity) of a nonviolent nature, which, though far in the future, demands urgent action. It is the threat of global warming to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. Scientists worldwide have been observing the gathering of this threat for three decades now, and what was once a mere possibility has passed through probability to near certainty. Indeed not one of more than 900 articles on climate change published in refereed scientific journals from 1993 to 2003 doubted that anthropogenic warming is occurring. “In legitimate scientific circles,” writes Elizabeth Kolbert, “it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fundamentals of global warming.” Evidence from a vast international scientific monitoring effort accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: an international panel predicts “brutal droughts, floods and violent storms across the planet over the next century”; climate change could “literally alter ocean currents, wipe away huge portions of Alpine Snowcaps and aid the spread of cholera and malaria”; “glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and…worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than a decade ago”; “rising sea temperatures have been accompanied by a significant global increase in the most destructive hurricanes”; “NASA scientists have concluded from direct temperature measurements that 2005 was the hottest year on record, with 1998 a close second”; “Earth’s warming climate is estimated to contribute to more than 150,000 deaths and 5 million illnesses each year” as disease spreads; “widespread bleaching from Texas to Trinidad…killed broad swaths of corals” due to a 2-degree rise in sea temperatures. “The world is slowly disintegrating,” concluded Inuit hunter Noah Metuq, who lives 30 miles from the Arctic Circle. “They call it climate change…but we just call it breaking up.” From the founding of the first cities some 6,000 years ago until the beginning of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere remained relatively constant at about 280 parts per million (ppm). At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how serous the effects will be. As the newspaper stories quoted above show, we are already experiencing the effects of 1-2 degree warming in more violent storms, spread of disease, mass die offs of plants and animals, species extinction, and threatened inundation of low-lying countries like the Pacific nation of Kiribati and the Netherlands at a warming of 5 degrees or less the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida, and inundate Manhattan up to the middle of Greenwich Village. Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation that keeps the winter weather in Europe far warmer than its latitude would otherwise allow. Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system. At worst, says physics professor Marty Hoffert of New York University, “we’re just going to burn everything up; we’re going to heat the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, and then everything will collapse.” During the Cold War, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the Untied States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possibly end life on this planet. Global warming is the post-Cold War era’s equivalent of nuclear winter at least as serious and considerably better supported scientifically. Over the long run it puts dangers form terrorism and traditional military challenges to shame. It is a threat not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet.<br />

DIRECT architecture advantages The DIRECT Advanced Upper Stage (AUS) will use a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne J-2X vacuum-optimized engines for the ascent and Earth departure phases of the mission. In the DIRECT the AUS will be launched first and may have to orbit for extended durations until the crew rendezvous, an architecture design requiring the use of an Integrated Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ICES) EDS, combined with an active cooling system to reduce boil-off to 0.01 % per day. The AUS, once the crew have completed the rendezvous, will serve as the EDS and represents the stage enabling the DIRECT architecture to match the ESAS design. The DIRECT fulfills the ESAS recommendations of utilizing two launches to place all lunar mission components in orbit but, whereas the ESAS requires one small Ares I for crew and one large Ares V for cargo, the DIRECT uses one reconfigurable vehicle, an approach solving many development problems. For example, building two different LVs requires two separate development programs, two operations support programs, and two manufacturing infrastructures, but with the DIRECT approach- utilizing existing Shuttle hardware and infrastructure, there are no such requirements, thereby saving money and time. Mission timetable Because DIRECT utilizes so much existing hardware and requires so little development of new systems, it will be able to commence the first crewed flights of Orion as early as 2012, and manned lunar exploration as soon as 2017, more than three years ahead of NASA's current architecture. This timeline significantly closes the gap between the retirement of the Space Shuttle, planned for 2010, and NASA's first manned flight of Orion which has now slipped to at least September 2015 and may slip still further to April 2016. However, this is not the whole story as it is likely architecture. This will result in the first Ares I Orion flight being even further delayed.<br />

 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">I am a woman and I am a debater, and I would like to think that there is a place in this community for me, where I can speak my views passionately, without the worry that somebody is going to tell me to be a lady. I believe this community can break free of the double bind that many women find themselves in, that gets them labeled a bitch time and time again. Because if I debate like a “man” and refuse to back down, and express my views loud and proud, then I’m told that I’m too aggressive, but if the way I express it is with a soft voice that sounds all submissive, then I’m weak and every time I get cross-x’ed I look like I get beat, and I like I don’t understand the words I speak. I believe that I deserve the right to be a full fledged member of a community that claims to value education and equality, because I believe that we can find room for women like me.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">I’ll say it again. I am a woman, and I am a debater, so when a team sees my partner and I here, and call us guys, we reserve the right to check the round for another team, because they surely aren’t referring to us. Even though they don’t mean to offend, the point is, that in this community that’s what normal is. Men. But don’t get us wrong. We want people to stop assuming that we are boys, but at the same time to stop obsessing when they realize we are girls. We aren’t the JCHS girls. We are the JCHS debaters, and there is a world of difference between the two.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">We are women in debate, and we’ve done the extinction thing before, and we’ve played out talking about nuclear war, and we’re up for a change. Instead we want arguments that can make our lives different, so we decided to run an aff with a gender spin. Wait for the backlash cause here it comes again. Cause now we’re “that” fem team, doing the whole “girl thing”, and who the hell wants to hit them, cause who the hell wants to talk fem? And “You’re trying to solve patriarchy again?” No. We are trying to expose the norms that make us conform and be feminine, that push women out of debate time and time again. We are trying to bring norms into the light, to show that a gender is not a birthright, that these social constructions make certain lives impossible to live, and its time to bring the girl/boy thing to an end.</span><br />

 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">This double standard is not exclusive to debate, this can be seen through the story of the mercury 13 who were prevented from going to space because of what was between their legs, which meant that they weren’t supposed to want to fly to space, and their desire to fly to space made them no longer recognizable as women but merely as recreational equipment</span><br />

The masculine self-identity of pilots has often been understood through an eroticized desire for risk and suffering, or what Law (2002) terms ‘Thrills and spills’ (p. 32). Similarly, McCurdy (1993), quotes one Apollo astronaut as saying, ‘Recognition of risk is what made us as good as we were’ (p. 62), while another states ‘But if it [risk of death] was like, one in one hundred, you would do it, you take it ... There were so many ways it could happen’ (p. 63). Across such statements <span style="text-decoration: none;">astronauts’ fetishized tolerance of risk as a part of the performance of manliness; risk became part of the astronauts’ identity</span>, contributing to what Tom Wolfe's novel (1979) famously referred to as ‘The Right Stuff’. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Yet this attitude towards physical and mental subjugation was not mere blind masochism; it was, also predicated upon a set of techniques concerned with the control of bodies</span> wherein the astronauts were rigorously tested to confirm a high degree of corporeal control and calculation over their own bodies and perform tasks in this hostile environment – to maintain control in a situation despite the discomfort and vulnerability and get the job done. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Within all these images of the astronaut there exist mutually shaping essentializing associations between masculinity, corporeality, outer space, risk and high-technology that prefigure the identity</span> construction of ‘The Right Stuff’; becoming increasingly evident when challenged with transgressive Other(s), namely female bodies.6 <span style="text-decoration: none;">Such an instance occurred in 1962, when a small group of women successfully passed the</span> some of <span style="text-decoration: none;">same physical and psychological tests as the Mercury astronauts</span>, in a privately funded women astronaut study organized by a physiologist called Dr. William Lovelace (see Shayler and Moule, 2003; Weitekamp, 2004). The women now sought NASA's support to become astronauts. ‘Lovelace's Women in Space Project’ (Weitekamp, 2004) or ‘<span style="text-decoration: none;">The Mercury 13’</span> (Ackmann, 2004) <span style="text-decoration: none;">de-stabilized many of the iterative bodily performances enacted through NASA that prescribed binary gendered assumptions.</span>7 <span style="text-decoration: none;">The desire of these women to become astronauts and their embodied suitability, transgressed the tacitly masculinist spatio-temporal categorization of different bodies under modernity</span> (Massey, 2005: 93). <span style="text-decoration: none;">These bodies offered</span>, in Judith Butler's (1990) terms<span style="text-decoration: none;">, a sense of hope ‘in the possibility of a failure to repeat, a de-formity, or a parodic repetition that exposes the phantasmatic effect of abiding identity as a politically tenuous construction’</span> (p. 192). Just as some homosexual bodily performances may present a particular body in an opposing gender role (see Butler, 1990: 167–170), <span style="text-decoration: none;">thus exposing the de-stabilized ‘ground’ of</span> both<span style="text-decoration: none;">gendered identities</span>, these astronauts tacitly desired to place a female body in a hegemonically masculine guise. Yet equally, as Butler (1990) makes clear, such transgressions, while sometimes transformative, are frequently accompanied by ‘punishments that attend not agreeing to believe in them’ (p. 190). For example<span style="text-decoration: none;">, in 1962 Dr. Lovelace sought the Navy's permission to expand his use of their facilities to provide further evidence of the women's suitability. The official reply to the Navy was that ‘NASA does not at this time have a requirement for such a program’</span> (Weitekamp, 2004: 128). This reply was then made known to Dr. Lovelace and the women involved; it effectively cancelled the nascent woman into space project. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Here</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the twin spectres of technological determinism and instrumentalism</span> (Feenberg, 1999<span style="text-decoration: none;">) are used to conjure up a belief in value-neutral, automatic and unilateral technical decision-making. In turn, this meant that the space programme could be constructed as if it were an inevitable temporal sequence, expressing natural gender roles and bodily practices, and devoid of ethno-political import</span> (Shayler and Moule, 2003). The decision was re-examined in a heated Congressional hearing in July 1962, in which the Lovelace Women, led by Geraldine ‘Jerrie’ Cobb, were cross-examined by Congressmen partly in an attempt to illustrate their technical worth objectively, above and beyond their male peers (Shayler and Moule, 2003, p. 149). <span style="text-decoration: none;">The women demonstrated the capacity of their bodies to pass the same flight-tests as men, as well as possessing some important advantages</span>, not least their requirements for less food and oxygen – on account of their smaller size (Penley, 1997: 55). <span style="text-decoration: none;">Ultimately, however, the women's transgressive bodily desires were blocked through quasi-judicial significations of risk. Namely, a belief asserted by NASA that astronauts had to be jet test pilots, a profession women were already barred from</span>, because only jet test pilots possessed the necessary experience to undertake high-risk flight experiments<span style="text-decoration: none;">. This point appeared already undermined by NASA's own demonstration that spacecraft could fly automatically in outer space</span> (Penley, 1997), combined with the rejection of many skilled test pilots by the astronaut selectors, such as Chuck Yeager. NASA's Chief of Manned Space Flight, George Low, then explained to Congress how NASA support for the women-in-space project would set his work back, despite the fact that Lovelace had requested the very limited use of Navy not NASA facilities (Ackmann, 2004: 166). More implicitly<span style="text-decoration: none;">, it appears the decision revolved around a belief that women were excluded from becoming jet test pilots (or astronauts) because it was deemed too risky</span> (Weitekamp, 2004: 149). In this case<span style="text-decoration: none;">, a masculinized relationship between technology and risk within American modernity proved intractable; accordingly men were able to dictate thresholds of female risk</span>. As Weitekamp (2004) explains, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the male construction of female risk prevalent in NASA was two-fold</span>: on the one hand<span style="text-decoration: none;">, NASA seemed reluctant to subject women to degrees of risk because ‘the prospect of subjecting a woman to mortal danger betrayed the rigidly defined gendered roles asserted in post-war America’</span> (p. 3). On the other hand, <span style="text-decoration: none;">this paternalist designation of women as needing protecting might itself lead the public to conclude that if women flew in spacecraft then the craft themselves might be deemed too straightforward and safe</span>. Thus as Weitekamp (2004) puts it<span style="text-decoration: none;">, if ‘a woman could perform those tasks [it] would diminish their prestige’</span> (p. 3). <span style="text-decoration: none;">The appropriation within NASA of risk as the legitimate means by which to exclude women from outer space appears only strengthened through its seemingly contradictory blending of different masculine identities</span>. In this case<span style="text-decoration: none;">, risk is alternately, and seemingly paradoxically, constructed as both a cipher for the rational management of hazards and the manly celebration of danger.</span> Here <span style="text-decoration: none;">the capacity to render masculinity fractionally coherent</span> (Law, 2002<span style="text-decoration: none;">) renders it more, not less, persistent in justifying patriarchal norms.</span> The Mercury astronaut <span style="text-decoration: none;">John Glenn</span>, who had just returned back to Earth to a ticker-tape parade after being the first American to orbit the Earth, <span style="text-decoration: none;">summarized his verdict in a final statement within the hearing: I think this gets back to the way our social order is organized really. It is just a fact. The men go off and fight the wars and fly airplanes and come back and help design and build and test them. The fact that women are not in this field is a fact of our social order. It may be undesirable</span> (quoted in Weitekamp, 2004: 151). While <span style="text-decoration: none;">Glenn</span>'s reference to ‘undesirable’ may be telling of shifting attitudes towards women, he nevertheless <span style="text-decoration: none;">asserts that there is something inherently masculine about these interactions between bodies, risk and technology, so that only particular bodies were deemed not just more desirable but almost factually suitable</span>. After the hearing, <span style="text-decoration: none;">female astronauts were frequently the subject of further derision, often evoking the ‘heterosexual matrix’ of submissive female sexuality</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">as Wernher von Braun demonstrated in a speech</span> given at Mississippi State College (19 Nov. 1962): Well, <span style="text-decoration: none;">all I can say is that the male astronauts are all for it.</span> And as my best friend Bob Gilruth [director of Johnston Space Center of manned spaceflight] says, <span style="text-decoration: none;">we're reserving 110 pounds of payload for recreational equipment</span> (from Parade Magazine Sunday Supplement, December 1962 – quoted in Kevles, 2003: 4).<br />

These ideas continue to pervade status quo US space discourse, which in turn reproduces outer space as a heterosexualized masculinzed realm.<br />

This chapter is about sex, but not the sex that people already have clarity about. 'Outer <span style="text-decoration: none;">space' as a human, political domain is organized around sex, but a 'sex' that is tacitly located, and rarely spoken</span>, in official discourse. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The politics of outer space exploration, militarization and commercialization</span> as they are conceived of and practiced in the US, <span style="text-decoration: none;">embody a distinction between public and private</span> (and appropriate behaviours, meanings and identities therein) highly <span style="text-decoration: none;">dependent upon heteronormative hierarchies of property and propriety</span>.1 The central aim of this chapter is to show how <span style="text-decoration: none;">US outer space discourse, an imperial discourse of technological, military and commercial superiority, configures and prescribes success and successful behaviour in the politics of outer space in particularly gendered forms</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">US space discourse is</span>, I argue, <span style="text-decoration: none;">predicated on a heteronormative discourse of conquest that reproduces the dominance of heterosexual masculinity(ies), and</span> which hierarchically <span style="text-decoration: none;">orders the construction of other (subordinate) gender identities.</span> Reading the politics of outer space as heteronormative suggests that <span style="text-decoration: none;">the discourses through which space exists consist of institutions, structures of understanding, practical orientations and regulatory practices organized and privileged around heterosexuality</span>. As a particularly dominant discursive arrangement of outer space politics<span style="text-decoration: none;">, US space discourse (re)produces meaning through gendered assumptions of exploration, colonization, economic endeavour and military conquest that are deeply gendered whilst presented as universal and neutral. US space discourse, which dominates the contemporary global politics of outer space, is</span> thus <span style="text-decoration: none;">formed from and upon institutions, structures of understanding, and practical orientations that privilege and normalize heterosexuality as universal. </span>As such, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the hegemonic discursive rationalizations of space exploration and conquest (re)produce both heterosexuality as 'unmarked'</span> (that is, thoroughly normalized) <span style="text-decoration: none;">and the heterosexual imperatives that constitute suitable space-able people, practices and behaviours.</span> As the introduction to this volume highlights, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the exploration and utilization of outer space can thus far be held up as a mirror of, rather than a challenge to, existent, terrestrially-bound, political patterns, behaviours and impulses</span>. The new possibilities for human progress that the application and development of space technologies dares us to make are grounded only in the strategyobsessed (be it commercially, militarily or otherwise) realities of contemporary global politics. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Outer space is a conceptual, political and material space, a place for collisions and collusions</span> (literally and metaphorically) <span style="text-decoration: none;">between objects, ideas, identities and discourses</span>. Outer space, like international relations, is a global space always socially and locally embedded<span style="text-decoration: none;">. There is nothing 'out there' about outer space. It exists because of us, not in spite of us, and it is this that means that it only makes sense in social terms, that is, in relation to our own constructions of identity and social location.</span> In this chapter, <span style="text-decoration: none;">outer space is</span> the problematic to which I apply a gender analysis<span style="text-decoration: none;">; an arena wherein past, current and future policy-making is embedded in relation to certain performances of power and reconfigurations of identity that are always, and not incidentally, gendered. Effective and appropriate behaviour in the politics of outer space is configured and prescribed in particularly gendered forms, with heteronormative gender regulations endowing outer space's hierarchies of technologically superior, conquesting performance with their everyday power</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">It is through gender that US techno-strategic and astro-political discourse has been able to (re)produce outer space as a heterosexualized, masculinized realm. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">It is this space discourse that causes male bodies to be viewed as the norm against which female bodies are judged and sets up a heteronormative system of norms in order to conquer for the good of everyone</span><br />

Humans, suggests Crawford, 'bring speed, agility, versatility and intelligence to exploration in a way that robots cannot', justifying to many the employment of astronauts as 'field scientists' on other planets (Crawford 2005: 252). The consistent discursive articulation of outer space as a frontier, a 'threshold' for human intervention requiring the utmost in human performance, depends on a regulatory framework wherein 'humanity' is able consistently and without obstacle (material, psychological or otherwise) to seize the challenge of exploiting and controlling its natural environment and resources. Rarely conceived of purely in technological, aphysical terms, <span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Space is a politics (in US discourse) entirely constituted in reference to the corporeal attributes of the (neo-liberally) human. Within the heteronormative, heterosexual, regulatory framework of US outer space discourse, the ideal, space-able, individual is constructed and reproduced within an unspoken but unequivocal heteronormative framework of reproductive sexuality, as a model that others should approximate: a person, evolved of heterosexual binaries, who is reactive but calm, reproductive but sexually restrained, agile but not hyperactive, versatile but not sexually ambiguous, rational but not mechanical, adventurous but competent (</span>see, e.g. Seguin 2005). <span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Located within a 'masculine context', such a framework has only solidified the sense of male bodies existing as the norm against which female bodies are evaluated, and male physiology the standard by which female bodies are judged</span> (Casper and Moore 1995: 316-319). <span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">This regulatory masculinism has undoubtedly resulted in the overwhelming dominance of male astronauts in space. Although the first American female went into space in 1983, in 2001 of an active astronaut corps of 158, only thirty-five were women</span> (NASA 2001), <span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">and of the 2004 class of astronauts, only two of eleven were female</span> (NASA 2004). But the predominance of male astronauts also stems from the gendered nature of space discourse itself. The quest to conquer space that began with the Cold War 'space race' has long been coded (heterosexually) masculine, dependent on an articulation of masculine prowess realized through gendered assumptions of physical and technical expertise, strength, endurance and intelligence. The portrayal of the earliest astronauts as popular heroes in the US media, and beyond (Bush, for example, pays homage, in 2004, to two of the 'veterans' of the space age, Tom Delay and Senator Bill Nelson), sedimented an image of masculine achievement that, although highly contingent on the militarized aggressivity of Cold War discourse at that time, has proved enduring. Armstrong's famous announcement that the Apollo 11 Moon landing was <span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">'one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind' thus in this instance speaks more specifically than universally, a continuation of the Western history's overarching belief in men's 'natural' ability, indeed prerogative, to conquer for the good of everyone.\</span><br />

Just as in NASA and space discourse, debate and the discourse used in debate is permeated with masculine lines of thought that work to exclude women at a high school level.<br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">'I don't usually vote for girl debaters because debate really is a boy's activity. I am surprised by your ability to handle these issues.'1 This is virtually a verbatim quote received </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">by one of the authors</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> on a ballot </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">during her senior year</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> in high school.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">A woman wrote the ballot. In recent years there has been some effort to isolate the factors that limit the participation of women in collegiate debate.2</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">These studies are superfluous if the factors regarding participation of females at the high school level are not understood. Unfortunately, no such formal research attempt has been made to explain the reasons underlying the thoughts that contribute to the opening quote.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The issue of participation of other minority groups in debate is a topic beyond the scope of our discussion. The virtual non-existence of minorities is a deeply disturbing issue and deserves further investigation. Understanding gender and minority selection of debate as an activity in high school level is useful in explaining those selection factors at the collegiate level. One finds few college debaters who were not exposed to the activity in high school. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a female who has not experienced some competition and success in the activity while in high school will remain, very much less begin, debating in college. Additionally, given its competitive nature, quest for excellence, and skewed gender composition, debate offers a micro-model of the business and academic worlds</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">There are implications for female representation and treatment in these societal roles as debaters tend to become leaders in both the business and academic worlds</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">As the perceptions of women ingrained through debate experience are translated into society at large through leadership positions, the </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">implications for under-representation of women in debate takes on greater significance</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This article addresses several of the reasons behind female participation rates at the high school level and offers a few solutions to the problem. All things being equal, one would assume roughly equal numbers of male and female participants in high school debate.</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">Debate, unlike athletics, does not require physical skills which might restrict the participation of women. Additionally, debate is academically oriented and women tend to select extracurricular activities , that are more academic in nature than men</span>.3 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Based on these assumptions</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">one would expect proportional representation of the genders in the activity</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Why then, are there four times more men in debate than women</span>?<span style="font-size: 8pt;">4 Several explanations exist that begin to account for the low rate of female participation in debate. Fewer females enter the activity at the outset. Although organizational and procedural tactics used in high school debate may account for low initial rates of participation, a variety of social and structural phenomena, not necessarily caused by the debate community also account for these rates. Ultimately,</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">the disproportionate attrition rate of female debaters results in the male dominated composition of the activity. There are more disincentives for women to participate in debate than for men.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">While entry rates for women and man may in some cases be roughly equal, the total number of women who participate for four years is significantly lower than the corresponding number of men</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">This rate of attrition is due to factors that can be explained largely by an examination of the debate community itself</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Socially inculcated values contribute to low rates of female entry in high school debate. Gender bias and its relation to debate has been studied by Manchester and Freidly. They conclude,</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">&quot;[m]ales are adhering to sex-role stereotypes and sex-role expectations when they participate in debate because it is perceived as a masculine' activity. Female debate participants experience more gender-related barriers because they are not adhering to sex-role stereotypes and sex-role expectations.5 In short, 'nice girls' do not compete against or with men, are not assertive, and are not expected to engage in policy discourse,</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">particularly relating to military issues. Rather,</span> &quot;<span style="text-decoration: none;">nice girls&quot; should be cheerleaders, join foreign language clubs, or perhaps participate in student government</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It should be noted that many of these attitudes are indoctrinated at birth and cannot be directly attributed to the debate community. However</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">there are many activity specific elements that discourage female participation in high school debate.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Structural barriers endemic to the forensics community dissuade female ninth graders from entering the activity.6 Recruitment procedures and initial exposure may unintentionally create a first impression of the activity as dominated by men. By and large</span>, <span style="text-decoration: none;">it is a male debater</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or a male debate coach</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">that will discuss the activity with new students for the first time.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Additionally, most debate coaches are men</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">This reinforces a socially proven norm to prospective debaters, that debate is an activity controlled by men. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This male exposure contributes to a second barrier to participation. Parents are more likely to let a son go on an overnight than they are a daughter, particularly when the coach is male and the squad is mostly male. This may be a concern even when the coach is a trusted member of the community. While entry barriers are formidable, female attrition rates effect the number of women in the activity most significantly.7 Rates of attrition are largely related to the level of success. Given the time and money commitment involved in debate, if one is not winning one quits debating. The problem is isolating the factors that contribute to the early failure of women debaters. Even if equal numbers of males and females enter at the novice level, the female perception of debate as a whole is not based on the gender proportions of her immediate peer group. Rather, she looks to the composition of debaters across divisions. This may be easily understood if one considers the traditional structures of novice debate. Often it is the varsity debate team, composed mostly of males, who coach and judge novice. </span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">Novices also learn how to debate by watching debates. Thus, the role models will be those individuals already involved in the activity and entrenched in its values. The importance of female role models and mentors should not be underestimated.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is a proven correlation between the number of female participants and the number of female coaches and judges.8 The presence of female mentors and role models may not only help attract women to the activity, but will significantly temper the attrition rate of female debaters. Novice, female debaters have few role models and, consequently, are more likely to drop out than their male counterparts; resulting in an unending cycle of female attrition in high school debate. Pragmatically, there are certain cost benefit criteria that coaches on the high school level, given the constraints of a budget, must consider</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Coaches with teams dominated by males may be reluctant to recruit females due to traveling and housing considerations</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Thus, even if a female decides to join the team, her travel opportunities may be more limited than those of the males on the team. Once a female has &quot;proven&quot; herself, the willingness to expend team resources on her increases, assuming she overcomes the initial obstacles.</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">Perceptually, women lack the levels of confidence present in males; their expectations of success are lower, and the pressures placed upon them are higher.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">As a result of socialization, women lack confidence in their public speaking skills.</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">This coupled with the lack of role models leads female debaters to view themselves as tokens and outsiders in the activity very early.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This self perception as token &quot;females&quot; creates a performance pressure.9 For example, if</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">it is assumed that a female debater is not as competent as her male counterpart </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">there is additional pressure on the female to overcome the (not necessarily overt) expectation that she will be inadequate. For many persons</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">this stress is so counterproductive that it interferes with one's judgement, and ultimately the predication that the token will be inadequate may become a fulfilled prophecy.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Thus, in some situations performances failure is linked to performance pressure, and not the objective validity of the female debater's inabilities. This performance pressure does not require the explicit low expectations of the dominant group, but results as a consequence of simply being unique.10</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> This phenomena of performance pressure is especially prevalent on specific topics in high school debate</span>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">for example military issues. It is usually presumed that a female does not have a good grasp of military issues. Therefore, a female debater must debate not only as well as her male counterparts, but feels a need to command an even greater level of expertise in this area. Performance pressure effects selection of events and argument preference as well.11 In general</span> ' <span style="text-decoration: none;">women are not Encouraged to discuss military and political issues. Women prefer social and theoretical arguments to military issues, and this is reflected in women's choices of debate arguments.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">On the collegiate level, more women participq4e in CEDA debate as compared to NDT debate.12 On the high school level the ratio of male to female participants in individual events activities is nearly one to one.13 Therefore, even if a female is not discouraged from entering debate itself, she will not remain in the activity for long because the argument discourse either does not interest her or she is actively discouraged from becoming fluent in it. The overall rate of attrition of women in debate and their decision not to enter college debate after high school may also be related to more noticeable and determinable sexism in the debate community. Sexism is a word that has not been used thus far. Given the charged nature of this issue we have opted to focus discussion on less &quot;sensitive&quot; or &quot;more objective&quot; measures. However, as women in debate who have interviewed and surveyed other women in debate, there are several general statements we can make regarding this issue.</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">High school debate coaches, tournaments, and even trophies herald policy debate as &quot;two man&quot; debate. Often, two women debating together are referred to as &quot;the girls.&quot; Many female debaters observe that male debaters when referring to a female competitor's argument, frequently say, &quot;on his argument. . ..&quot; Also observed, are references to female debaters as honey or chicks. Other lingo of the community supports this conclusion. Arguing military issues is &quot;manly.&quot; Debating straight up is &quot;going balls up.&quot; Aggressive females are either bitchy or manly</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The effect of this type of behavior on female attrition is difficult to measure. At its core, this kind of overt sexism makes young debaters uncomfortable</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">It is offensive and intolerable. Contrary to popular opinion, women do not find it funny. By the time many females have ended their debating careers offensive language has become such a part of their daily existence that they may laugh about it. One will never know how many women are intimidated and offended to such a degree that they leave the activity before they develop the self-confidence and level of success necessary to overcome the inherent gender bias against them, a bias contributed to by the &quot;old boy&quot; tactics of the members of the community.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">If the assumption that there should be an equal number of male and female debaters is granted, reformation must begin within the existing community in order to attain this goal or the &quot;old boy&quot; traditions will remain.</span><br />

Debate is not just a game we play it shapes us as human beings it is important for us to examine the norms that the community uses to judge debate and debaters. Change is not up to the United States federal government.<br />

While reflecting on my experiences as a woman in academic debate in preparation for this essay, <span style="text-decoration: none;">I realized that I have been involved in debate for more than half of my life</span>. I debated for four years in high school, for four years in college, and I have been coaching intercollegiate debate for nine years. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Not surprisingly, much of my identity as an individual has been shaped by these experiences in debate.</span> I am a person who strongly believes that <span style="text-decoration: none;">debate empowers people to be committed and involved individuals in the communities in which they live. </span>I am a person who thrives on the intellectual stimulation involved in teaching and traveling with the brightest students on my campus. I am a person who looks forward to the opportunities for active engagement of ideas with debaters and coaches from around the country. <span style="text-decoration: none;">I am also</span>, however, a college professor<span style="text-decoration: none;">, a &quot;feminist,&quot;</span> and a peace activist <span style="text-decoration: none;">who is increasingly frustrated and disturbed by some of the practices I see being perpetuated and rewarded in academic debate</span>. I find that <span style="text-decoration: none;">I can no longer separate my involvement in debate from the rest of who I am as an individual</span>. Northwestern I remember listening to a lecture a few years ago given by Tom Goodnight at the University summer debate camp. Goodnight lamented what he saw as <span style="text-decoration: none;">the debate community's participation in, and unthinking perpetuation of what he termed the &quot;death cultur</span>e.&quot; He argued that <span style="text-decoration: none;">the embracing of &quot;big impact&quot; arguments--nuclear war, environmental destruction, genocide, famine, and the like-by debaters and coaches signals a morbid and detached fascination with such events, one that views these real human tragedies as part of a &quot;game&quot; in which so-called &quot;objective and neutral&quot; advocates actively seek to find in their research the &quot;impact to outweigh all other impacts&quot;--the round-winning argument that will carry them to their goal of winning tournament X, Y, or Z.</span> He concluded that <span style="text-decoration: none;">our &quot;use&quot; of such events in this way is tantamount to a celebration of them</span>; <span style="text-decoration: none;">our detached, rational discussions reinforce a detached, rational viewpoint, when emotional and moral outrage may be a more appropriate response</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the last few years, my academic research has led me to be persuaded by Goodnight's unspoken assumption; language is not merely some transparent tool used to transmit information, but rather is an incredibly powerful medium, the use of which inevitably has real political and material consequences. Given this assumption, I believe that</span> <span style="text-decoration: none;">it is important for us to examine the &quot;discourse of debate practice:&quot; that is, the language, discourses, and meanings that we, as a community of debaters and coaches, unthinkingly employ in academic debate</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">If it is the case that the language we use has real implications for how we view the world, how we view others, and how we act in the world, then it is imperative that we critically examine our own discourse practices with an eye to how our language does violence to others. I am shocked and surprised when I hear myself saying things like, &quot;we killed them,&quot; or &quot;take no prisoners,&quot; or &quot;let's blow them out of the water.&quot; I am tired of the &quot;ideal&quot; debater being defined as one who has mastered the art of verbal assault to the point where accusing opponents of lying, cheating, or being deliberately misleading is a sign of strength. </span> But <span style="text-decoration: none;">what I am most tired of is how women debaters are marginalized and rendered voiceless in such a discourse community. Women who verbally assault their opponents are labeled &quot;bitches&quot; because it is not socially acceptable for women to be verbally aggressive. Women who get angry and storm out of a room when a disappointing decision is rendered are labeled &quot;hysterical&quot; because, as we all know, women are more emotional then men.</span> I am tired of hearing comments like, &quot;those 'girls' from school X aren't really interested in debate; they just want to meet men.&quot; We can all point to examples (although only a few) of women who have succeeded at the top levels of debate. But <span style="text-decoration: none;">I find myself wondering how many more women gave up because they were tired of negotiating the mine field of discrimination, sexual harassment, and isolation they found in the debate community</span>. As members of this community, however, we have great freedom to define it in whatever ways we see fit. After all, <span style="text-decoration: none;">what is debate except a collection of shared understandings and explicit or implicit rules for interaction</span>? <span style="text-decoration: none;">What I am calling for is a critical examination of how we, as individual members of this community, characterize our activity, ourselves, and our interactions with others through language. We must become aware of the ways in which our mostly hidden and unspoken assumptions about what &quot;good&quot; debate is function to exclude</span> not only <span style="text-decoration: none;">women,</span> but ethnic minorities from the amazing intellectual opportunities that training in debate provides. Our nation and indeed, our planet, faces incredibly difficult challenges in the years ahead. I <span style="text-decoration: none;">believe that it is not acceptable anymore for us to go along as we always have, assuming that things will straighten themselves out. I</span>f the rioting in Los Angeles taught us anything, it is that <span style="text-decoration: none;">complacency breeds resentment and frustration. We may not be able to change the world, but we can change our own community, and if we fail to do so, we give up the only real power that we have.</span><br />
<span class="cite">This is not a call to reject debate as such; however, exposing dangerous norms allows us to seek the condition of possibility for agency which allows us to challenge the naturalization of gender in order to make life possible </span><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">We submit that with the concept of ‘normative violence’ Butler offers us a better way of thinking what Derrida calls the ‘violence of the letter’.</span> In hiseffort to counter the privileging of speech over writing in the history ofphilosophy, and perhaps in the history of the West (though Derrida really only everarguesfor the former claim, he sometimesassertsthe latter), Derrida implies, through the phrase itself, that he wants to make writing (i.e. arche-writing) into the instrument of violence. <span style="text-decoration: none;">‘Violence of the letter’ means that the text does violence, conjuring fantastic images of alphabet strips on US grade school walls that attack schoolchildren from the shadows. The metaphor</span> (and certainly the ridiculous images that we have culled from it)<span style="text-decoration: none;"> comes up short, however, since in Derrida’s own sense writing cannot be an instrument. There cannot be a violence of the text, since the text can never be a ‘thing’ in that way. Butler introduces the concept of normative violence toward the end of the 10th-anniversary preface to Gender Trouble. </span>‘I grew up’, she writes, ‘understanding something ofthe violence of gender norms: an uncle incarceratedfor his anatomically anomalous body<span style="font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;">. . .</span>gay cousins forced to leave their homes<span style="font-family: Helvetica,sans-serif;">. . .</span>my own tempestuous coming out at the age of 16’ (Butler 1999: xix, emphasis added). We would typically think of these examples as vio- lence, or perhaps merely inconveniences, done to sovereign individuals becausethey have violated gender norms. Butler describes the situationquite differently by attributing the agency of the violence not to outside forces, but to the norms themselves. <span style="text-decoration: none;">This is ‘the violence of gender norms’, not the violence of bigots – normative violence, not simple (yet no less horrendous for that) gay-bashing. Butler goes on to explain and unravel the counter-intuitive nature of her description of normative violence, and she suggests that only retroactively can one see normative violence clearly. This retroactive seeing likely applies both to Butler’s description of her time growing up, ‘understanding some- thing’ of normative violence, and to her redescription of the work of Gender Trouble in the terms of normative violence. In either case, the difﬁculty lies in making such violence visible</span>. Butler continues: ‘it was difﬁcult to bring this violence into view precisely because gender was so taken for granted at the same time that it was violently policed’ (Butler 1999: xix). <span style="text-decoration: none;">The work of denaturalising gender thus does not serve the end of making gender com- pletely ‘ﬂuid’ and thereby utterly meaningless. Rather, the denaturalisation of nature seeks to ‘bring . . . this [normative] violence into view’. Thus we see a shift from a narrow reading of Gender Trouble that would </span>(conﬁned bya frame of standpoint feminism) <span style="text-decoration: none;">take Butler to be arguing for an expanded (but unhelpful) sense of women’s agency, to a more general political and theoretical (as well as queer) context in which Butler offers a radical rethinking of agency itself. Butler seeks to expose prior conditions of pos- sibility for agency as found within norms, not merely to call for a ‘choice’ of more genders. Butler’s description of the challenge posed by the task of rendering nor- mative violence perceptible and observable must be further scrutinised</span>. Again, her account can be read as a post hoc description of her experiences growing up, <span style="text-decoration: none;">in which the naturalisation of gender masks the very violence of gender norms.</span> However, if ‘gender was so taken for granted’, it seems obvious that the same can be said of sexuality. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Even Butler’s examples above make it clear that these violent ‘gender norms’ are always and already norms of sexuality as well</span>: each of the examples goes beyond a betrayal of gender norms to a deviation from the norm of heterosexuality. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Norms of gender, as both the examples here and the book as a whole illustrate, always remain underwritten and overwritten by norms of sexuality, and particu- larly by heteronormativity.</span> Thus we catch a glimpse here of what we will argue in Chapters 6 and 7: Butler reworks gender within the context of her queer critique of heteronormativity.Butler draws these links herself on the very next page, at the place where she ﬁrst uses the phrase ‘normative violence’. We see the concept emerge not merely as a supplement to the lexicon already introduced byGender Trouble– and then advanced and reﬁned by Butler’s other texts. Instead, <span style="text-decoration: none;">Butler, retroactively, places normative violence at the very core of the text, as the central political concept. Butler writes: ‘the dogged effort to ‘‘dena- turalize’’ gender in this text emerges,</span> I think, <span style="text-decoration: none;">from a strong desire to coun- ter the normative violence implied by ideal morphologies of sex and to uproot the pervasive assumptions about natural or presumptive hetero- sexuality’</span> (Butler 1999 [1990]: xx) <span style="text-decoration: none;">Thus, the task of exposing the thor- oughly constructed nature of gender – that is, the effort to show that gender is anything but natural – can never be dissociated from the challenge to heteronormativity. Until the presumption of heterosexuality is ‘uprooted’ gender could never be ‘denaturalised’</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">And, looking at it from the other side, we can say that Butler denaturalises gender precisely through her cri- tique of heteronormativity. The ‘naturalness’ attributed to women’s ‘nur- turing’ qualities, the pathos of male–female relations</span> (where women are relation-oriented and men are autonomous<span style="text-decoration: none;">), all this was what we might call a ‘gift’ from the heterosexual matrix. Thus the normative violence of which Butler speaks and to which she seeks a response must be understood as always involving the norms of sex, gender and sexuality at the same time.</span> We are trying to show here that Butler’s account of normative violence – highlighted in the preface, but latent in the book – serves as an answer to the most pointed, the most repeated, the most vociferous charges of her critics: ‘<span style="text-decoration: none;">the writing of this denaturalization was not done simply out of a desire to play with language or prescribe theatrical antics. . . . It was done from a desire to live, to make life possible’ </span>(Butler 1999: xx, emphasis added). The ﬁrst half of this claim obviously speaks to critics of post- structuralism broadly, critics who would describe the work of radical con- structivists as mere play with language (see Benhabib 1995a, 1995b); it also offers a rejoinder to the speciﬁc criticism ofGender Troubleas a call to turn gender into theatre (Hawkes 1995; cf. Lloyd 2005a). The second half of the quotation comes across much less clearly: <span style="text-decoration: none;">what does it mean ‘to make life possible’?</span> On its surface, the claim might echo as hollow, as a merely rhetorical response to critics – balancing the seriousness of ‘a desire to live’ with the frivolity of ‘play’ but without substance to back up the rhetoric. Quite the contrary:<span style="text-decoration: none;"> the concept of normative violence provides the sub- stantial grounding for this claim. When read within the framework of normative violence, the effort to ‘make life possible’ comes to light as a serious politico-theoretical effort. The denaturalisation of our reiﬁed notions of sex/gender serves the political end of resisting and countering normative violence. To expose the workings of normative violence is the ﬁrst step in challenging it.</span><span style="font-family: Times-Roman,serif;"> One could read, for example, the modern history of ‘gay liberation’ over the past 35 years as a claiming of rights (and a struggle for them) by already-constituted political subjects. This is the standard story, presumed by the mainstream gay movement that makes gay marriage the ﬁnal and ultimate achievement in this progressive history. But recently queer writers have been trying to tell a different story; authors such as Michael Warner (1999) and Butler herself (Butleret al.2000) have challenged the dominant narrative, showing that ‘gay liberation’ had its roots in an alliance against normative sexuality, an alliance formed by gays, lesbians, sex-workers, transgendered people, people with AIDS, family and friends of those with AIDS, and a whole host of others that could never be subsumed by an ‘etc.’ or encompassed within today’s mainstream gay movement. </span><span style="text-decoration: none;">Thisalternative narrative can be read powerfully as a battle against normative violence.</span><br />

The White House has announced plans to host a conference in Florida on April 15 during which President Obama will unveil his vision for the U. S. space program. If recent moves by the administration are any indication, this new vision will significantly curtail public funding for space activity. The president is working hard to spin the upcoming change as a transition rather than a cut, and perhaps for good reason: He is unlikely to find a receptive audience in Florida, long a recipient of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s largess. But while the swing-state politics of the Sunshine State may compel Obama to tread carefully, we as the general public should recognize this new policy for what it is: a dramatic reduction in human space exploration. We should also support Obama for his fiscal discipline in cutting what has been a horrendous waste of our society’s resources. With apologies to Dwight Eisenhower, the cost of one modern space shuttle is this: one and a half million lives lost for wont of anti-malarial bed nets. It is electricity to power a U. S. city of two million people for a year. It is nine-hundred billion gallons of fresh drinking water produced by desalination. We pay for a single shuttle launch with fifty million bushels of wheat. We house a handful of men in space with a year’s worth of housing for more than ten million U. S. citizens. NASA is not just spending money. It is spending the sweat of our laborers, the genius of our scientists, the hopes of our children. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the clouds of this space-industrial complex, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron. Proponents claim that on its route to the stars, NASA has completed research that has benefited the rest of mankind. It is true, NASA research has led to many discoveries: Besides its many advances in satellites and computing, NASA can also claim credit for a host of more mundane things — quartz timing crystals, bar-code scanners, smoke detectors, cordless screwdrivers, and velcro. But let us not deceive ourselves into thinking that all of NASA’s budget can be recompensed by the occasional spin-offs from its R&amp;D program. Let us not buy into the delusion that all of the low-hanging fruit that NASA has picked over the years would have gone undiscovered forever, or that we would never have achieved satellites without luxuries such as the Apollo missions. Not only is it the case that research is a small component of NASA’s activities, but it should also be self-evident that had NASA’s budget been applied directly to the betterment of humanity, the direct gains of that spending would have outweighed the tangential gains from the occasional cross-utilization of space technology here on earth. Think about it this way: MIT, from a mixture of tuition, government funding, and endowment payouts, spends $2. 5 billion to keep itself running. NASA costs more than $17 billion. Over the past four decades, instead of NASA, we could have had at least six additional MIT’s. Consider all of the research that our single MIT has produced during that period, all of the students taught and leadership provided. For all the gains that NASA has made, its opportunity costs are far greater. Something does not need to be a 100 percent complete and total waste in order to call it wasteful. Even the most hard-hearted of critics must admit that the organization has chalked up many victories in the fight to improve the world. But humanity deserves more than just the scraps of NASA’s occasional research. Humanity deserves better than the continuation of an ill-advised space race with a geopolitical enemy that disappeared nearly two decades ago. Humanity deserves our full and undivided attention — no more playing golf on the moon or entertaining fanciful notions of putting men on Mars. Feeding and clothing people might not be as sexy as space exploration, but in the broader picture it is a just and nobler goal. Mr. Levinger argues that NASA is small potatoes, a mere drop in the bucket compared to, say, spending on the military. But just because NASA is a small waste, or a waste among many, does not mean it isn’t waste, or that it should be ignored. Nothing should be given a free pass. For every dollar spent, we should consider the human cost. That sounds melodramatic, but it is hard not to sound melodramatic when a billion people live on less than a dollar per day. When you have to make choices between food, water, and shelter, considering the human cost of a dollar isn’t melodramatic — it’s routine. Mr. Levinger may not see a direct connection between our society spending resources in one area, and going without in another, but to those who understand the functioning of the free market, the connection is clear. An engineer who works for NASA developing zero-g fluid pumps is not an engineer developing water pumps for rural Africa. A tax dollar taken to purchase a bolt is a dollar not given through charity to buy food for a hungry child. The slightest of upticks in the price of aluminum for a shuttle wing shifts millions of dollars of investment across the world. The fungibility is not perfect, and Mr. Levinger is right to point this out. But a NASA dollar does not come directly out of the world’s budget for candy and cosmetics either. The more poetic among us say that NASA has given millions hope, that it is a symbol of the ingenuity and ambition of the human race. Mr. Levinger himself thinks of it as “heroic. ” I disagree. Why should it be the case that investing in space travel is more inspiring than spending that money on the poorest of our fellow man? Doesn’t such an obsession with space imply not that we are an ambitious race, but instead that we doubt the goodness of human nature? Doesn’t it suggest that we are so convinced of our inevitable self-destruction that we would rather fling ourselves into the hostile unknown than risk submitting ourselves to the cruelties of our fellow man? Where others see an adventurer’s spirit, I see existential worry and cowardly desperation. Every thruster that is made, every spaceship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. Rather than gambling on the stars, why not inspire our children by investing in ourselves, by committing to the belief that human life on Earth is sustainable, by devoting new resources to overcome the problems that we face? The cold war is over. The political one-upmanship that NASA was founded upon is a thing of the past. It is time to recognize that mankind has higher priorities than planting flags on planets.<br />

<br />
Towards the notion of biopolitics in Arendt’s thought What does it mean to characterize the present equation of politics and violence in terms of biopolitics? And how can this non-Arendtian notion make sense within Arendt’s work? Let us begin with the first question. My contention is that the distinguishing mark of the political from the turn of the nineteen century to the present day is the following paradox: the elevation of life to the status of the supreme good combined with the multiplication of instances in which life is degraded to the utmost. I believe, therefore, that the constitutive element of the political in the present is the reduction of citizenship to the level of “bare life”, as Agamben understands it. Human life is thus politicised, divided between life included and protected by the political and economic community and life excluded and unprotected, exposed to degradation and death 10) As to the second question – how the notion of biopolitics may fit into Arendt’s work: we find an answer encapsulated in Arendt’s thesis regarding the “unnatural growth of the natural,” a peculiar formula meant to capture the main historical transformations of the modern age. This notion comprehends a range of different historical phenomena stemming from the Industrial Revolution, such as: the spread of the capitalist form of production; the widening of the realm of human ‘life processes’ (that is, labouring and consuming), to the point that life itself becomes the supreme good and the furtherance of these processes (which centre on the private interests of animal laborans) the most important object of politics; the requirement of the continuous production and consumption of goods in ever increasing abundance, so that nature is reduced to a stock of natural resources – a stock abused to the point where its self-reproducing character is endangered; the promotion of labouring activity to the status of the most important human activity and the concomitant understanding of human beings primarily as animal laborans, a living being whose needs are satisfied by the cycle of labouring and consuming. In this process the public sphere is transformed into a social one, that is, a market for economic exchanges based on a cycle of ceaseless production and consumption. From the nineteenth century onwards, then, the political realm has been overrun by individual, social and economic interests, which today we see massed in the form of international corporations, coercive international trade regimes, financial globalisation and free-market ideologies. This results from politics becoming the activity of managing the production and reproduction ofanimal laborans’ life and happiness. To put it in Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt’s terms, the industrial and financial powers of the present produce not only commodities, but also subjectivities, needs, social relations, bodies and minds, since they actually produce the producers. Politically, perhaps the most salient consequence of this historical process is that we do not know if there is even any space left for the establishment of new and radical political alternatives, since all state policies – above all in underdeveloped countries – are always subject to the decidedly unstable flows of international financial investments, stock-exchange fluctuations and global financial institutions such as the World Bank. The changes associated with the development of global capitalism imply many losses, if we follow Arendt: the loss of the political as a space of freedom, replaced by requirements of economic necessity; free and spontaneous action replaced by predictable, conformist behaviour;11)he subordination of public and shared interests to those of private lobbies and other hidden pressure groups, freed from public vigilance by the withering of the public realm; the submission of all political opinion to the supposedly inexorable laws of market economics; the substitution of violence for the power won through persuasion; the weakening of the citizen’s ability to consent and to dissent, our ability to act in concert replaced at best by the solitary experience of voting; the reduction of the political arena to disputes among bureaucratic and oligarchic party machines; with a compliant media depicting those who do not accept their game-rules as ‘anarchists,’ ‘rioters,’ even ‘terrorists. ’ The ‘citizen’ consumes in the democratic-supermarket: choose from a strictly limited variety of political brands, with no option to question the political options on offer. (And what would the question be when all political parties declare that their aim is to protect citizens’ interests and quality of life?) As Agamben argues, to question the limitations of our political system has become more and more difficult since politics has been declared as the task of caring for and administering bare life. In this situation, traditional political distinctions (right-left, liberalism-totalitarianism, private-public) have lost their intelligibility, since all political categories are subordinated to the demands of bare life. Since “capitalism has become one with reality,” we are condemned, in Marina Garcés’s words, ‘to make choices in an elective space in which there are no options. Everything is possible, but we can do nothing. ’12). Even the practices and discourses of the so-called anti-globalisation movements – “another globalisation is possible” and the like – are largely unable to create real alternatives to the economic realities they are intent on confronting. These historic transformations have not only brought more violence to the core of the political but have also redefined its character by giving rise to biopolitical violence. As stated, what characterizes biopolitics is a dynamic of both protecting and abandoning life through its inclusion and exclusion from the political and economic community. In Arendtian terms, the biopolitical danger is best described as the risk of converting animal laborans into Agamben’s homo sacer, the human being who can be put to death by anyone and whose killing does not imply any crime whatsoever 13). When politics is conceived of as biopolitics, as the task of increasing the life and happiness of the nationalanimal laborans, the nation-state becomes ever more violent and murderous. If we link Arendt’s thesis from The Human Condition to those of The Origins of Totalitarianism, we can see the Nazi and Stalinist extermination camps as the most refined experiments in annihilating the “bare life” of animal laborans (although these are by no means the only instances in which the modern state has devoted itself to human slaughter). Arendt is not concerned only with the process of the extermination itself, but also the historical situation in which large-scale exterminations were made possible – above all, the emergence of ‘uprooted’ and ‘superfluous’ modern masses, what we might describe as animal laborans balanced on the knife-edge of ‘bare life. ’ Compare her words in ‘Ideology and Terror’ (1953), which became the conclusion of later editions of The Origins of Totalitarianism: Isolation is that impasse into which men are driven when the political sphere of their lives… is destroyed… Isolated man who lost his place in the political realm of action is deserted by the world of things as well, if he is no longer recognized as homo faber but treated as an animal laborans whose necessary ‘metabolism with nature’ is of concern to no one. Isolation then become loneliness… Loneliness, the common ground for terror, the essence of totalitarian government, and for ideology or logicality, the preparation of its executioners and victims, is closely connected with uprootedness and superfluousness which have been the curse of modern masses since the beginning of the industrial revolution and have become acute with the rise of imperialism at the end of the last century and the break-down of political institutions and social traditions in our own time. To be uprooted means to have no place in the world, recognized and guaranteed by others; to be superfluous means not to belong to the world at all 14). The conversion of homo faber, the human being as creator of durable objects and institutions, into animal laborans and, later on, into homo sacer, can be traced in Arendt’s account of nineteenth century imperialism. As argued in the second volume of The Origins of Totalitarianism, European colonialism combined racism and bureaucracy to perpetrate the “most terrible massacres in recent history, the Boers’ extermination of Hottentot tribes, the wild murdering by Carl Peters in German Southeast Africa, the decimation of the peaceful Congo population – from 20 to 40 million reduced to 8 million people; and finally, perhaps worst of all, it resulted in the triumphant introduction of such means of pacification into ordinary, respectable foreign policies. ” 15) This simultaneous protection and destruction of life was also at the core of the two World Wars, as well as in many other more local conflicts, during which whole populations have become stateless or deprived of a public realm. In spite of all their political differences, the United States of Roosevelt, the Soviet Russia of Stalin, the Nazi Germany of Hitler and the Fascist Italy of Mussolini were all conceived of as states devoted to the needs of the national animal laborans. According to Agamben, since our contemporary politics recognizes no other value than life, Nazism and fascism, that is, regimes which have taken bare life as their supreme political criterion are bound to remain standing temptations 16). Finally, it is obvious that this same logic of promoting and annihilating life persists both in post-industrial and in underdeveloped countries, inasmuch as economic growth depends on the increase of unemployment and on many forms of political exclusion. When politics is reduced to the tasks of administering, preserving and promoting the life and happiness of animal laborans it ceases to matter that those objectives require increasingly violent acts, both in national and international arenas. Therefore, we should not be surprised that the legality of state violence has become a secondary aspect in political discussions, since what really matters is to protect and stimulate the life of the national (or, as the case may be, Western) animal laborans. In order to maintain sacrosanct ideals of increased mass production and mass consumerism, developed countries ignore the finite character of natural reserves and refuse to sign International Protocols regarding natural resource conservation or pollution reduction, thereby jeopardising future humanity. They also launch preventive attacks and wars, disregard basic human rights, for instance in extra-legal detention camps such as Guantánamo,27) and multiply refugee camps. Some countries have even imprisoned whole populations, physically isolating them from other communities, in a new form of social, political and economic apartheid. In short, states permit themselves to impose physical and structural violence against individuals and regimes (‘rogue states’ 18) ) that supposedly interfere with the security and growth of their national ‘life process. ’ If, according to Arendt, the common world consists of an institutional in-between meant to outlast both human natality and mortality, in modern mass societies we find the progressive abolition of the institutional artifice that separates and protects our world from the forces of nature 19). This explains the contemporary feeling of disorientation and unhappiness, likewise the political impossibility we find in combining stability and novelty 20). In the context of a “waste economy, in which things must be almost as quickly devoured and discarded as they have appeared in the world, if the process itself is not to come to a sudden catastrophic end,” 21) it is not only possible, but also necessary, that people themselves become raw material to be consumed, discarded, annihilated. In other words, when Arendt announces the “grave danger that eventually no object of the world will be safe from consumption and annihilation through consumption,” 22) we should also remember that human annihilation, once elevated to the status of an ‘end-in-itself’ in totalitarian regimes, still continues to occur – albeit in different degrees and by different methods, in contemporary ‘holes of oblivion’ such as miserably poor Third World neighbourhoods 23) and penitentiaries, underpaid and slave labour camps, in the name of protecting the vital interests of animal laborans. To talk about a process of human consumption is not to speak metaphorically but literally. Heidegger had realized this in his notes written during the late thirties, later published under the title of Overcoming Metaphysics. He claimed that the difference between war and peace had already been blurred in a society in which “metaphysical man, the animal rationale, gets fixed as the labouring animal,” so that “labour is now reaching the metaphysical rank of the unconditional objectification of everything present. ” 24) Heidegger argued that once the world becomes fully determined by the “circularity of consumption for the sake of consumption” it is at the brink of becoming an ‘unworld’ (Unwelt), since ‘man, who no longer conceals his character of being the most important raw material, is also drawn into the process. Man is “the most important raw material” because he remains the subject of all consumption. ’ 25) After the Second World War and the release of detailed information concerning the death factories Heidegger took his critique even further, acknowledging that to understand man as both subject and object of the consumption process would still not comprehend the process of deliberate mass extermination. He saw this, instead, in terms of the conversion of man into no more than an “item of the reserve fund for the fabrication of corpses” (Bestandestücke eines Bestandes der Fabrikation von Leichen). According to Heidegger, what happened in the extermination camps was that death became meaningless, and the existential importance of our anxiety in the face of death was lost; instead, people were robbed of the essential possibility of dying, so that they merely “passed away” in the process of being “inconspicuously liquidated” (unauffällig liquidiert). 26) The human being as animal laborans (Arendt), as homo sacer (Agamben), as an ‘item of the reserve fund’ (Heidegger) – all describe the same process of dehumanisation whereby humankind is reduced to the bare fact of being alive, with no further qualifications. As argued by Agamben, when it becomes impossible to differentiate between biós and zóe, that is, when bare life is transformed into a qualified or specific ‘form of life,’ we face the emergence of a biopolitical epoch 27). When states promote the animalisation of man by policies that aim at both protecting and destroying human life, we can interpret this in terms of the widespread presence of the homo sacer in our world: “If it is true that the figure proposed by our age is that of an unsacrificeable life that has nevertheless become capable of being killed to an unprecedented degree, then the bare life of homo sacer concerns us in a special way… If today there is no longer any one clear figure of the sacred man, it is perhaps because we are all virtually homines sacri. ” 28) Investigating changes in the way power was conceived of and exercised at the turn of the nineteenth century, Foucault realized that when life turned out to be a constitutive political element, managed, calculated, and normalized by means of biopolitics, political strategies soon became murderous. Paradoxically, when the Sovereign’s prerogative ceased to be simply that of imposing violent death, and became a matter of promoting the growth of life, wars became more and more bloody, mass killing more frequent. Political conflicts now aimed at preserving and intensifying the life of the winners, so that enmity ceased to be political and came to be seen biologically: it is not enough to defeat the enemy; it must be exterminated as a danger to the health of the race, people or community. Thus Foucault on the formation of the modern biopolitical paradigm at the end of the nineteenth century: …death that was based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure, maintain or develop its life. Yet wars were never as bloody as they have been since the nineteenth century, and all things being equal, never before did regimes visit such holocausts on their own populations. But this formidable power of death… now presents itself as the counterpart of a power that exerts a positive influence on life that endeavours to administer, optimise, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations. Wars are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign who must be defended; they are waged on behalf of the existence of everyone; entire populations are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter in the name of life necessity: massacres have become vital. It is as managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race, that so many regimes have been able to wage so many wars, causing so many men to be killed. And through a turn that closes the circle, as the technology of wars have caused them to tend increasingly toward all-out destruction, the decision that initiates them and the one that terminates them are in fact increasingly informed by the naked question of survival. The atomic situation is now at the end of point of this process: the power to expose a whole population to death is the underside of the power to guarantee an individual’s continued existence. The principle underlying the tactics of battle – that one has to be capable of killing in order to go on living – has become the principle that defines the strategy of states. But the existence in question is no longer the juridical existence of sovereignty; at stake is the biological existence of a population. If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population. 29) Expressed in terms of biopolitics, the death of the other does not imply only my own security and safety; inasmuch as the death of the other is the ‘death of the bad race, of the inferior race (or the degenerate, or the abnormal)’ it has to be understood as ‘something that will make life in general healthier; healthier and purer. ’30) In On Violence, Arendt argued a similar thesis concerning the violent character of racist and naturalist conceptions of politics: “Nothing could be theoretically more dangerous than the tradition of organic thought in political matters”; if power and violence are interpreted in terms of biological metaphors this can only produce more violence, especially where race is involved. Racism as an ideological system of thought is inherently violent, indeed murderous, because it attacks natural ‘biological’ data that, as such, cannot be changed by any power or persuasion, so that when conflicts become radicalised all that can be done is to ‘exterminate’ the other 31). Biopolitical violence is the result of a naturalized conception of the political, found both in totalitarianism and the quasi-totalitarian elements of modern mass democracies. For Arendt, all forms of naturalising the political threaten the political artifice of egalitarianism, without which no defence and validation of human freedom and dignity are possible. Arendt’s analysis of the terrible experience of refugees, of those interned in different kinds of concentration camps, of those left with no home and all those who have lost a secure place in the world, showed her that nature – and, of course, human nature – cannot ground and secure any rights or, indeed, any democratic politics. This revealed the paradox inherent in a naturalistic understanding of the Rights of Man, since once those rights ceased to be recognized and enforced by a political community, their inalienable character simply vanished, leaving unprotected the very human beings that most needed them: “The Rights of Man, supposedly inalienable, proved to be unenforceable… whenever people appeared who were no longer citizens of a sovereign state. ” 32) The loss of the Rights of Man qua rights of the citizen did not itself deprive a human being of his/her life, liberty, property, freedom of expression or freedom to pursue his happiness. The real predicament for people in these circumstances is that they “no longer belong to any community whatsoever. Their plight is not that they are not equal before the law, but that no law exists for them. ” 33) In other words, nationalistic and racialised biopolitics has produced a huge mass of people denied what Arendt termed the “right to have rights,” that is, the “right to belong to some kind of organized community”: “Man, it turns out, can lose all so-called Rights of Man without losing his essential quality as man, his human dignity. Only the loss of a polity itself expels him from humanity. ” 34) The “abstract nakedness” of merely being a human being is no substitute for the artificial character of the pacts freely entered into by active citizens. By analysing the dynamic of the extermination camps, Arendt understood that humanity is an attribute that goes categorically beyond the notion of the human being as a mere natural living being: “man’s ‘nature’ is only ‘human’ insofar as it opens up to man the possibility of becoming something highly unnatural, that is, a man. ” 35) In other words, humanity, politically speaking, does not reside in the natural fact of being alive; politically, humanity depends on artificial legal and political institutions to protect it. The Arendtian rejection of understanding the human being as a living being in the singular, as well as her postulation of human plurality as the condition of all genuine politics, depend on her thesis that politics has to do with the formation of a common world in the course of people’s acting and exchanging opinions. Politics depends on the human faculty of opinion, our capacities to agree and disagree, so that what is mysteriously given to us by nature ceases to be politically decisive. For Arendt, equality is not a natural given, but a political construction oriented by the ‘principle of justice’. It is the result of agreement to grant one another equal rights, based on the assumption that equality can be forged by those who act and exchange opinions among themselves and thus change the world in which they live. 36) According to Arendt, there can be no politics worthy of the name unless everyone is included in the political and economic community of a definite state. Without being recognised and protected as a citizen, no human being can discover his/her own place in the world. Agamben’s thesis goes even further than Arendt’s. He finds that modern biopolitics is contained in the Declaration of the Rights of Man, inasmuch as these rights constitute the very inscription of naked life into the political-juridical order. According to Agamben, in the 1789 Declaration natural bare life is both the foundational source and the carrier of the rights of man, since a man’s bare life – or, more precisely, the very fact of being born in a certain territory – is the element that effects the transition from the ancien régime’s principle of divine sovereignty to modern sovereignty concentrated in the nation state: It is not possible to understand the ‘national’ and biopolitical development and vocation of the modern state in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries if one forgets that what lies at its basis is not man as a free and conscious political subject but, above all, man’s bare life, the simple birth that as such is, in the passage from subject to citizen, invested with the principle of sovereignty. 37) Conclusion To conclude this text, I would like to underline how much Arendt’s principal reflections on totalitarianism still remain relevant nowadays, especially when we remember the feeble character of actually existing democracies. Rephrased in terms of biopolitics, the core of Arendt’s diagnosis of the present is that whenever politics has mostly to do with the maintenance and increase of the vital metabolism of affluent nation states, animal laborans is necessarily degraded still further: to the status of homo sacer, bare and unprotected life that can be delivered to oblivion and death. Our ‘common sense’ understanding of politics as the administrative promotion of abundance and the happiness of the human being as animal laborans is in fact correlated with economic and political exclusion, racialised prejudice, violence and even genocide against the naked life of homo sacer. Arendt thus sheds light on our current dilemmas, providing us theoretical elements for a critical diagnosis of the present as well as for opening new possibilities for collective action in the world. Arendt was a master of chiaroscuro political thinking, never blind to always open possibilities of radically renovating the political, nor, by brutal contrast, to the intrinsic connection between political exclusion and violence under a biopolitical paradigm. If we wish to remain with Arendt and the hope of a politics of freedom and equality, then we must reflect on and pursue new spaces and forms of political association, action and discussion, wherever and whenever they may subvert the tedious multiplication of the same in our administered, covertly and overtly violent present. Arendt proposed no political utopias, but she remained convinced that our political dilemmas have no necessary outcome, that history has not and will not come to a tragic end. Neither a pessimist nor an optimist, she wanted only to understand the world in which she lived in and to stimulate our thinking and acting in the present. It is always possible that radically new political constellations will come into our world, and responsibility for them will always be ours. If we wish to remain faithful to the spirit of Arendt’s political thinking, then we must think and act politically without constraining our thinking and acting in terms of some pre-defined understanding of what politics ‘is’ or ‘should’ be. In other words, I believe that the political challenge of the present is to multiply the forms, possibilities and spaces in which we can act politically. These may be strategic actions destined to further the agendas of political parties concerned with social justice. They can also be discrete, subversive actions favoured by small groups at the margins of the bureaucratised party machines, promoting political interventions free of particular strategic intentions, since their goal is to invite radical politicisation of existence. Finally, there are also actions in which ethical openness towards otherness becomes political: small and rather inconspicuous actions of acknowledging and welcoming, of extending hospitality and solidarity towards others.<br />

The Cosmos: Capitalism’s New “Outside” Instead of indulging in over-optimistic and fantastic visions, we should take a longer, harder, and more critical look at what is happening and what is likely to happen. We can then begin taking a more measured view of space humanization, and start developing more progressive alternatives. At this point, we must return to the deeper, underlying processes which are at the heart of the capitalist economy and society, and which are generating this demand for expansion into outer space. Although the humanization of the cosmos is clearly a new and exotic development, the social relationships and mechanisms underlying space-humanization are very familiar. In the early twentieth century, Rosa Luxemburg argued that an “outside” to capitalism is important for two main reasons. First, it is needed as a means of creating massive numbers of new customers who would buy the goods made in the capitalist countries. 7 As outlined earlier, space technology has extended and deepened this process, allowing an increasing number of people to become integral to the further expansion of global capitalism. Luxemburg’s second reason for imperial expansion is the search for cheap supplies of labor and raw materials. Clearly, space fiction fantasies about aliens aside, expansion into the cosmos offers no benefits to capital in the form of fresh sources of labor power. 8 But expansion into the cosmos does offer prospects for exploiting new materials such as those in asteroids, the moon, and perhaps other cosmic entities such as Mars. Neil Smith’s characterization of capital’s relations to nature is useful at this point. The reproduction of material life is wholly dependent on the production and reproduction of surplus value. To this end, capital stalks the Earth in search of material resources; nature becomes a universal means of production in the sense that it not only provides the subjects, objects and instruments of production, but is also in its totality an appendage to the production process…no part of the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere, the oceans, the geological substratum or the biological superstratum are immune from transformation by capital. 9 Capital is now also “stalking” outer space in the search for new resources and raw materials. Nature on a cosmic scale now seems likely to be incorporated into production processes, these being located mainly on earth. Since Luxemburg wrote, an increasing number of political economists have argued that the importance of a capitalist “outside” is not so much that of creating a new pool of customers or of finding new resources. 10 Rather, an outside is needed as a zone into which surplus capital can be invested. Economic and social crisis stems less from the problem of finding new consumers, and more from that of finding, making, and exploiting zones of profitability for surplus capital. Developing “outsides” in this way is also a product of recurring crises, particularly those of declining economic profitability. These crises are followed by attempted “fixes” in distinct geographic regions. The word “fix” is used here both literally and figuratively. On the one hand, capital is being physically invested in new regions. On the other hand, the attempt is to fix capitalism’s crises. Regarding the latter, however, there are, of course, no absolute guarantees that such fixes will really correct an essentially unstable social and economic system. At best, they are short-term solutions. The kind of theory mentioned above also has clear implications for the humanization of the cosmos. Projects for the colonization of outer space should be seen as the attempt to make new types of “spatial fix,” again in response to economic, social, and environmental crises on earth.<br />
Outer space will be “globalized,” i. e. , appended to Earth, with new parts of the cosmos being invested in by competing nations and companies. Military power will inevitably be made an integral part of this process, governments protecting the zones for which they are responsible. Some influential commentators argue that the current problem for capitalism is that there is now no “outside. ”11 Capitalism is everywhere. Similarly, resistance to capitalism is either everywhere or nowhere. But, as suggested above, the humanization of the cosmos seriously questions these assertions. New “spatial fixes”- are due to be opened up in the cosmos, capitalism’s emergent outside. At first, these will include artificial fixes such as satellites, space stations, and space hotels. But during the next twenty years or so, existing outsides, such as the moon and Mars, will begin attracting investments. The stage would then be set for wars in outer space between nations and companies attempting to make their own cosmic “fixes. ”<br />

Outer spatial fixes: for war or peace? These fixes could easily become the basis for a new global war, one in which a militarized outer space would be an important part. This is because there is a potential and actual contradiction between regional ‘fixes’ such as those attempted by China, India and Japan and the demands for capital to find new sources of accumulation. A regional fix is often made ‘autarchic’: a zone that, on account of active state intervention, allows limited trade with the outside world. As Harvey (2006) suggests, this may not be a problem so long as there are sufficient resources of capital and labour in the region in question for local capital to continue accu- mulation. But, if this is not the case, capital will inevitably move elsewhere. In the process, however, it confronts other capitalist enterprises over access to labour and resources. Nationally based private enterprises therefore finish up competing for shrinking opportunities for accumulation and this indeed is a recipe for potent ial armed conflict. As the next chapter discusses in more detail, China, Japan and India are amongst the countries now attempting to secure military presences in outer space. If Harvey’s theory is correct, these are means of protecting regional interests by ensuring that capital in these regions will have ready access to resources and labour beyond their own limits. Regional investments in outer space could thereby form an important form of future wars over resources, hostilities which could even include confrontations with the military might of the United States. Initially these conflicts might be land-based with satellites engaged in surveillance and the guid- ing of Earth-based weapons, but later they could easily be of a ‘star wars’ type with hostilities taking place in outer space. As Harvey points out, war can be seen as the ultimate and most catastrophic form of ‘devaluation’: one in which whole societies are obliterated and the prospects for a new round of investment and accumulation may be started.<br />

It is time to try to describe, at first abstractly and later concretely, a strategy for destroying capitalism. This strategy, at its most basic, calls for pulling time, energy, and resources out of capitalist civilization and putting them into building a new civilization. The image then is one of emptying out capitalist structures, hollowing them out, by draining wealth, power, and meaning out of them until there is nothing left but shells. This is definitely an aggressive strategy. It requires great militancy, and constitutes an attack on the existing order. The strategy clearly recognizes that capitalism is the enemy and must be destroyed, but it is not a frontal attack aimed at overthrowing the system, but an inside attack aimed at gutting it, while simultaneously replacing it with something better, something we want. Thus capitalist structures (corporations, governments, banks, schools, etc. ) are not seized so much as simply abandoned. Capitalist relations are not fought so much as they are simply rejected. We stop participating in activities that support (finance, condone) the capitalist world and start participating in activities that build a new world while simultaneously undermining the old. We create a new pattern of social relations alongside capitalist relations and then we continually build and strengthen our new pattern while doing every thing we can to weaken capitalist relations. In this way our new democratic, non-hierarchical, non-commodified relations can eventually overwhelm the capitalist relations and force them out of existence. This is how it has to be done. This is a plausible, realistic strategy. To think that we could create a whole new world of decent social arrangements overnight, in the midst of a crisis, during a so-called revolution, or during the collapse of capitalism, is foolhardy. Our new social world must grow within the old, and in opposition to it, until it is strong enough to dismantle and abolish capitalist relations. Such a revolution will never happen automatically, blindly, determinably, because of the inexorable, materialist laws of history. It will happen, and only happen, because we want it to, and because we know what we’re doing and know how we want to live, and know what obstacles have to be overcome before we can live that way, and know how to distinguish between our social patterns and theirs. But we must not think that the capitalist world can simply be ignored, in a live and let live attitude, while we try to build new lives elsewhere. (There is no elsewhere. ) There is at least one thing, wage-slavery, that we can’t simply stop participating in (but even here there are ways we can chip away at it). Capitalism must be explicitly refused and replaced by something else. This constitutes War, but it is not a war in the traditional sense of armies and tanks, but a war fought on a daily basis, on the level of everyday life, by millions of people. It is a war nevertheless because the accumulators of capital will use coercion, brutality, and murder, as they have always done in the past, to try to block any rejection of the system. They have always had to force compliance; they will not hesitate to continue doing so. Nevertheless, there are many concrete ways that individuals, groups, and neighborhoods can gut capitalism, which I will enumerate shortly. We must always keep in mind how we became slaves; then we can see more clearly how we can cease being slaves. We were forced into wage-slavery because the ruling class slowly, systematically, and brutally destroyed our ability to live autonomously. By driving us off the land, changing the property laws, destroying community rights, destroying our tools, imposing taxes, destroying our local markets, and so forth, we were forced onto the labor market in order to survive, our only remaining option being to sell, for a wage, our ability to work. It’s quite clear then how we can overthrow slavery. We must reverse this process. We must begin to reacquire the ability to live without working for a wage or buying the products made by wage-slaves (that is, we must get free from the labor market and the way of living based on it), and embed ourselves instead in cooperative labor and cooperatively produced goods. Another clarification is needed. This strategy does not call for reforming capitalism, for changing capitalism into something else. It calls for replacing capitalism, totally, with a new civilization. This is an important distinction, because capitalism has proved impervious to reforms, as a system. We can sometimes in some places win certain concessions from it (usually only temporary ones) and win some (usually short-lived) improvements in our lives as its victims, but we cannot reform it piecemeal, as a system. Thus our strategy of gutting and eventually destroying capitalism requires at a minimum a totalizing image, an awareness that we are attacking an entire way of life and replacing it with another, and not merely reforming one way of life into something else. Many people may not be accustomed to thinking about entire systems and social orders, but everyone knows what a lifestyle is, or a way of life, and that is the way we should approach it. The thing is this: in order for capitalism to be destroyed millions and millions of people must be dissatisfied with their way of life. They must want something else and see certain existing things as obstacles to getting what they want. It is not useful to think of this as a new ideology. It is not merely a belief-system that is needed, like a religion, or like Marxism, or Anarchism. Rather it is a new prevailing vision, a dominant desire, an overriding need. What must exist is a pressing desire to live a certain way, and not to live another way. If this pressing desire were a desire to live free, to be autonomous, to live in democratically controlled communities, to participate in the self-regulating activities of a mature people, then capitalism could be destroyed. Otherwise we are doomed to perpetual slavery and possibly even to extinction.<br />

 <strong><span style="font-size: 19px;">Any new launches crush the ozone – status quo is sustainable</span></strong><br />

The global market for rocket launches may require more stringent regulation in order to prevent significant damage to Earth’s stratospheric ozone layer in the decades to come, according to a new study by researchers in California and Colorado. Future ozone losses from unregulated rocket launches will eventually exceed ozone losses due to chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which stimulated the 1987 Montreal Protocol banning ozone-depleting chemicals, said Martin Ross, chief study author from The Aerospace Corporation in Los Angeles. The study, which includes the University of Colorado at Boulder and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, provides a market analysis for estimating future ozone layer depletion based on the expected growth of the space industry and known impacts of rocket launches. The paper by Ross, Manfred Peinemann of The Aerospace Corporation, CU-Boulder’s Darin Toohey and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s Patrick Ross appeared online in March in the journal Astropolitics. “If left unregulated, rocket launches by the year 2050 could result in more ozone destruction than was ever realized by CFCs. ”—Darin Toohey Solid rocket motors (SRMs) and liquid rocket engines (LREs) deplete the global ozone layer in various capacities. Highly reactive trace-gas molecules known as radicals dominate stratospheric ozone destruction, and a single radical in the stratosphere can destroy up to 10,000 ozone molecules before being deactivated and removed from the stratosphere. Microscopic particles, including soot and aluminum oxide particles emitted by rocket engines, provide chemically active surface areas that increase the rate such radicals leak from their reservoirs and contribute to ozone destruction. In addition, every type of rocket engine causes some ozone loss, and rocket combustion products are the only human sources of ozone-destroying compounds injected directly into the middle and upper stratosphere where the ozone layer resides. The authors estimated global ozone depletion from rockets as a function of payload launch rate and relative mix of SRM and LRE rocket emissions. Currently, global rocket launches deplete the ozone layer ~0. 03%, an insignificant fraction of the depletion caused by other ozone depletion substances (ODSs). However, they note, as the space industry grows and ODSs fade from the stratosphere, ozone depletion from rockets could become significant.<br />

The ozone layer is essential for human life. It is able to absorb much harmful ultraviolet radiation, preventing penetration to the earths surface. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is defined as radiation with wavelengths between 290-320 nanometers, which are harmful to life because this radiation can enter cells and destroy the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of many life forms on planet earth. In a sense, the ozone layer can be thought of as a UV filter or our planets built in sunscreen (Geocities. com, 1998). Without the ozone layer, UV radiation would not be filtered as it reached the surface of the earth. If this happened, cancer would break out and all of the living civilizations, and all species on earth would be in jeopardy (Geocities. com, 1998). Thus, the ozone layer essentially allows life, as we know it, to exist<br />

While it has been suggested that in the long term, space solar power (SSP) can provide all the clean, renewable energy Earth could possibly need (and then some), there has been less discussion on the most economic way to produce that power. If we want to build two or three solar power satellites, one obvious approach is to manufacture the parts on the ground, launch them into orbit, and assemble them there, just like the International Space Station. But a few power satellites won’t solve our energy or greenhouse gas problems. We’ll need more. To generate all the energy used on Earth today (about 15 terawatts) would require roughly 400 solar power satellites 10 kilometers across. Assuming advanced, lightweight space solar power technology, this will require at least 100,000 launches to bring all the materials up from Earth. But even 400 satellites won’t be enough.<br />

 <strong><span style="font-size: 19px;">The aff’s portrayal of China as a knowable object and a threat to the United States legitimates otherizing power politics which transforms our conceptions of China into a social reality</span></strong><br />
Pan, 2004 [Lecturer in International Relations, School of International and Political Studies at Deakin University (Chengxin, “The &quot;China Threat&quot; in American Self-Imagination”, Alternatives 29 (2004), 305-331, Galileo) Chetan<br />
<br />
China and its relationship with the United States has long been a fascinating subject of study in the mainstream U. S. international relations community. This is reflected, for example, in the current heated debates over whether China is primarily a strategic threat to or a market bonanza for the United States and whether containment or engagement is the best way to deal with it. * While U. S. China scholars argue fiercely over &quot;what China precisely is,&quot; their debates have been underpinned by some common ground, especially in terms of a positivist epistemology. Firstly, they believe that China is ultimately a knowable object, whose reality can be, and ought to be, empirically revealed by scientific means. For example, after expressing his dissatisfaction with often conflicting Western perceptions of China, David M. Lampton, former president of the National Committee on U. S. -China Relations, suggests that &quot;it is time to step back and look at where China is today, where it might be going, and what consequences that direction will hold for the rest of the world. &quot;2 Like many other China scholars, Lampton views his object of study as essentially &quot;something we can stand back from and observe with clinical detachment. &quot;^ Secondly, associated with the first assumption, it is commonly believed that China scholars merely serve as &quot;disinterested observers&quot; and that their studies of China are neutral, passive descriptions of reality. And thirdly, in pondering whether China poses a threat or offers an opportunity to the United States, they rarely raise the question of &quot;what the United States is. &quot; That is, the meaning of the United States is believed to be certain and beyond doubt. I do not dismiss altogether the conventional ways of debating China. It is not the purpose of this article to venture my own &quot;observation&quot; of &quot;where China is today,&quot; nor to join the &quot;containment&quot; versus &quot;engagement&quot; debate per se. Rather, I want to contribute to a novel dimension of the China debate by questioning the seemingly unproblematic assumptions shared by most China scholars in the mainstream IR community in the United States. To perform this task, I will focus attention on a particularly significant component of the China debate; namely, the &quot;China threat&quot; literature. More specifically, I want to argue that U. S. conceptions of China as a threatening other are always intrinsically linked to how U. S. policymakers/mainstream China specialists see themselves (as representatives of the indispensable, security-conscious nation, for example). As such, they are not value-free, objective descriptions of an independent, preexisting Chinese reality out there, but are better understood as a kind of normative, meaning-giving practice that often legitimates power politics in U. S. -China relations and helps transform the &quot;China threat&quot; into social reality. In other words, it is self-fulfilling in practice, and is always part of the &quot;China threat&quot; problem it purports merely to describe. In doing so, I seek to bring to the fore two interconnected themes of self/other constructions and of theory as practice inherent in the &quot;China threat&quot; literature—themes that have been overridden and rendered largely invisible by those common positivist assumptions. These themes are of course nothing new nor peculiar to the &quot;China threat&quot; literature. They have been identified elsewhere by critics of some conventional fields of study such as ethnography, anthropology, oriental studies, political science, and international relations. * Yet, so far, the China field in the West in general and the U. S. &quot;China threat&quot; literature in particular have shown remarkable resistance to systematic critical refiection on both their normative status as discursive practice and their enormous practical implications for international politics. ^ It is in this context that this article seeks to make a contribution.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 19px;">Representations form the foundation of our relationship with China – the symbols and images advanced by the 1ac are more influential than official, state to state interactions</span></strong><br />
<strong>Liss, 2003</strong> MA Student in Asian Studies at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University (Alexander, “Images of China in the American Print Media: a survey from 2000 to 2002”, Journal of Contemporary China, May2003, Vol. 12 Issue 35, p299, 20p)<br />
<br />
The relationship between the United States and China works on many levels and involves many actors. The phrase ‘Sino–US relations’ usually brings to mind an image of interaction between the governments of each country. Yet, if we merely examine the diplomacy between the two countries, then we are left with an incomplete picture of the forces that affect how the nations engage each other. A key element to consider is the relationship between the two societies. Popular opinion and popular perceptions of each culture in the eyes of the other are far more subtle elements to consider, yet they are no less important than the official acts of government, and indeed, may even be more so. Analyzing these cultural perceptions is a complex task. Neither the culture that is perceived nor the one that does the observing is a static, unchanging entity. Looking at American perceptions of China is a difficult task that requires considerable leeway in our definitions of ‘America’ as well as of ‘China’. Therefore, we must look through a broad medium, such as newspapers, if we are to observe how China is portrayed to the average American. Newspapers reach tens of millions of Americans every day. They are widely considered a trusted and credible source of information concerning topics that may be touched upon only briefly on television or radio. Some of the biggest ones in the US have national distribution, and a wide and deep impact on the minds of their readers that cannot be underestimated. It only stands to reason that the way in which these major newspapers portray a certain topic, or a certain country (like China), can have a profound effect on the forces that shape interaction between two societies and the international relations between two countries.<br />
