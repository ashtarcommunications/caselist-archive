=T - Commercial= 

==1NC== 

**A) Interpretation - Exploration is space science and development is the creation of commercial market activities**
**Hsu and Cox, 9 -** *Senior fellow, Aerospace Technology Working Group, AND **Founder & Director of the Aerospace Technology Working Group (Feng and Ken, “Sustainable Space Exploration and Space Development - A Unified Strategic Vision,” 2/20, [[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=30702]])**

**Particularly, NASA needs reforms on the distribution … …need to be invested in solely by taxpayer contributions.**

B) Violation**- The affirmative must directly support private investment in space technology or infrastructure**

C) Voter**
1. Limits- This topic is massive if the resolution is interpreted to mean “do anything in space”, by forcing the aff to be profit-driven it means we don’t have to be prepared for the thousands of “test runs”, “tech demos”, or military affirmatives that would be otherwise topical

2. Ground – It’s impossible for us to come up with case-specific DAs to affirmatives that aren’t directed towards a profit incentive as we are not able to contest the cost-effectiveness of long-term plans or of tech-demos, debate would just devolve into generic spending and ptx links instead of plan specific research and education

=Vagueness - vs Nanotech= 

==1NC== 

**A. Interpretation – Necessary means “requisite”**
**Dictionary.com no date**
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(<span style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">[[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/necessary]]</span>, dml)</span>

__being essential__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, indispensable, </span>__or requisite__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: a necessary part of the motor </span>

**B. The affirmative does not indicate what systems the nanotechnology is used on or how it is used**

**This is a voting issue –**

**First, __ground__ – absent stable specification of what the aff actually does we can’t get links to their mechanism – moots the case debate and kills argument quality**

**Second, __solvency__ – they do not provide __military doctrine__ indicating nanotechnology is __requisite__ to anything beyond the Earth’s mesosphere – absent this you should presume negative because they don’t mandate an increase**

==2NC Overview== 

**Here’s evidence supporting our position – nanotechnology refers to __capabilities__ – not __specific technologies__ – they should have to specify __what kind__ of nanotech they develop – their author**
**Jenkins 9** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Eva S.—Lt Col, USAF, Ph.D, career intelligence officer, Air Force instructor, and a European, Eurasian, and NATO area specialist, served on the Joint Staff Directorate of Intelligence staff, on the Defense Intelligence Agency Director’s Special Projects staff, and as a National Security Agency Director’s Fellow, received her Ph.D in international studies, “NANOTECHNOLOGY – ENABLING FUTURE SPACE VIABILITY”, March 18th, dml)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nano is the Greek word for dwarf and technically equates to one billionth. 33 One nanometer (nm) is one-billionth of a meter or, in more easily understood terms, one nanometer is 10,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. </span>__There are several different meanings to the concept of nanotechnology__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> but two are most prevalent. The first “is a broad, stretched version meaning any technology dealing with something less than 100 nanometers in size.” The second is closer to the original definition “designing and building machines in which every atom and chemical bond is specified precisely.” 34 Put another way, </span>__nanotechnology is “specifically the technology we predict when the tide of technological progress washes against the shore of atomic physics__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (the quantum mechanics of electrons, with nuclei considered as unchangeable, primitive particles).” “</span>__Nanotechnology is **not a set of particular** **techniques**, devices, or products. It is, rather, **the set of capabilities that we will have** when our technology gets near the limits set by atomic physics.”__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 35 In simplest terms, </span>__nanotechnology consists of: “research and technology development__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the 1- to- 100nm size; </span>__creating and using structures that have novel properties because of their small size__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; and the ability to control or manipulate at the atomic scale.” 36 Nanotechnology’s appeal is that “unusual physical, chemical, and biological properties can emerge in materials at the nanoscale. These properties may differ in important ways from the properties of bulk materials and single atoms or molecules.” 37 There are many consumer products already out in the market that have capitalized on nanotechnology. </span>

==2NC Solvency== 

**They can’t solve – “necessary” means “requisite” which implies that their increase is conditioned upon a __demand__ for nanotechnology – the 1AC did not provide any evidence indicating that this demand exists which means you vote neg on presumption because it should be their burden to prove that the aff is inherent**

**And, if they do provide this evidence you vote neg – there is tech being developed in the status quo – it would be provided by NASA**
**Jenkins 9** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Eva S.—Lt Col, USAF, Ph.D, career intelligence officer, Air Force instructor, and a European, Eurasian, and NATO area specialist, served on the Joint Staff Directorate of Intelligence staff, on the Defense Intelligence Agency Director’s Special Projects staff, and as a National Security Agency Director’s Fellow, received her Ph.D in international studies, “NANOTECHNOLOGY – ENABLING FUTURE SPACE VIABILITY”, March 18th, dml)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In 2004 </span>__NASA was reportedly “spending more than $40 million a year on nanotechnology investigations__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” 59 </span>__The Center for Nanotechnology at NASA Ames is researching the application of nanotechnology__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “to reduce the mass, volume, and power consumption of a wide range of spacecraft systems including sensors, communications, navigation, and propulsion systems.” 60 </span>__The Johnson Space Center Nano Materials Project is working on nanotube composites to reduce the weight of spacecrafts__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**B. Violation – they said in cross-x that there is no distinction between humans, cyborgs, and technology – this means that they do not do anything different from the status quo**

__Among the priorities supported in the NASA budget proposal... ...__<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> for the program last year without success. </span>

**Voting issue for two reasons –**

**FIRST is ground – there is no __functional__ difference between the aff and the status quo –<span class="Underline"> ALL link arguments are terminally nonunique because the aff’s policy is the status quo – they should have to be inherent because ALL negative arguments and research strategies are premised on an affirmative change</span>**

<span class="Underline">**SECOND is extra-t – the only part of their aff that’s inherent is the mindset shift – that’s not an increase in space exploration or development, it’s a change in political methodology – voting issue because they can advocate any ethical shift in policy that’s unpredictable – makes it impossible to garner ground – also proves the resolution insufficient, vote neg on presumption**</span>


==2NC AT: We Meet== 

**The vagueness of the term “cyborg” means you should assume the __broadest possible definition__ – they said in cross-x that the cyborg was the “organic body polluted by technology”, that functionally extends to __anyone and everyone__, including those participating in space travel now – no existential inherency**
