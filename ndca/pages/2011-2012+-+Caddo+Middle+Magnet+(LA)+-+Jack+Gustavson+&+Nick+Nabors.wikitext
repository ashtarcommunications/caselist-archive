**Life is an art, its only value is aesthetic. Life, in allits excess, is beautiful. The only life worth living is a reckless, amoral,joyous one. Moralism denies the beauty of life by attempting to abolish all ofits excesses. Life is intrinsically amoral, thus, the desire to abolish excessand confine it within moral boundaries is both futile and the worst, mostdangerous of errors. Life no longer has any meaning and becomes something to beabolished. The unbearable pain that life itself now causes us is the only trueform of suffering. No matter what they change, no matter what action they take,life still remain something Evil, to be destroyed and cast into the abyss.
