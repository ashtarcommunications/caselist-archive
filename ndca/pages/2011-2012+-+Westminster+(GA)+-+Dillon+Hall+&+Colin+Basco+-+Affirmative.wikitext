A few weeks ago, Tobias [[http://futurismic.com/2007/09/26/military-and-eco-technology/|posted]] about the US military and eco-technology. In it, he jokingly suggested an eco-DARPA. As it turns out, the military seems headed in that direction, specifically with a [[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/solar101107.xml&headline=NSSO%20Backs%20Space%20Solar%20Power%20&channel=space|space-based solar power station]] that would beam energy down to the surface.

**No technological barriers, operational power in 2 years, neg authors mishandle the facts.**
**Ashworth ‘08 -** Fellow of the British Interplanetary Society (Stephen, The Space Review, “In defense of the knights”, 6/23, http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1153/1)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Usually, Day’s articles are among the best-written and most informative space commentary on the market. But this time he appears to have made a number of unjustified assertions.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">He writes: “Space activists, who are motivated by the desire to personally live and work in space, do not care about SSP per se […] they have latched on to SSP because it is expedient.” There may well exist people who answer to this description, but if so, they must be remarkably shortsighted. The facts are clear: fossil fuels have served civilization well in the first phase of its industrialization (approximately 1700–2000), but possess a number of problems, of which the current climate hysteria is only one; the others concern the long-term sustainability and growth of industrial energy consumption. Therefore we can predict an imminent shift of the baseload energy supply away from fossil fuels to, most likely, a mixture of artificial nuclear fission and fusion, and terrestrial and space-based solar power.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">I should add that my personal chances of ever living and working in space are zero. My concern is that society should make the best strategic choices for its prosperity and growth. Given the fact that almost all the natural resources of the universe of potential economic value are extraterrestrial, I am therefore bound to argue the importance of systematic access to those resources.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">SSP is not merely expedient, rather it is strategic, in the sense that it has the potential to permanently raise the whole of human civilization to a higher level of prosperity, security and spatial range. According to Day’s reading of the NSSO study, this is not for us, but only apparently for future generations, many decades in the future: “The NSSO study […] states that we are nowhere near developing practical SSP […] that the technology to implement space solar power does not currently exist… and is unlikely to exist for the next forty years.”</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This came as news to me.</span> … and in many cases accelerating.” (p.20)
This sounds promising. Does it mean we’ll be able to start work in forty years time?
“FINDING: __The SBSP Study …__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">can be found in Appendix B.” (p.22–23)</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Turning to Appendix B, we find that its introductory paragraphs point out that significant technological progress has been achieved in the past decade, which would allow an accelerated pace of progress compared with that proposed by NASA in the late 1990s. But Day is not impressed, for his article reads: “from a technological standpoint, we are not much closer to space solar power today than we were when NASA conducted a big study of it in the 1970s.” He seems to have been reading a completely different report.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Appendix B is subheaded: “AN AGGRESSIVE … </span>__of the NSSO study report.__

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">A consideration of costs has … </span>__<span style="color: black;">spread over multiple SPS lifespans.</span>__<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">’’</span>

**<span style="color: black;">Now is the ideal time for SPS – costs have dropped and new technology makes it more profitable than ever</span>**
**<span style="color: black;">McLinko, 10 </span>**<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">- SM Candidate (2011), Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Space Systems Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (April 2010, Ryan M., Society of Photo-optical Instrumentation Engineers, “Space-based Solar Power Generation Using a Distributed Network of Satellites and Methods for Efficient Space Power Transmission,” http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/57581)RK</span>

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">9. CONCLUSION</span>
__<span style="color: black;">The overall efficiency of this distributed satellite array of collectors, beamers and sub-beamers is 49%, but the overall return on investment is much higher as modularity allows one to put in a large swarm of low-cost satellites in orbit to generate a higher power output.</span>__
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">The breakdown of cost from a campaign perspective can be seen in Figure 4.</span>
__<span style="color: black;">Given recent advances in microwave beaming and DC to microwave conversion and vice versa at high efficiency rates, falling launch cost for satellites, and the operational robustness of the distributed architecture of solar power satellites proposed here, the time has come to phase out our dependence on fossil fuels and incorporate SSP power into Earth’s electrical grids.</span>__
