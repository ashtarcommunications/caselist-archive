 The War on terror has blurred the distinction between intelligence gathering and law enforcement calcifying the FBI and CIA into one locus of control <br />

<u>Modern transnational threats are placing great stress on the jurisdictional lines drawn between intelligence and law enforcement agencies. More to the point, <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">the foreign/domestic divide is oftentimes a distinction without a difference </span>in the fight against terrorism and other transboundary threats.</u> <u>This causes ambiguities in the &quot;handoff and, in some areas, the division of labor between the FBI and CIA in both the domestic and foreign realms</u>. It is conventional wisdom that previous distinctions between &quot;foreign&quot; and &quot;domestic&quot; are archaic and counterproductive when addressing modern national security threats.147 <u>This creates overlap between the interests of foreign intelligence collection and domestic law enforcement. &quot;The principal targets of intelligence concern are no longer just political and economic developments abroad that impinge on American national interests, but terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and drug-trafficking, all of which have domestic law enforcement ramification</u>s.&quot;148 There is also some tension in the cooperation between the CIA and the intelligence arm of the FBI. <u>The Bureau's efforts to reexamine its traditional division of labor with the CIA regarding management of intelligence sources abroad and foreign intelligence- gathering within the United States have been a source of friction between the 149 two agencie</u>s. Over time, <u>the U.S. has enacted &quot;long arm&quot; statutes that extend the FBI's investigative authority overseas and give the FBI worldwide jurisdiction over terrorist incidents directed at U.S. interests</u>.150 <u>The FBI's presence abroad has steadily increased as FBI personnel work in U.S. embassies, interact and cooperate directly with foreign law enforcement agencies</u>, and often <u>take lead roles in overseas investigations of terrorist activities directed against United States interests</u>.151 <u>FBI activity has increased outward while there has been no corresponding shift of CIA responsibility inward</u>. That is to say, <u>the rhetorical breakdown between the foreign and domestic spheres is recognized as a two- way street but for the most part only has traffic heading in one direction</u>. Problems in the intelligence mission of the FBI received great scrutiny following September II,152 and numerous policy proposals were floated, including the creation of a domestic intelligence agency that would entirely subsume the FBI's intelligence functions.153 <u>Ultimately, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act chose to continue the basic jurisdictional breakdown between the nation's intelligence community (including the existing domestic/foreign division of labor between the CIA and FBI) while seeking to improve the FBI's intelligence capabilities and, more broadly, information sharing among intelligence and law enforcement agencies</u>.154 <u>Continuation of the present course will mean closer cooperation between the CIA and FBI law enforcement officials abroad on issues of interest to both the intelligence and law enforcement communities and increased sharing of information between CIA and FBI intelligence and law enforcement officials at home.</u>155 <u>The closer this cooperation becomes, the greater the risk of running afoul of the categorical prohibitions of CIA activity laid out in the National Security Ac</u>t. The modern national security environment - and the U.S. strategy as a result call for an overlap and flexibility of approach and a level of cooperation that is impeded by the CIA mandate. <u>For that reason, the contours of CIA activity domestically and internationally - be they in cooperation with FBI officials abroad that approach law enforcement activities or dissemination of intelligence on terrorist cells operating in the United States that could approach internal security or law enforcement functions should be based on an explicit national conversation rather than the statutory legacy of a bygone era.</u> <br />

Smail Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Global Research, November 16, 2009, Tom Dispatch - 2009-11-12, “Welcome Home, War!

<span class="Underline">In his approach to National Security Agency surveillance, as well as CIA renditions, drone assassinations, and military detention, President Obama has to a surprising extent embraced the expanded executive powers championed by his conservative predecessor, George W. Bush. This bipartisan affirmation of the imperial executive could &quot;reverberate for generations,&quot; warns Jack Balkin, a specialist on First Amendment freedoms at Yale Law School. And consider these but some of the early fruits from the hybrid seeds that the Global War on Terror has planted on American soil. Yet surprisingly few Americans seem aware of the toll that this already endless war has taken on our <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">civil liberties</span></strong>. Don't be too surprised, then, when, in the midst of some future crisis, <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">advanced surveillance methods</span> and other techniques developed in our recent <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">counterinsurgency wars</span> migrate from Baghdad, Falluja, and Kandahar to your hometown or urban neighborhood. And don't ever claim that nobody told you this could happen -- at least not if you care to read on. <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Think of our counterinsurgency wars abroad as so many <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">living laboratories</span> for the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">undermining of a democratic society</span></span></strong> at home, a process historians of such American wars can tell you has been going on for a long, long time. Counterintelligence innovations like centralized data, covert penetration, and disinformation developed during the Army's first protracted pacification campaign in a foreign land -- the Philippines from 1898 to 1913 -- were repatriated to the United States during World War I, becoming the blueprint for an invasive internal security apparatus that persisted for the next half century. Almost 90 years later, George W. Bush's Global War on Terror plunged the U.S. military into four simultaneous counterinsurgency campaigns, large and small -- in Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and (once again) the Philippines -- transforming a vast swath of the planet into an ad hoc&quot; counterterrorism&quot; laboratory. The result? Cutting-edge high-tech security and counterterror techniques that are now <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">slowly migrating homeward. </span>As the War on Terror enters its ninth year to become one of America's longest overseas conflicts, the time has come to ask an uncomfortable question: What impact have the wars in <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Afghanistan and Iraq</span></strong> -- and the atmosphere they created domestically -- had on the quality of our democracy? Every American knows that we are supposedly fighting elsewhere to defend democracy here at home. Yet the crusade for democracy abroad, largely unsuccessful in its own right, has proven remarkably effective in building a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">technological template</span> that could be just a few <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">tweaks </span>away from creating a domestic surveillance state -- with omnipresent cameras, deep data-mining, nano-second biometric identification, and drone aircraft patrolling &quot;the homeland.&quot; Even if its name is increasingly anathema in Washington, the ongoing Global War on Terror has helped bring about a massive expansion of domestic surveillance by the FBI and the National Security Agency (NSA) whose combined data-mining systems have already swept up several billion private documents from U.S. citizens into classified data banks. Abroad, after years of failing counterinsurgency efforts in the Middle East, the Pentagon began applying biometrics -- the science of identification via facial shape, fingerprints, and retinal or iris patterns -- to the pacification of Iraqi cities, as well as the use of electronic intercepts for instant intelligence and the split-second application of satellite imagery to aid an assassination campaign by drone aircraft that reaches from Africa to South Asia. In the panicky aftermath of some future terrorist attack, Washington could quickly fuse existing foreign and domestic surveillance techniques, as well as others now <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">being developed</span></span></strong> on distant battlefields, to create an instant digital surveillance state.</span><br />
This collusion between the CIA and FBI is particularly dangerous in this instance<br />

Nextgov 3/15 [ News and commentary on the management of information technology in the U.S. federal government, William Mathews, New FBI system to use hands, faces, irises, in addition to 70 million fingerprints to ID suspects 03/15/2011 ] hn<br />
If you get stopped by the police in Houston, it will take them just 16 seconds to compare your fingerprints to the 2 million that are in a database of terrorists, sex offenders, criminals with outstanding arrest warrants and others. <u>The Repository for Individuals of Special Concern system is part of the FBI's new nationwide Next-Generation Identification system that eventually will employ a host of new technologies to more quickly and accurately identify criminal suspects</u>. &quot;Most criminals don't carry IDs, or if they do, they're fake IDs,&quot; said John Traxler, <u>NGI program manager at the FBI's criminal justice information services division.</u> <u>The new identification system enables police officers to use a handheld fingerprint reader to send prints through a squad car's radio to the FBI's database and learn almost instantly whether there is a match</u>. If not, don't relax yet. Your prints also can be compared to 70 million stored in a much larger database. That will take about 30 minutes. For <u>now, the NGI system, which began operating Feb. 25, handles fingerprints only</u>. <u>But during the next several years, new biometric capabilities will be added to make identification possible through facial recognition technology, iris patterns, and digital photographs of scars, tattoos and other physical markings.</u> <u>The $1.2 billion program replaces the 12-year-old Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System, which was built to process 62,000 daily requests for fingerprint comparisons</u>. <u>But as security nationwide has tightened since the Sept, 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the demand for fingerprint checks from law enforcement agencies has multiplied to more than 200,000 a day</u>, Traxler said. &quot;<u>The FBI recognized that it needed to build a follow-on system that was bigger, faster, stronger and more open to new technology,</u>&quot; said Art Ibers, NGI program director at Lockheed Martin Corp., which built the new system. <u>When fully installed, NGI will be able to process 900,000 identification requests a day, he said. The key to the new system is an advanced algorithm for analyzing and comparing fingerprints.</u> &quot;<u>Fingerprints contain a number of minutia</u>,&quot; or tiny features such as ridges, furrows, loops and swirls. <u>The algorithm analyzes these and builds an index for each print, Ibers said</u>. When a new fingerprint arrives for comparison, an index is made and then compared to the others in the database. The <u>old system was able to make an accurate match about 92 percent of the time if there was a matching fingerprint in the database, Ibers said</u>. N<u>GI increases that accuracy to 99.6 percen</u>t, Traxler said. <u>In addition to speeding up the processing of fingerprints, NGI is scheduled to add automated comparison of palm prints and latent fingerprints</u> -- <u>those left on surfaces and recoverable at crime scenes -- to its repertoire next</u> year. <u>The improvements are aimed at helping police solve crimes</u>. <u>Many of the prints found at crime scenes are palm prints</u>, Traxler said<u>. At present, there is no way to conduct an automated search that compares palm prints or latent prints with databases, he said. The search algorithm to do that will be different because the prints often are poor quality, thus harder to compare</u>. For now, it's a time-consuming, manual process. <u>Facial recognition and automated comparisons of scars and body markings capabilities are expected to be added to the system in 2013.</u> Initially, facial recognition capability will be limited to two-dimensional photos, such as mug shots and driver's license photos, Traxler said. <u>The ability to accurately make matches from those images has improved substantially in the past two years, he said</u>. <u>More complex facial-recognition technology using video and three-dimensional images is not yet reliable enough to consider for the NGI system, he</u> said. <u>Also in 2013, the FBI is expected to begin experimenting with iris recognition.</u> <u>Although not widely used in the United States, identification through iris patterns is catching on overseas</u>. In part, it's attractive &quot;because no contact is required, you just take a picture,&quot; Traxler said. In some cultures there is substantial resistance to having fingerprints taken. <u>The NGI system is expected to serve more than 18,000 U.S. law enforcement agencies and to provide print matching services to the Defense and Homeland Security departments.</u> <u>The prospect of a massive new multitechnology identification database has caused concern among some privacy advocates.</u> The Electronic Privacy Information Center warned that the new system will greatly expand the amount and types of information collected and maintained about people in government databases and biometric data is not always accurate<u>.</u> Increased data collection &quot;is always something to be concerned about,&quot; agreed Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute. Harper said he is concerned &quot;about the collection policies&quot; the FBI will use to determine when information will be gathered what information will be stored in the database. If the NGI system is used to check the identification of &quot;genuine suspects, then it's appropriate.&quot; And if the new system does a faster and more accurate job of making identifications, that's good, he said. Traxler said using multiple identifiers -- fingerprints, facial recognition, body markings and eventually irises -- &quot;is about making identification more positive.&quot; <br />

The end result is the utilization of military intelligence as the primary means for all FBI policing to the point that all life comes under the gaze of homeland security <br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">McCoy 9</span></strong> [Alfred W. McCoy, J.R.W. Smail Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Global Research, November 16, 2009, Tom Dispatch - 2009-11-12, “Welcome Home, War! Creating the &quot;Domestic Surveillance State&quot; How America's Wars Are Systematically Destroying Our Liberties”]</span><br />
<span class="Underline">While U.S. combat forces prepare to draw-down in Iraq (and ramp up in Afghanistan), military intelligence units are coming home to apply their combat-tempered surveillance skills to our expanding homeland security state, while preparing to counter any future domestic civil disturbances here. Indeed, in September 2008, the Army's Northern Command announced that one of the Third Division's brigades in Iraq would be reassigned as a Consequence Management Response Force (CMRF) inside the U.S. Its new mission: planning for moments when civilian authorities may need help with &quot;civil unrest and crowd control.&quot; According to Colonel Roger Cloutier, his unit's civil-control equipment featured &quot;a new modular package of non-lethal capabilities&quot; designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals -- including Taser guns, roadblocks, shields, batons, and beanbag bullets. That same month, Army Chief of Staff General George Casey flew to Fort Stewart, Georgia, for the first full CMRF mission readiness exercise. There, he strode across a giant urban battle map filling a gymnasium floor like a conquering Gulliver looming over Lilliputian Americans. With 250 officers from all services participating, the military war-gamed its future coordination with the FBI, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and local authorities in the event of a domestic terrorist attack or threat. Within weeks, the American Civil Liberties Union filed an expedited freedom of information request for details of these deployments, arguing: &quot;[It] is imperative that the American people know the truth about this new and unprecedented intrusion of the military in domestic affairs.&quot; At the outset of the Global War on Terror in 2001, memories of early Cold War anti-communist witch-hunts blocked Bush administration plans to create a corps of civilian tipsters and potential vigilantes. However, far more sophisticated security methods, developed for counterinsurgency warfare overseas, are now coming home to far less public resistance. They promise, sooner or later, to further jeopardize the constitutional freedoms of Americans. In these same years, under the pressure of War on Terror rhetoric, presidential power has grown relentlessly, opening the way to unchecked electronic surveillance, the endless detention of terror suspects, and a variety of inhumane forms of interrogation. Somewhat more slowly, innovative techniques of biometric identification, aerial surveillance, and civil control are now being repatriated as well. In a future America, enhanced retinal recognition could be married to omnipresent security cameras as a part of the increasingly routine monitoring of public space. Military surveillance equipment, tempered to a technological cutting edge in counterinsurgency wars, might also one day be married to the swelling domestic databases of the NSA and FBI, sweeping the fiber-optic cables beneath our cities for any sign of subversion. And in the skies above, loitering aircraft and cruising drones could be checking our borders and peering down on American life. If that day comes, our cities will be Argus-eyed with countless thousands of digital cameras scanning the faces of passengers at airports, pedestrians on city streets, drivers on highways, ATM customers, mall shoppers, and visitors to any federal facility. One day, hyper-speed software will be able to match those millions upon millions of facial or retinal scans to photos of suspect subversives inside a biometric database akin to England's current National Public Order Intelligence Unit, sending anti-subversion SWAT teams scrambling for an arrest or an armed assault. By the time the Global War on Terror is declared over in 2020, if then, our American world may be unrecognizable -- or rather recognizable only as the stuff of dystopian science fiction. What we are proving today is that, however detached from the wars being fought in their name most Americans may seem, war itself never stays far from home for long. It's already returning in the form of new security technologies that could one day make a digital surveillance state a reality, changing fundamentally the character of American democracy.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Risk assessment is usually thought of as a rational, objective stratagem, a conscious weighing of probability and consequences. For Ulrich Beck (1992; 1999), it is the big risks—nuclear catastrophe, pollution and environmental degradation, etc.—that concern cosmopolitan subjects. Risks are also being individualized so that people develop lay perceptions about levels of risk for certain activities in specific areas of the city. For Kevin Haggerty, “elements of our social identities are formed through the risks we attend to and how we attenuate those risks” (2003: 207). Risks are measured by means of surveillance, and surveillance in turn meticulously detects risks of all sorts, creating new categories of suspicion. Risk classifications are the means by which authorities and professionals think, act and justify their actions (Rose 2000a: 198). As Michalis Lianos and Mary Douglas have put it, “risk has moved from periphery to center in the analysis of contemporary social conditions. Perceptions of danger have sharpened, and in particular it is social dangers which captivate and alarm the public” (2000: 103). Racialized status is a strong predicator of fear of crime, and these fears are falsely based on representations which link ethnocultural minorities with crime (Pain 2001: 906; Van Dijk 1991). At the same time, asymmetrical levels of surveillance, perceived as individual prejudice, are not merely the byproduct of racist stereotyping, but rather are “embedded in the classification schemes employed by the police and the risk institutions the police report to” (Ericson and Haggerty 1997: 282). National and/or racial groups may be imagined communities (Anderson 1991), but these distinctions must be implemented through classificatory schemes and administrative practices (Torpey 2000). Police and security authorities use codes to classify normality from abnormality, suspicious activity from non-suspicious activity. These codes are arranged along the lines of racialized exclusion and residential segregation, so that it is not only visible minorities who are construed as risks, but also the communities they live and work in. CCTV is a new technology transposed onto an old spatial economy which works to maintain racialized segregation in the city. While the technologies of surveillance might have changed since the 19th century, the motivations for its implementation have stayed the same since Bentham’s utilitarian passion for the panopticon: “Danger from our enemies, danger from those who might grow into our enemies…” (qtd. in Boyne 2000: 290). S<span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">urveillance is, and always has been, a means of social defense from imagined communities of risk. </span>The bodies of visible minorities become racialized images to be policed. A key difference: racial typographies have been responsibilized in accordance with new forms of urban governance. Risk management, defined as “the identification, assessment, elimination or reduction of the possibility of incurring misfortune or loss” (Rose 1999: 261), has fully permeated managerial and surveillance practices. These strategies are probabilistic in that they aim to structure or monitor “problematic zones” in the city to reduce the likelihood of undesirable events occurring. The emergence of these new control strategies in the city reconfigures the old paradigm of what was called “race relations.” Consistent with the critique levied earlier against the biometrics literature, risk management strategies are not cybernetic. In a precautionary and moralizing form, camera surveillance in the city irrationally focuses on the embodied individual, thereby locating the determinants of imagined criminogenic risk squarely within those individuals subsumed by the gaze. As a form of urban governance, open-street CCTV may seem technical rather than moral, actuarial rather than normative, but empirically it is all of this. In other words, whereas risk is usually associated with actuarialism (Feeley and Simon 1992), risk in action shows the discretionary power of risk workers (Walby 2005; Ballucci in submission). Racialized profiling is risk management, but in a hybridized normative, rather than the actuarial, sense. The introduction of risk management, sometimes aided by biometrics, introduces a technical, non-interactive tangent into the mix of city surveillance, but <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">skin colour continues to act as a signifier of suspicion for camera operators “on the ground</span>.” As risk is managed in secure zones, the perceived riskiness of other unmonitored zones is amplified (Rose 1999: 248) so that the proliferation of biometric risk management strategies harbours the potential to increase, rather than decrease, racialized risk perception and social antagonism based on racialization. At this point it is possible to assert a few supplements on issues of risk and profiling as they apply to discussions of open-street CCTV. First, uncertainty in city space—the perception of disorder—leads to the commodification of security measures, the proliferation of new “risk technologies” like CCTV and distanciated forms of ruling and surveillance, all located within the emergence of new urban security networks (Newburn 2001: 842). These networks disperse, rather than centralize, power; that any essentializing postulation which sees profiling as a black and white issue would be fundamentally misled about the nature of power and politics today. When it comes to resisting the securitization of city space, an essentialist position on social collectivities is not progressive. That minority member camera operators reproduce profiling outcomes suggests that acts of governance actually constitute the zones on which they act and the entities upon which they act (Rose 2000b: 1145). Racialized profiling is an organizational property of surveillance practices. Second, <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">it cannot be disputed that the dispersion of urban camera surveillance adheres to a class pattern, with CCTV acting as a technological defense mechanism against “persons of the street,” racialized Others, homeless and youth—persons construed</span> as TOPIA 16 | 62 <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">constituting risks to the general public who are in fact the most marginalized</span>. The nature of power has changed, but the distribution of poverty has not. Third, open-street CCTV detects risks televisually. Implementing CCTV depoliticizes the relationship between citizens and the law because citizens then perceive authorities as attending to the perception of urban disorder. CCTV bolsters a new penology in that it televisually detects more crime and “greatly assists with clearance rates in the downtown core.” 3 This perception fosters trust of expert systems and technology, rather than eroding that trust; citizen’s perceptions of urban risk decreases as police services take these derisory surveillance measures. If <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">racialization through surveillance is based on urban risk-management practices, we must ask if the nation-state and juridical system are the best political units for addressing the local problematic of social segregation</span>. As Warren Magnusson (2000: 294) points out, “notions of hierarchy, centricity, and systematicity, lead inexorably to the idea of sovereignty; that is, to the idea that there is a point from which the world can be (or is being) organized or ‘governed’.” Few ethnographic studies concerned with the processes of camera watching have been performed. Considering the prevalence of CCTV surveillance in city spaces across Europe and North America (Norris et al. 2004), ethnographic studies of CCTV control rooms should serve as an important site of sociological/criminological research in the future. Racialized bodies will not disappear from the city as long as what counts as suspicious is detected via the eye of the CCTV operator. </span><br />

<span style="color: black;"> <u>The struggle against racism will be long,</u> difficult, without intermission<u>, without remission, probably never achieved</u>. Yet for this very reason, <u>it is a struggle to be undertaken without surcease and without concessions.</u> One cannot be indulgent toward racism; one must not even let the monster in the house, especially not in a mask. To give it merely a foothold means to augment the bestial part in us and in other people, which is to diminish what is human. <u>To accept the racist universe to the slightest degree is to endorse fear, injustice and violence. It is to accept the persistence of the dark history in which we still largely live. It is to agree that the outsider will always be a possible victim</u> (and which [person] man is not [themself] himself an outsider relative to someone else?). Racism illustrates in sum, the inevitable negativity of the condition of the dominated; that is, it illuminates in a certain sense the entire human condition. <u>The anti-racist struggle, difficult though it is, and always in question, is nevertheless one of the prologues to the ultimate passage from animality to humanity. In that sense, we cannot fail to rise to the racist challenge</u></span><br />

<span class="Underline">As key figures in an administration that authorized algorithmic computing applications, biometrics, risk management systems and surveillance technologies to help fight the “war on terror”, their move to the private commercial world illustrates an emerging geography of securitization in everyday life. From the remote sensing of bodies on a railway platform, to the securing of identity via biometric algorithms, or the profiling of risk at the airport, the practices of the war on terror exceed any clear distinction between military/civil/commercial spheres. It is not that algorithmic techniques have their origins strictly in the military domain (though, as we will see, many of them do), nor that society is strictly undergoing renewed militarization, but that security practices oscillate back and forth across different domains. There is, as William Connolly describes it, an emerging “resonance” between security activities: Airport surveillance, internet filters, passport tracking devices, legal detention without criminal charges, security internment camps, secret trials, “free speech zones”, DNA profiles, border walls and fences, erosion of the line between internal security and external military action—these security activities resonate together, engendering a national security machine that pushes numerous issues outside the range of legitimate dissent and mobilizes the populace to support new security and surveillance practices against underspecified enemies (Connolly 2005:54). Neither a militarization of society, nor even a commercialization of security, then, what we are seeing is a stitching together of the mundane and prosaic calculations of business, the security decisions authorized by the state, and the mobilized vigilance of a fearful public. It is important to stress here that questioning the logic of militarization is not to underplay the acute violence inherent to this different kind of war. What I call here “algorithmic war” is one specific appearance of Foucault’s Clausewitzian inversion—the “continuation of war by other means”, its appeal to technology and expertise rendering the violent force of war somewhat ordinary and invisible (2003 [1976]:16). “The role of political power”, writes Foucault, “is perpetually to use a sort of silent war to reinscribe the relationship of force, and to reinscribe it in institutions, economic inequalities, language, and even the bodies of individuals” (16–17). Understood in this way, the political practices of homeland security—what Derek Gregory and Alan Pred call “expert solutions” (2007:1)—are actually sanctioning and reproducing the war-like relations of power seen in the overtly militarized spaces of Afghanistan and Iraq. They target individual bodies, designate communities as dangerous or risky, delineate safe zones from targeted locations, invoke the pre-emptive strike on the city streets.

It deploys an “architecture of enmity”, a drawing of the lines between self/other; us/them; safe/risky; inside/outside, that makes going to war possible (Shapiro 1997). Though political geography has given critical attention to the performativity of the violent imagination of threat, this has most commonly focused on spaces where the presence of war is visceral and visible—where uniformed military personnel are present on the city streets (Katz 2007); when urban spaces are the targeted sites of war (Graham 2004); or in the tangible violences of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay (Minca 2005). In this paper, I explore the less visible spaces where the architecture of enmity is present in the form of algorithmic war. In the first section, I trace an extended example of algorithmic calculations deployed to identify “hidden” associations between people, groups, behaviours and transactions. Initially developed to allow commercial retail players to take strategic decisions in an uncertain future marketplace, algorithmic “rules of association” have become the basis for pre-emptive state security decisions. In the second section, I focus on the spatiality of algorithmic war, arguing that it has a geography of locatability. Discussing the homeland security applications of radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies, I suggest that the dispersed and diffuse locations of the supply chain (offshore, export processing, control from a distance) are incorporated into state border controls (RFID passports and visas, tracking technologies in public space). Algorithmic war appears to make it possible for the imagination of an open global economy of mobile people, objects and monies, to be reconciled with the post-9/11 rendering of a securitized nation-state.</span><br />

Consider again the contrastive terms in which it is possible to view biopolitics and sovereignty. The final chapter in the first volume of the History of Sexuality that contrasts sovereignty and biopolitics is titled &quot;Right of Death and Power over Life.&quot; The initial terms of the contrast between the two registers of government is thus between one that could employ power to put subjects to death, even if this right to kill was conditioned by the defense of the sovereign, and one that was concerned with the fostering of life. Nevertheless, each part of the contrast can be further broken down. <u>The right of death can also be understood as &quot;the right to take life or let live&quot;</u>; the power over life as the power &quot;to foster life or disallow it. <u>Sovereign power is a power that distinguishes between political life</u> (Dios) <u>and mere existence or bare life</u> (zoe). <u>Bare life is included in the constitution of sovereign power by its very exclusion from political life.</u> In contrast, biopolitics might be thought to include zoe in bios: stripped down mere existence becomes a matter of political reality. Thus, <u>the contrast between biopolitics and sovereignty</u> is not one of a power of life versus a power of death but <u>concerns the way that different forms of power treat matters of life and death and entail different conceptions of life.</u> Thus, biopolitics reinscribes the earlier right of death and power over life and places it within a new and different form that attempts to include what had earlier been sacred and taboo, bare life, in political existence. <u>It is no longer so much the right</u> of the sovereign <u>to put to death leis-enemies but to disqualify the life-the mere existence-of those who are a threat to the life of the population, to disallow those deemed &quot;unworthy of life,&quot; those whose bare life is not worth living.</u> This allows us, first, to consider what might be thought of as <u>the dark side of biopolitics</u> (Foucault 1979a: 136-37). In FoucauIt's account, <u>biopolitics does not put an end to the practice of war: it provides war with new and more sophisticated killing machines.</u> These machines allow killing itself to be reposed at the level of entire populations. <u>Wars become genocidal in the twentieth century. The same state that takes on the duty to enhance the life of the population also exercises the power of death over whole populations. Atomic weapons are the key weapons of this proc</u>ess of power to put the whole populations to death. We might <u>also</u> consider here the aptly named <u>biological and chemical weapons that seek an extermination of populations by visiting plagues upon them or polluting the biosphere in which they live to the point at which bare life is no longer sustainable.</u> Nor does the birth of <u>biopolitics</u> put an end to the killing of one's own populations. Rather, it <u>intensifie</u>s that <u>killing</u>-<u>whether by an &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; that visits holocausts upon whole groups or by the mass slaughters of classes and groups <span style="color: #33cccc;">conducted</span> in the name of the utopia to be achieved.</u> There is a certain restraint in sovereign power. The right of death is only occasionally exercised as the right to kill and then often in a ritual fashion that suggests a relation to the sacred. More often, sovereign power is manifest in the refraining from the right to kill. <u>The biopolitical imperative knows know</u> such <u>restraint. Power is exercised at the level of populations and hence wars will be waged at that level, on behalf of everyone and their lives.</u> This point brings us to the heart of Foucault's provocative thesis about biopolitics: that <u>there is an intimate connection between the exercise of a life-administering power and the commission of genocide: &quot;If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill: it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large scale phenomenon of the population&quot;</u> (1979: 137). Foucault completes this same passage with an expression that deserves more notice: &quot;<u>massacres have become vital</u>.&quot; There is thus a kind of perverse homogeneity between the power over life and the power to take life characteristic of biopower. <u>The emergence of a biopolitical</u> racism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries can be approached as a trajectory in which this homogeneity always threatened to top over into a dreadful necessity. This racism can be approached as a fundamental mechanism of power that is inscribed in the biopolitical domain (Stoler 1995: 84-85). For Foucault, the <u>primary function of this form of racism is to establish a division between those who must live and those who must die, and to distinguish the superior from the inferior, the fit from the unfit</u>. The notion and techniques of population had given rise, at the end of the nineteenth century, to a new linkage among population, the internal organization of states, and the competition between states. Darwinism, as an imperial social program, would plot the ranking of individuals, populations, and nations along the common gradient of fitness and thus measure efficiency. However, the series &quot;population, evolution, and race&quot; is not simply a way of thinking about the superiority of the &quot;white races&quot; or of justifying colonialism, but also of thinking about how to treat the degenerates and abnormals in one's own population and prevent further degeneration of the race. The second and most important function for Foucault of this biopolitical racism in the nineteenth century is that &quot;it establishes a positive relation between the right to kill and the assurance of life&quot; (Stoler 1995: 84). The life of the population, its vigor, its health, its capacities to survive becomes necessarily linked to the elimination of internal and external threats. This power to disallow life is perhaps best encapsulated in the injunction of the eugenic project: to identify those who are degenerate, abnormal, feeble-minded, or of an inferior race and subject them to force sterilization; encourage those who are superior, fit, intelligent to propagate. Identify those whose life is but mere existence and disqualify their propagation; encourage those who can partake of a sovereign existence and of a moral and political life. But this last example does not necessarily establish a positive justification for the right to kill, only the right to disallow life. If we are to begin to understand the type of racism engaged in by Nazism, however, we need to take into account another kind of denouement between the biopolitical management of population and the exercise of sovereignty. This version of sovereignty is no longer the transformed and democratized form founded on the liberty of the juridical subject, as it is for liberalism, but a sovereignty that takes up and transforms a further element of sovereignty, its &quot;symbolics of blood&quot; (Foucault 1979: 148). For Foucault, sovereignty is grounded in blood-as a reality and as a symbol-just as one might say that sexuality becomes the key field on which biopolitical management of populations is articulated. When power is exercised through repression and deduction, through a law over which hangs the sword, when it is exercised on the scaffold by the torturer and the executioner, and when relations between households and families were forged through alliance, &quot;blood was a reality with a symbolic function.&quot; By contrast, for biopolitics with its themes of health, vigorm fitness, vitality, progeny, survival, and race, &quot;power spoke of sexuality to sexuality&quot; (Foucault 1979a: 147).For Foucault (1979a: 149-50), the novelty of National Socialism was the way it articulated &quot;the oneiric exaltation of blood,&quot; of fatherland, and of the triumph of the race in an immensely cynical and naive fashion, with the paroxysms of a disciplinary and biopolitical power concerned with the detailed administration of the life of the population and the regulation of sexuality, family, marriage, and education. Nazism generalized biopower without the limit-critique posed by the juridical subject of right, but it could not do away with sovereignty. Instead, it established a set of permanent interventions into the conduct of the individual within the population and articulated this with the &quot;mythical concern for blood and the triumph of the race.&quot; Thus, the shepherd-flock game and the city-citizen game are transmuted into the eugenic ordering of biological existence (of mere living and subsistence) and articulated on the themes of the purity of blood and the myth of the fatherland. In such an articulation of these elements of sovereign and biopolitical forms of power, <u>the relation between the administration of life and the right to kill entire populations</u> is no longer simply one of a dreadful homogeneity. It <u>has become a necessary relation. The administration of life comes to require a bloodbath. It is not simply that power,</u> and therefore war, <u>will be exercised at the level of an entire population. It is that the act of disqualifying the right to life of other races becomes necessary for the fostering of the life of the race.</u> Moreover, <u>the elimination of other races is only once face of the purification of one's own race</u> (Foucault 1997b: 231). The other part is <u>to expose the latter to a universal and absolute danger, to expose it to the risk of death and total destruction.</u> For Foucault, with the Nazi state we have an &quot;absolutely racist state, an absolutely murderous state and an absolutely suicidal state&quot; (232), all of which are superimposed and converge on the Final Solution. <u>With the Final Solution, the state tries to eliminate, through the Jews, all other races. for whom the Jews were the symbol and the manifestation.</u> This includes, in one of Hitler's last acts, the order to destroy the bases of bare life for the German people itself. &quot;Final solution for other races, the absolute suicide of the German race&quot; is inscribed, according to Foucault, in the functioning of the modern state (232).<br />

<em><span style="color: black;">4. The New Logic of Risk: Taking Precautions against Terrorism </span></em><span style="color: black;">Responsible science and responsible policymaking operate on the precautionary principle. (Blair, 2002) What, then, is this new dispositif of governing terrorism through risk? We argue that precautionary risk has emerged in the dispositif of risk to govern terrorism, where other technologies have proven fallible or insufficient. Precautionary risk has modified or supplemented other technologies of risk management and has reconfigured them at the horizon of the double infinity of terrorism. According to Ewald, ‘the precautionary principle does not target all risk situations but only those marked by two principal features: a context of scientific uncertainty on the one hand and the possibility of serious and irreversible damage on the other’ (Ewald, 2002: 282).16 </span><u><span style="color: black;">This double infinity of risk is not intrinsic to terrorism, as Beck would probably maintain, but has emerged out of a contest over the representation of terrorism. We have seen that a risk dispositif consists of rationalities and technologies to monitor and predict dangerous occurrences in the future. Precautionary risk is based on four interlinked rationalities that allow for the deployment of specific technologies of government: zero risk, worst case scenario, shifting the burden of proof and serious and irreversible damage. These rationalities are derived from the catastrophic and radically contingent elements of risk and they replace the earlier rationalities of risk insurance: risk identification, risk reduction and risk spreading. Any level of risk is now considered unacceptable; risk must be avoided at all costs. Risk minimization and other forms of risk management</span></u><span style="color: black;"> (such as ‘contingency planning’) derive from the joint realization that the catastrophe will happen. The worst case scenario and its irreversible damages logically lead to a politics of zero risk which modifies the solidaristic equation that took for granted that a risk was acceptable as long as it was reparable or repaired (Ewald, 2002: 284). As a result, the dispositif of insurance has tipped towards drastic prevention. If responsibility in insurance was reduced to the case of moral hazards (when the behaviour of the insured was likely to lead to risk)17 and was therefore part of the assessment for the purpose of compensation, the precautionary principle holds the other responsible for ‘irreparable damage’. Against immeasurable and irreparable damage, George Bush’s ‘infinite justice’ gains its full meaning</span><u><span style="color: black;">. The sanctioning of those deemed responsible becomes itself immeasurable, therefore infinite. From ‘Bin Laden dead or alive’ to ‘infinite justice’ we discover the whole spectrum of practices activated by risk</span></u><span style="color: black;"> — from the imaginary of vengeance against an individual evil-doer and his accomplices on the model of criminal sanctioning and responsibility to the infinite sanctioning of suspects<u>. The debates around pre-emptive strikes, the exceptional status of Guantanamo Bay, practices of extraordinary rendition or indefinite detention in the UK appear as technologies appropriate to precautionary risk.</u> The other does not only harbour a catastrophic risk, but groups of high risk cannot be easily detected. If risk management based on insurance technologies could function within the horizon of knowledge, precautionary risk faces the limits of knowledge that subvert the traditional means of risk management. The insurance paradigm of <u>risk was based on scientific calculus and group profiling. Profiling as a technology of ‘social sorting’ (Lyon, 2002) depends on the categorization of social groups, their profiling and statistical computation of risk.</u> Once terrorist suspects cannot be clearly identified through technologies of profiling, we have a renewed panopticism, forms of surveillance that target everybody, as the potential terrorist could be any of us. Gordon Woo, one of the best-known risk analysts of the London-based firm <em>Risk Management Solutions</em> has formulated this dilemma of the undetectable terrorist: What would be especially puzzling to security forces is the apparently haphazard variation in the commitment of a specific individual to the terrorist cause. Such individuals would not be classified as hard-liners, and would soon disappear from the terrorist radar screen … These individuals may not themselves have any prolonged history of links with radical groups, so they would be hard to identify in advance as potential suspects … (Woo, 2002) The traditional technologies of risk management become more extensive, as profiling and surveillance attempt to encompass the whole population (van Munster, 2004). As the underestimation of intelligence and knowledge is considered irresponsible from the viewpoint of precautionary risk, the scope and field of intelligence needs to be enlarged accordingly. Yet<u>, at the limit of knowledge, intelligence becomes itself insufficient.</u> The Home Office official report on the 7/7 London bombings points out this conundrum: nothing marked out the four men involved in the attacks, they were all ‘unexceptional’ (Home Office, 2006). Therefore 9/11 has given way to more pro-active forms of surveillance of suspect populations, leading to a surplus supply of data and an over prediction of threats (Lyon, 2003; Levi and Wall, 2004; Amoore and de Goede, 2005). <u>Precautionary risk management <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">implies the surveillance of all the population</span>, of all flights for example, independent of existing intelligence. Hence more and more technologies of surveillance are indiscriminately targeted at the whole population: stop and search policies in the UK, biometric identifiers or the introduction of identity cards. If profiling had a racist effect, targeting surveillance towards racial minorities, the governance of terrorism supplements this form of racist profiling with a renewed desire for total surveillance. While profiling is still essential in the war on terror, its targets are increasingly arbitrary.</u> Beyond categories of religious and ethnic affiliation, all other characteristics become blurred. Terrorists can be unemployed or employed, poor or not so poor, young or old, legal residents or citizens, illegal migrants or tourists. Uncertainty slowly extends profiling to the entirety of the population. Precautionary technologies therefore change the relation to social groups, to the population as created by the dispositif of insurance. Statistical computation and risk management relied upon the scientific representation of social groups that were to be governed; profiling was an important technology for selecting these groups and targeting them. At the limit of knowledge, this relation to representation becomes an arbitrary connection. Gordon Lafer (2005: 341) has noted that in the United States, Latin American immigrants were treated with increased suspicion despite the lack of any evidence of a link with terrorist attacks. <u>The link with knowledge can be loosened at the horizon of infinite damage and uncertainty. The imperative of zero-risk led to policies such as ‘shoot-to-kill’ in Britain which claimed its first victim immediately after the 7 July attacks. Political decisions can also no longer sustain the imaginary of being grounded in the certainties of science, as the precautionary principle severs or rather exposes in its contingency the very relation between knowledge and politics. Tony Blair’s response to criticism against his position on the war in Iraq brings to light a politics of decision which has severed its relation with science</u>, with expertise or with management: Sit in my seat. Here is the intelligence. Here is the advice. Do you ignore it? But, of course, intelligence is precisely that: intelligence. <em>It is not hard fact. It has its limitations.</em> On each occasion, the most careful judgment has to be made taking account of everything we know and advice available. But in making that judgment, would you prefer us to act, even if it turns out to be wrong? Or not to act and hope it’s OK? And suppose we don’t act and the intelligence turns out to be right, how forgiving will people be? (Blair, 2004) Expert knowledge is exposed as an insufficient and unreliable resource for political decisions. If the contingency of political <u>decisions could be ‘hidden’ under the weight of knowledge and the necessity of expertise, they now reappear as ungrounded, arbitrary attempts to subdue the contingency of the future. When the limits of technical or scientific knowledge are exposed, politics discloses its own necessary decisionism, its immanent limit. Yet, this does not mean that knowledge no longer plays any role in risk management, that the imaginary of knowledge grounding politics has been undone. The ‘managers of unease’, in Bigo’s formulation, always try to use first the already available technologies. Blair’s approach to the war in Iraq has wavered between an initial reliance on intelligence and a later invocation of the ‘uncertainty’ of this knowledge. The rationality of catastrophic risk translates into policies that <em>actively</em> seek to prevent situations from becoming catastrophic at some indefinite point in the future. War is mobilized alongside other technologies of precaution in a governmental dispositif to avoid terrorist irruptions in the future.</u> The ‘war on terror’ or the consequent war of Afghanistan and Iraq do not speak of a recent rediscovery of militarism, but of a governmentality that activates all the technologies imaginable in the face of uncertainty.18 Christopher Coker has also pointed out that war is one option for avoiding the bleak promise of the future, for ‘when we do turn to the military option we do so to reduce the opportunities for bad behaviour, to prevent them from posing an even greater risk in the future’ (Coker, 2002b).</span><br />

Mitchell 98 [Gordon Mitchell, Professor of Communications at the University of Pittsburgh, “Reflexive Fiat: Incorporating The Outward Activist Turn Into Contest Strategy”, The Rostrum 72 (January 1998): 11-20]<br />
<span class="Underline">Most mainstream conceptions of fiat contain a common structural feature, the idea that fiat is a construction which affords debaters the latitude to make assumptions about external actors. The assumption that a specified agent will &quot;carry out the plan&quot; if the affirmative team proves its desirability inscribes this externality by structurally separating the advocate from the specified agent of change. Likewise, the idea that the negative team &quot;has the power&quot; to mandate an alternative course of action by the same (or another) external actor endorses this same kind of structural separation between debater and the agent of change. Advocacy, under this view of fiat, takes place on the plane of simulation. The power that backs a debaters' command that &quot;we mandate the following. . . &quot; is a mirage, a phantasm allowed to masquerade as genuine for the purpose of allowing the game of political simulation to take place. Debaters have no real authority over the actors they employ to implement their ideas in plans and counterplans, yet the simulation of such authority is recognized as an essential fiction necessary to allow the game of policy debate to unfold. One problem with approaches to fiat which feature such a structural separation between advocate and agent of change is that such approaches tend to <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">instill <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">political apathy</span> by inculcating a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">spectator mentality</span></span></strong>. The function of fiat which gives debaters simulated political control over external actors coaxes students to gloss over consideration of their concrete roles as involved agents in the controversies they research. The construct of fiat, in this vein, serves as a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">political crutch</span> by alleviating the burden of demonstrating a connection between in-round advocacy and the action by external actors defended in plan or counterplan mandates. A second manner in which the structural features of this sort of fiat tend to <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">circumscribe active political involvement</span></span></strong> is through the containment of fiat action within the spatio-temporal boundaries of the contest round. The fiction of simulated authority evaporates when the judge issues his/her decision and the debaters disband and head to the next round. Advocacy, resting on the ephemeral foundation of simulation, is here a casual and fleeting phenomenon that carries with it few significant future ramifications or responsibilities. By cultivating an ethic of detachment of the actual polis, this view of advocacy introduces a politically regressive dynamic into the academic debate process. Reflexive fiat, on the other hand, can be structurally differentiated from &quot;external&quot; fiat in four ways. First, reflexive fiat collapses the gulf separating advocate from agent of action; debaters assume the dual role of advocate and actor simultaneously. While the proposed course of action may ramify upon external actors, such reactions are not mandated by fiat, but are instead considered as policy effects. Second, because the advocate is physically present and in direct control of the range of possible actions available, the necessity of framing fiat power as simulation is obviated; fiat becomes a tangible mandate for concrete action, not just a hypothetical suggestion for simulated action by external actors. Third, by making a commitment to carry out future concrete action rather than temporarily simulating commitment to action, reflexive fiat explodes the spatio-temporal limitation of the contest round itself. The judges' affirmation of a course of action defended under a reflexive fiat framework entails consequences which extend beyond the time and place of the tournament. Fourth, the authority to propose courses of action using reflexive fiat does not flow from the resolution, but is instead pragmatically grounded in the physical presence of advocates, underwritten by evidence of the advocate's speechmaking capabilities and proof of mobilization potential. These structural features enable the theory of reflexive fiat to steer debate participants toward an activist political trajectory. Transcending the spectator orientation encouraged by the received view of external fiat, advocates who defend courses of action backed by reflexive fiat in contest rounds make the commitment to directly engage the issues they identify as pressing public concerns. Unlike the temporally ephemeral political commitment entailed in the defense of simulated plans, the commitment to future action made with reflexive fiat carries with it an outward activist imperative. This imperative is actualized with the judge's act of voting; in voting, the judge not only issues a competitive reward to the reflexive fiat advocate, but makes public the expectation that the specified mandates will be implemented in the manner described. </span><br />

A utilitarian position as disinterested policymakers replicates oppression, and excludes minorities from debate just like they are from public policy – prefer reflexive fiat, which takes into account the viewpoints of urban debaters like us and creates the impetus to change debate and public policy through infusing minority viewpoints away from detached analysis<br />

<span class="Underline">When we were on the negative side, I would argue, among other things, that poverty should be allowed to continue because it would eventually trigger a glorious socialist revolution (which isn't even good Marxist theory, let alone a morally acceptable position to put forward) , or that civil liberties should be eradicated so the United States could transition to a society in which resource use was limited by force, family size was strictly controlled, and thus planeta ry destruction was averted. The reason I call this process a white one is because whites (and especially affluent ones), much more so than folks of color, have the luxury of looking at life or death issues of war, peace , famine, unemployment, or criminal justice as a game, as a mere exercise in intellectual and rhetorical banter. For me to get up and debate, for example, whether or not full employment is a good idea, presupposes that my folks are not likely out of work as I go about the task. To debate whether racial profiling IS legitimate likewise presupposes that I, the Senator, am not likely to be someone who was confronted by the practice as my team drove to the Debate] tournament that day, or as we passed through security at the airport. In this way, competitive Debate reinforces whiteness and affluence as normative conditions , and makes the process far more attractive to affluent white students. Kids of color and working-class youth of all colors are simply not as likely to gravitate to an activity where pretty much half the time they'll be forced to take positions that, if implemented in the real world , might devastate their families and communities. Because Senators are encouraged to think about life or death matters as if they had little consequence beyond a given Debate round , the fact that those who have come through the activity go on to hold a disproportionate share of powerful political and legal positions-something about which the National Forensics League has long bragged- is a matter that should concern us all. Being primed to think of serious issues as abstractions increases the risk that the person who has been so primed will reduce everything to a brutal cost-benefit analysis, which rarely prioritizes the needs and interests of society's less powerful. Rather, it becomes easier at that point to support policies that benefit the haves at the expense of the have-nots, because the damage will be felt by others whom the ex-debaters never met and never had to take se rio usly. Unless debate is fundamentally transformed- and at this point the only forces for real change are the squads from <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></span></strong>rban <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">D</span></span></strong>ebate <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">L</span></span></strong>eagues who are clamoring for different styles of argumentation and different evidentiary standards- it will continue to serve as a staging ground for those whose interests are mostly the interests of the powerful. Until the voices of economically and racially marginalized persons are given equal weight in Debate rounds with those of affluent white experts (whose expertise is only presumed because other whites published what they had to say in the first place), the ideas that shape our world will continue to be those of the elite, no matter how destructive these ideas have proven to be for the vast majority of the planet's inhabitants. Until Debate is substantially diversified, so that previously ignored voices will have a chance to be heard on their own terms, and in their own styles, little will change. What Debate needs most IS an infusion of persons who because of their life experiences are almost guaranteed to be less naive; people who know full well that the system is anything but fair. Such persons have a right to be heard, and white, upper-middle-class, and affluent debaters need to hear them. They need to know how power works, and they will never gain an understanding of that by listening over and over to the voices of others like themselves. But <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Debate will never change</span></span></strong> in this <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">way unless the gatekeepers of the activity are prepared to step up and demand it</span></span></strong>, not just with their words but with their actions, their money, their judging criteria, and even their ballots. Folks of color and working-class folks won't join an activity if they feel their wisdom isn't going to be taken seriously. If they wanted to be ignored, they would hardly need to get dressed up and travel to Debate tournaments in a hot van to do it. They could stay home and be ignored, because the powerful ignore them every day anyway. Understand, this is no mere ethical plea for inclusion. Continuing to ignore the v01ces of the marginalized carries great risks for us all, because it is precisely such persons who so often view the world differently and far more accurately than the privileged . As a case in point, the polls taken right before the U.S. <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">invasion of Iraq</span></span></strong> in March 2003 indicated broad white support for going to war, but almost nonexistent support among blacks. Most white folks were convinced not only of the war's moral legitimacy, but were sure that everything would go swimmingly, because other white people like Rumsfeld and Cheney said so. But black folks knew better. <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Those with privilege had the luxury of thinking they would be greeted as liberators</span></span></strong>. But black folks know that invaders rarely bring true freedom-they've been there, done that. For the sake of us all, and to slow down the rate at which blood 1S spilled across the globe, we desperately need to listen to those who live <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">without the luxury of blinders</span></span></strong>.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">I. INTRODUCTION In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, domestic and foreign political actors who might otherwise have balked if the world's lone superpower claimed a broad right to use force abroad instead offered the U.S. a strong showing of goodwill and support. n1 Perhaps interpreting this solidarity as willingness to support American uses of force abroad regardless of their permissibility under international law, the Bush administration articulated a provocative interpretation of the right of self-defense recognized in the United Nations Charter. In a formal policy statement, the administration claimed that this right, which is an exception to the general prohibition of the use of force in international relations, justified the use of preemptive force against &quot;enemies&quot; of the United States. n2 The Bush administration's assertion of a right of preemptive self-defense, along with its reliance on this purported right to justify its use of force against Iraq, has drawn considerable criticism on international law grounds. n3 It is debatable whether [*112] anticipatory self-defense is permissible under international law. However, the Bush administration's preemption strategy calls for the use of force beyond the scope of the right of self-defense, even if the right is broadly construed. The Bush administration released its formal policy statement, &quot;The National Security Strategy of the United States of America&quot; (&quot;NSS&quot;), in September 2002. n4 This document outlines various considerations that are said to guide the administration's foreign policy decisions. n5 Of particular interest is the document's treatment of two categories of &quot;enemies:&quot; &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;rogue states.&quot; The NSS contains no specific definition of the term &quot;terrorists.&quot; However, the term includes states that &quot;knowingly harbor or . . . aid&quot; terrorists. n6 The NSS defines &quot;rogue states&quot; as those states with characteristics that match certain enumerated criteria and explicitly includes Iraq and North Korea in this category. n7 The document argues that the emergence of these &quot;new deadly challenges&quot; has effected a &quot;profound transformation&quot; in the &quot;security environment,&quot; n8 and has brought about a &quot;new world&quot; in which &quot;the only path to peace and security is the path of action.&quot; n9 In the context of the NSS, the noun &quot;action,&quot; the verb &quot;act,&quot; and various derivations of these words were used euphemistically to refer to the use of military force by the U.S. against its &quot;enemies.&quot; n10 The &quot;action&quot; contemplated against terrorists and rogue state is not limited to deterrence of and response to the use or threat of force by these groups, but includes action &quot;against such emerging threats before they are fully formed.&quot; n11 The U.S. will &quot;not hesitate to act alone&quot; to prevent terrorists and rogue states from attacking or threatening to attack, and will &quot;exercise [its] right of self-defense,&quot; as the administration understands it, &quot;by acting preemptively.&quot; n12 The U.S. will &quot;no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as [it did] in the past,&quot; nor will it &quot;let . . . enemies strike first,&quot; or &quot;remain idle while dangers gather.&quot; n13 Thus, under the NSS, military force is to be used preemptively to &quot;forestall or [*113] prevent . . . hostile acts by our adversaries.&quot; n14 While the administration suggested at least one other justification for using force against Iraq, n15 it relied in part on its asserted right to preemptive self-defense. n16 The commencement of U.S. efforts to put its theory of preemptive self-defense into practice warrants an examination of whether self-defense is a valid justification for using force in these circumstances. The authors of the NSS believe that the preemptive use of force is compatible with international law. n17 The NSS states that, &quot;for centuries, international law [has] recognized that nations need not suffer an attack&quot; before using force in self-defense &quot;against forces that present an imminent danger of attack.&quot; n18 Preemption, the document asserts, has been regarded as legitimate under international law when undertaken with respect to an &quot;imminent threat--most often a visible mobilization&quot; of military forces. n19 Without further explanation of what &quot;imminent threat&quot; means, the NSS asserts that &quot;we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today's adversaries.&quot; n20 &quot;The greater the threat&quot; posed by these adversaries, the &quot;more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action . . . even if uncertainty remains as to [*114] the time and place of the enemy's attack.&quot; n21 The NSS's brief mention of the legality of the new U.S. strategy provides an incomplete analysis of the relevant norms. The NSS treats the permissible temporal scope of self-defense as a matter of settled law. It thus ignores an ongoing scholarly and international debate concerning when force may first be used. n22 The document also fails to fully consider the application of two customary international law principles, necessity and proportionality, to uses of force called for by the preemption strategy. n23 Moreover, the NSS does not indicate the source of the authority of the U.S. to unilaterally &quot;adapt the concept of imminent threat&quot; to suit its present needs. n24 Analysis of these gaps in the NSS's consideration of relevant international law suggests that the administration's confidence in the legality of preemptive self-defense is misplaced. II. THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER AND A STATE'S RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE Scholars regard the United Nations Charter (Charter) as the &quot;starting point&quot; for analyzing the relevant norms restricting the ability of states to threaten or use force. n25 The Charter's text amply demonstrates its drafters' fundamental concern with limiting instances in which the use of force in international relations would be considered legally permissible. The preamble begins with an expression of the signatories' determination &quot;to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,&quot; and describes the &quot;principles and . . . methods&quot; contained in the substantive portion of the Charter as being aimed at &quot;ensuring . . . that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest.&quot; n26 The first of the &quot;Purposes of the United Nations&quot; listed in Article 1 is &quot;to maintain international peace and security.&quot; n27 The second Purpose commits the U.N. to [*115] &quot;take . . . appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.&quot; n28 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">One of the highest moments of comedy during the 2008 US Presidential election occurred when ABC News’s Charlie Gibson asked Sarah Palin whether she agreed with the right of anticipatory self-defense that has become known as the Bush Doctrine. “In what respect, Charlie?” Palin responded, appearing to have no idea what Gibson was referring to. She flubbed her way through an answer, and let Gibson feed her some more rope lest she totter off her seat. Candidate Obama, on the other hand, appeared to know exactly what the Bush doctrine was. In the primaries, he said he was willing to strike first in a place like Pakistan if he believed he’d be able to take out Osama Bin Laden. Since President Obama was elected in November 2008, it remained unclear whether or not he endorsed the Bush doctrine as it was defined in the 2002 National Security Strategy. Vice President Biden gave some remarks in a July 2009 interview which I argued inched uncannily close to the view articulated in President Bush’s National Security Strategy. And when Obama at last reveals his National Security Strategy, we’re supposed to have a clearer picture of whether or not he believes in the right of anticipatory self-defense. Except, so far, we don’t know where he’s going with it. The AP got a peek at a summary of the Obama National Security Strategy, and there does not appear to be a clear answer to this question in what they read, although they’re not willing to say so: The National Security Strategy will be the first produced under President Barack Obama, laying out his goals. The document, like those from other presidents, is purposely vague. The AP obtained the summary ahead of document’s planned release by the White House this week. The strategy was expected to walk away from a position held by Bush that the United States could or should undertake pre-emptive wars. Bush’s 2002 National Security Strategy posited that doctrine, and the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq made good on it. via Associated Press. ‘Was expected to’ is not the same as ‘will walk away from.’ Clearly where the Bush doctrine is concerned, Obama’s handlers kept the strategy’s contents close to their vests. I would think there is only one reason for that – they will offer some language that is perhaps watered down, but in no way repudiates the Bush doctrine. Other national security watchers portray a similar lack of clarity on which way Obama will be taking the Bush doctrine. Over at Foreign Policy, Will Inboden writes that there is no clear repudiation of the Bush doctrine: Some media coverage, such as Peter Baker’s New York Times article, attempts to portray the speech as a “repudiation” or at least distancing from the Bush administration’s grand strategy, and makes much of the fact that he did not emphasize “unilateral American power” or affirm “pre-emption” or “prevention.” Baker is one of the very best, and best-sourced, White House correspondents around, so it may be that his article reflects some additional background conversations with Obama administration staff attempting to advance a particular message. But at least when it comes to the text of the speech, here I think Baker’s article overshoots. For example, in the midst of discussing the importance of international cooperation, Obama described American leadership in “steering those currents in the direction of liberty and justice” — in other words, a polite way of saying that American power and influence will continue to shape the international order. Or the fact that President Obama did not explicitly affirm the possibility of the preemptive use of force does not mean that his Administration actually rejects it. As historian John Gaddis has shown, since the days of John Quincy Adams (while Secretary of State to James Monroe), American presidents have reserved, and sometimes used, the right to take action against looming threats. Unless President Obama were to explicitly reject the possibility of ever using force in a preemptive or preventive manner to protect the nation (highly unlikely), it will remain an option within American national security doctrine. Keeping with the theme that if you don’t repudiate it, it remains an option, Spencer Ackerman points to Obama’s actions in the past year, and sees a pretty clear reliance on tools from President Bush’s utility shed in the mix: At West Point, Obama argued that al-Qaeda’s “small men on the wrong side of history” ought not to “scare us” into “discard[ing] our freedoms.” But Obama’s first 18 months in office have featured a series of civil-libertarian compromises, from retaining the military commissions for terrorist trials he opposed as a senator to embracing a framework for indefinite detention without charge for terrorism detainees even beyond those at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility he has yet to convince Congress to close. He has expanded the previous administration’s use of remotely-piloted aircraft to launch missiles at terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Pakistan to places like Yemen, where a new al-Qaeda affiliate has trained operatives to attack the U.S. homeland, and even claimed the right to kill an American citizen suspected of involvement with al-Qaeda without due process. The drones once targeted the seniormost extremists, but anecdotal evidence suggests the administration is using them on a lower echelon of terrorist as well. Looking at these perspectives, you can expect the Obama National Security Strategy to be packaged with a lot of spin. Without saying outright that the Bush doctrine has been tossed aside, Obama officials will tell the press that preventive military action against gathering threats is no longer the the focus on of America’s strategy. But while something is not the focus of his plans, all the pie-in-the-sky rhetoric about international cooperation does not forestall the Obama administration from acting very Bush-like whenever should it have the desire to. And that means as far as our nation is concerned, the Bush doctrine is still on the books. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">President Barack Obama started strong by announcing the end of torture and the closing of Guantánamo, but he has recently taken a more equivocal attitude toward the Bush constitutional legacy. While rejecting his predecessor's extreme claims, he continues to assert the presidential power to hold terrorists without trial and to keep state secrets from the courts. And he has already issued his first signing statement denouncing a few provisions of the stimulus package as unconstitutionally limiting his executive prerogatives. These decisions have unleashed a flood of anxious commentary about Obama's ultimate intentions. But the discussion has only served to divert public attention from the real question confronting the new administration. Barack Obama is no George W. Bush -- he will indeed cut back substantially on unilateral assertions of power. The big question is whether he will take effective steps to prevent the next president from reversing course yet again and using the precedents of the Bush years as a springboard for even more extreme assertions of executive authority. Anything Obama does through executive order can be reversed by the next president through a countervailing executive order.

<span class="Underline">It may be that the United States and United Kingdom governments were frustrated by an inability to obtain the necessary Security Council resolutions. The call by the Australian government for a change in international law to address terrorism may also be seen to be a product of frustration. However if change is to be effected, it must be carried out in way that promotes international peace and security through multilateral action and the rule of law. This may be time consuming and frustrating, but the alternative danger is a weakening or even abandonment of the rule of law and undermining the prohibition on the use of force which has been the product of not only the international consensus to avoid war following two world wars but decades of consensus. The danger of setting a precedent for the use of force by other states is self evident. As one scholar recently observed in a different context, “[i]f the principle of reciprocity ensures that any state claiming a right under general customary international law accords that same right to every other state, states will only claim rights which they are prepared to see generalized. This is because a generalized right subjects the state to corresponding obligations vis-àvis all other states.” 19 In this context, Mr Howard’s citation of the attack on Pearl Harbour was of interest since a claimed motivation for Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbour was to prevent a feared military buildup by the United States. 20 In the following decade, in 1950, following a debate on a preemptive strike on the Soviet Union, the United States President Truman said that, “you don't 'prevent' anything by war...except peace.&quot; Already following the attack on Iraq, Indian officials have suggested there is a strong case for military action against Pakistan 21 and United States officials and leaders have used threatening rhetoric against Syria 22 and Iran. 23 If a ‘preventive war’ by the United States against North Korea is perceived to be avoided due to the possession by North Korea of nuclear weapons, 24 then that would be a powerful incentive for non-nuclear states to seek to acquire nuclear weapons to protect themselves against attack and would thus be a stimulus for nuclear proliferation rather than the rule of law. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Iran is likely to respond to any US attack using its considerable missile arsenal against US forces in Iraq and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. Israel may attempt to stay out of the conflict, it is not clear whether Iran would target Israel in a retaliatory strike but it is certainly possible. If the US attack includes nuclear weapons use against Iranian facilities, as I believe is very likely, rather than deterring Iran it will cause a much more violent response. Iranian military forces and militias are likely to storm into southern Iraq and the US may be forced to use nuclear weapons against them, causing large scale casualties and inflaming the Muslim world. There could be popular uprisings in other countries in the region like Pakistan, and of course a Shiite uprising in Iraq against American occupiers. Finally I would like to discuss the grave consequences to America and the world if the US uses nuclear weapons against Iran. First, the likelihood of terrorist attacks against Americans both on American soil and abroad will be enormously enhanced after these events. And terrorist's attempts to get hold of &quot;loose nukes&quot; and use them against Americans will be enormously incentivized after the US used nuclear weapons against Iran. Second, it will destroy America's position as the leader of the free world. The rest of the world rightly recognizes that nuclear weapons are qualitatively different from all other weapons, and that there is no sharp distinction between small and large nuclear weapons, or between nuclear weapons targeting facilities versus those targeting armies or civilians. It will not condone the breaking of the nuclear taboo in an unprovoked war of aggression against a non-nuclear country, and the US will become a pariah state. Third, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will cease to exist, and many of its 182 non-nuclear-weapon-country signatories will strive to acquire nuclear weapons as a deterrent to an attack by a nuclear nation. With no longer a taboo against the use of nuclear weapons, any regional conflict may go nuclear and expand into global nuclear war. Nuclear weapons are million-fold more powerful than any other weapon, and the existing nuclear arsenals can obliterate humanity many times over. In the past, global conflicts terminated when one side prevailed. In the next global conflict we will all be gone before anybody has prevailed. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization. Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately. There is also a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan for instance, is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The preemptive nature of the Iraq War, in contrast to the Vietnam War, poses a more profound question for the future. Vietnam raised the classic question of whether the Executive was acting on its own, and therefore unlawfully, or whether Congress had authorized military action under its war powers. The Iraq War, on the other hand, presents the question - not yet presented to any American court - of whether there is any power anywhere in the Constitution for any branch of government to declare preemptive war. That is, even if Congress did purport to authorize the Iraqi invasion, could it? Does the Legislative branch (or the Legislative and Executive branches acting together) have the power to authorize an unprovoked deployment of troops for the purpose of invading another country? I believe not, or at least believe there are excellent constitutional arguments to the contrary. n26 If we stick with our present-cultivated judicial ignorance, however, the political question doctrine will ensure that no United States court ever hears those arguments. This is true even where it may be demonstrated - or at least argued - that the military action was preemptive of nothing more than unproven and vague allegations. If preemptive war goes unchallenged and unchallengeable, we are left with a recipe for near-certain disaster: the continuing worldwide proliferation of military armaments, the &quot;unappeased demons of national, ethnic, religious, and class fury,&quot; n27and the disproportionate and unwise United States response to those realities. n28 We could do something about the last element; instead, by arguing the international lawfulness and logic of preemptive war, we have ensured that other countries will imitate the argument to justify other acts of aggression. n29 This usurpation of the logic of politics by the logic of war - this syndrome by which power becomes its own end - is the &quot;recurring tragedy of republics.&quot; n30 </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">What impact will the Iraq war of 2003 have on international law governing the use of force and on the future of the United Nations Security Council? Some commentators have proclaimed that the military intervention led by the United States amounted to the &quot;death&quot; of the UN Charter and the end of &quot;the grand attempt to subject the use of force to the rule of law.&quot; n1 The Security Council's failure to reach agreement--in the face of French-U.S. antagonisms--spells the end, they argue, of an effective Council role in addressing major threats [*629] to peace and security. n2 My own view is that it is premature to pronounce the &quot;death&quot; of the UN Charter or to give up on future prospects for Security Council agreement on the use of force. We are, nevertheless, at a difficult and precarious transitional moment in the international legal system governing the use of force, and the stark tensions reflected in the differences over Iraq are symptomatic of hard problems that may persist for the foreseeable future. Both the rules and the system need refining and reform. Success in doing so will require imagination and much greater willingness by policy makers to consider law's potential role, not as a barrier to necessary action, but as a means to enhance global security in the face of emerging threats. In seeking such reform, it will be important to build upon the realism of the Charter's founders, who combined rules governing the use of force with a clear commitment to credible enforcement action in response to threats to peace and security. Without question, the stark disagreements between key Security Council members over how to respond to Iraq's violations of Security Council resolutions--during the 1990s and culminating in the 2003 war--do represent significant challenges for international law and institutions. But, as I will argue, the UN Charter still provides a viable and stabilizing framework for addressing threats to peace and security. It is far too early to announce the death of the UN Charter law regarding the use of force, for three reasons. I. RESOLUTION 1441 IN LIGHT OF EARLIER PRACTICE First, the question of legal authority for using force in Iraq is a much closer one than is sometimes acknowledged. True, the Iraq war was not explicitly authorized by the Security Council as its failure to adopt the ill-fated &quot;second resolution&quot; made clear. n3 Nor was there an actual or imminent armed attack by Iraq that would place a forcible response clearly within well-accepted parameters for self-defense. n4 However, based on the language of Security Council Resolution 1441 and the resolutions and practice that preceded it, the United States and its allies could plausibly argue that the Security Council had acknowledged the seriousness of the situation and had recognized--or at least had agreed to disagree over--the legal theory that force could be used in response to Iraq's &quot;material breach&quot; of the disarmament obligations imposed by the Security Council after the 1991 Gulf war. The story on this issue, in any event, is a complicated one. The United States and Britain maintained throughout the 1990s that Iraq's clear failure to comply with the Gulf war cease-fire terms in Resolution 687 constituted a &quot;material breach&quot; that reactivated Resolution 678's authorization to use force. n5 Invoking this theory, the United [*630] States and Britain--joined by France--used force against Iraq in 1993. n6 In 1998, after the Security Council found Iraq in &quot;flagrant violation of resolution 687,&quot; the United States and Britain again acted on this theory. n7 To be sure, other Security Council members raised challenges to this view, and the question whether a &quot;material breach&quot; by Iraq gave a coalition of willing states a right to use force to disarm Iraq was a hotly debated issue in the negotiations over Resolution 1441. The United States and Britain sought a resolution that would maximize the chances of effective coercive diplomacy to disarm Iraq and that would not require a second resolution to authorize force. France sought to avoid &quot;automaticity&quot; regarding potential use of force and worked to ensure an additional Security Council opportunity to determine what response should follow from Iraqi noncompliance. Adopted unanimously, Resolution 1441 was a welcome development after the debilitating divisiveness that plagued multilateral diplomacy toward Iraq during the mid- and late 1990s and eroded the Security Council's credibility. Resolution 1441 offered Iraq &quot;a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations&quot; and &quot;set up an enhanced inspection regime with the aim of bringing to full and verified completion the disarmament process&quot; established by Resolution 687 and subsequent Council resolutions. n8 But it was the clear U.S. threat to disarm Saddam Hussein by force if necessary that provided the backbone that gave this effort at coercive diplomacy a chance. Yet, on the central legal issue of authority to use force, Resolution 1441 provided something to each of the contending camps. Well aware of U.S. and British arguments and precedents based on their view that they possessed legal authority to use force in response to Iraqi &quot;material breach,&quot; the Security Council expressly declared in Resolution 1441 that &quot;Iraq has been and remains in material breach&quot; of its disarmament obligations under Resolution 687 and that any Iraqi failures to comply with Resolution 1441 would &quot;constitute a further material breach.&quot; n9 The Resolution also recalled the Council's repeated warnings to Iraq &quot;that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violation of its obligations.&quot; n10 But, in light of French and other views against &quot;automaticity,&quot; Resolution 1441 also provided that Iraq's failure &quot;at any time to comply with, and cooperate fully in the implementation of, this resolution . . . will be reported to the Council for assessment.&quot; n11 Moreover, the Security Council would &quot;convene immediately . . . in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security.&quot; n12 While a full public account of the understandings among Security Council members regarding Resolution 1441 has yet to be disclosed, the text of Resolution 1441 can fairly be read as an agreement to disagree over whether an additional Security Council resolution authorizing force was needed in the event of Iraqi noncompliance. French Ambassador to the United States Jean-David Levitte has recently admitted as much in recounting how he advised against introducing the &quot;second resolution&quot; that the British, Americans, and Spanish sought on Iraq. &quot;Weeks before it was tabled,&quot; Ambassador Levitte has stated, &quot;I went to the State Department and to [*631] the White House to say, don't do it. First, because you'll split the Council and second, because you don't need it. Let's agree to disagree between gentlemen, as we did on Kosovo, before the war in Kosovo . . . .&quot; n13 Moreover, Resolution 1441--in the carefully worded and painstakingly negotiated paragraph 12--expressly provided only for a Security Council meeting to &quot;consider&quot; Iraqi noncompliance. Nevertheless, the British, as well as other U.S. allies, viewed a &quot;second resolution&quot; as extremely important politically; they wanted to make a concerted final effort to achieve Council consensus, and few would dispute that express Council authorization would have been far preferable legally as well. Rather than follow Ambassador Levitte's suggestion--which no doubt would also have been preferred by many other Council members--the United States supported its key ally, Britain, in submitting the second resolution. n14 To the very end, the British worked hard to make the Charter system function effectively as they sought to secure a political consensus on the Security Council, which clearly would have enhanced the legitimacy of any subsequent action. Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Foreign Secretary Jack Straw argued eloquently for Council agreement in the face of a noncompliant Iraq; a credible threat of force by a unified Security Council, they argued, offered the best chance to compel Iraqi disarmament peacefully through coercive diplomacy. But France's adamant refusal to authorize the use of force under any circumstances and U.S. unwillingness to take the newly revived inspections through another round made Blair's efforts to chart a middle course ultimately unavailing. In the end, in a powerful and eloquent speech to the House of Commons on the eve of war, Blair argued the case for military action and its consistency with the Security Council's agreed demands on Iraq and the purposes of the United Nations. n15 The Council's repeated failure to stand up to Saddam Hussein's noncompliance undercut its credibility, Blair argued, and sent a dangerous message of irresolution to Saddam and other tyrants: &quot;To will the ends but not the means . . . would do more damage in the long term to the UN than any other course.&quot; n16 In short, those supporting the use of force, like those opposing it, viewed themselves as acting consistently with Resolution 1441 and with the purposes of the UN Charter, in spite of their inability to find common ground. And the ultimate failure to secure agreement on a &quot;second resolution,&quot; while deeply regrettable, n17 did not deprive the military action that followed of a plausible legal justification. II. THE CHARTER'S CORE STILL HOLDS Despite the intense discord on the Security Council over Iraq, it is premature to announce the death of the UN Charter for a second reason as well. Whatever disagreements there may [*632] be around the edges--and there are many--the central core of Article 2(4) is still alive. No one seriously disputes that wars of territorial expansion and conquest are unlawful under Article 2(4). This core of agreement was reflected in the Security Council's condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and North Korea's invasion of South Korea in 1950. n18 But there is more. The Charter's norms--which permit the use of force in self-defense or if authorized by the Security Council--together represent a great advance over those of earlier historical periods in which force could be used for almost any reason. Together, these norms establish nonintervention as the default rule, with a high burden of justification on those who would use force to resolve conflicts. n19 This default rule serves important stabilizing purposes: it pushes states to seek to resolve conflicts without resorting to war and it protects different cultures and communities from external intervention. Such a regime provides a positive force for global stability. By placing the burden of justification on those who would resort to force, the law of the UN Charter plays an important function in state decision making. As the late Abram Chayes eloquently discussed, the law governing force may not yield a simple black-or-white answer, but it can &quot;orient deliberation&quot; and &quot;guide within broad limits.&quot; n20 States cannot claim a right to go to war for any reason; on the contrary, states know that they must explain and justify their actions internationally in relationship to the Charter's norms. Moreover, in democratic states at least, the knowledge that an action must be justified publicly can have important effects on the decision-making process itself. As Chayes explains based on his firsthand experience during the Cuban missile crisis: &quot;The requirement of justification suffuses the basic process of choice. There is a continuous feedback between the knowledge that the government will be called upon to justify its action and the kind of action that can be chosen.&quot; n21 If anything, the need to explain and justify one's actions in relation to the Charter's norms governing force is becoming more important in building effective coalitions with allies whose domestic publics take these norms seriously--as the United States found in working with NATO allies in Kosovo n22 and in working with the British and other allies in Iraq. The issue of justification may become increasingly important in an information age in which publics are exposed to broader arrays of critical information and are more easily mobilized. Indeed, the Charter's basic normative content--namely, the clear justification for using force if it is in self-defense or if authorized by the Security Council--seems to be well accepted and understood among informed publics. In both Britain and the United States, for example, public opinion in support of going to war against Saddam Hussein increased significantly in [*633] the event the Security Council agreed to authorize it. n23 Conversely, the absence of Security Council support can dramatically reduce the acceptance of proposed actions by skeptical audiences, as in the case of the reaction to the war in large parts of the Muslim world. The widespread acceptance of the Charter framework--and the fact that all the major protagonists on the Security Council sought to explain and justify their actions within that framework--does not preclude violations, of course, or strong disagreements about what the Charter permits. But, in contrast to earlier eras, the need to explain and justify the use of force in relation to the Charter--and the international law of armed conflict as well--helps to limit &quot;the scope, the weapons, the duration, [and] the purposes for which force is used.&quot; n24 III. THE SYSTEM CAN EVOLVE A third reason why the law of the UN Charter is not &quot;dead&quot; is also apparent. Particularly during the last decade, there has been an evolution in the Security Council's interpretation of the rules that shows the ability of the system to adapt. Rigid textualist interpretations of the Charter may well be dead, but it is not clear that they were ever really alive. n25 The Charter itself, like the U.S. Constitution, is a living document deliberately designed by its founders to have the capacity to meet new threats to peace and security. n26 Since the early 1990s, for instance, the Security Council has shown a marked evolution in its characterization of &quot;threats to the peace&quot; to include humanitarian emergencies, the overthrow of democratically elected leaders, extreme repression of civilian populations and cross-border refugee flows threatening regional security, and failure to hold perpetrators of major atrocities accountable. n27 After the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the Security Council unanimously affirmed the right of self-defense in response to those attacks, just as NATO also invoked the self-defense provisions in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. n28 In the case of Kosovo, the response of the [*634] Security Council and the UN secretary-general to NATO's intervention is at least suggestive of the possible beginning of an emerging norm in support of humanitarian intervention in certain exceptional factual circumstances. n29 A substantial majority of the Security Council rejected a resolution condemning NATO's action, recognizing the legitimacy of a use of force in support of purposes and objectives laid down in Security Council resolutions in response to an urgent humanitarian emergency. While these developments show the capacity of the UN Charter regime to adapt and evolve, they also expose clear tensions in the system between key norms of the Charter--tensions between the Charter's human rights provisions and its norm of nonintervention, and tensions between the Security Council's failure to effectively enforce its own resolutions and the norms limiting unilateral resort to force. But the better response is not to cling to rigid conceptions of the UN Charter and declare the document dead, but rather to work, as Secretary-General Kofi Annan has tried to do, to resolve and mitigate these contradictory pressures through careful evolution. n30 IV. A TRANSITIONAL MOMENT: DOCTRINAL AND STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES While the UN Charter remains alive, serious and difficult issues must be grappled with in the aftermath of the deep divisions over the Iraq war. We are indeed at a challenging transitional moment in the international legal system governing the use of force. The post-September 11th conditions--which include a primary U.S. focus on counterterrorism, a unipolar world in which the United States enjoys predominant military power, and a desire among certain countries, most notably France, to counterbalance the United States--pose both doctrinal and structural challenges to the Charter system. To be sure, the UN Charter system faced numerous difficulties from the very start. n31 The Security Council was effectively paralyzed by discord and stalemate during much of the Cold War. Nevertheless, the relative, though imperfect, success of the Council in reaching agreement during the 1990s created rising expectations--among members and public opinion more broadly--that the Council could play a significant role in addressing threats to peace and security. To be effective, the Charter regime must now evolve to meet the additional doctrinal and structural challenges that emerged so starkly in the period after September 11th. First and foremost, there is the challenge of terrorism. The attacks of September 11, 2001, made clear the fundamental security challenge posed by nonstate actors who reject the most basic rules of international law and deliberately target civilians for brutal destruction. Terrorist networks are not constrained by the norms of reciprocity so central to the international legal system. Doctrinally, the potentially lethal combination of terrorists and weapons of mass destruction requires a rethinking of the scope of the right of self-defense. In confronting possible terrorist attacks that are uncertain in time or place but potentially devastating in their consequences, the concept of anticipatory self-defense must be reexamined and updated to account for this threat and reasonable forcible responses to it. The UN Security Council affirmed the right of self-defense in response to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but some [*635] members seem to view the problem of terrorism as primarily a law enforcement issue. Preventing and defending against terrorist attacks certainly requires law enforcement and intelligence cooperation on a global scale, but it may also require the appropriate and selective use of military force. The United States and its allies should reexamine the concept of self-defense and update their understanding both of the circumstances justifying resort to self-defense and the scope of permissible action in the post-September 11th world. Yet, rather than initiating a more focused attempt to refine the concept of anticipatory self-defense and working with allies on how to rethink the concept of imminent attack in light of the realities of terrorism, the United States government has articulated a doctrine of preemption whose parameters are uncertain and that is potentially very broad in scope. n32 On the one hand, the Bush administration's 2002 National Security Strategy grapples frankly and openly with the exceedingly difficult security challenges posed by terrorists and by rogue states that may acquire and possibly share weapons of mass destruction with terrorists, stressing the vital need to prevent these weapons from ever being used against the United States and its allies and friends. n33 On the other hand, the Strategy indicates a broader and more open-ended willingness to use force to prevent &quot;rogue&quot; states from acquiring weapons of mass destruction and to preempt &quot;hostile acts&quot; n34 and &quot;emerging threats before they are fully formed.&quot; n35 The very uncertainty of the doctrine's scope n36 and the subjective and often precarious nature [*636] of judgments about future threats have made the doctrine highly controversial, raising doubts about the reassuring nature of U.S. power in many parts of the world. n37 In its expansive form, the doctrine poses a challenge to the UN Charter framework itself n38 and has the potential to be destabilizing. n39 This has alarmed a number of U.S. allies rather than providing a basis for working together to update understandings of the right of self-defense--an effort that is clearly needed if the Charter framework is to remain relevant and effective in the face of today's urgent threats. At a time when terrorist networks challenge the very foundations of order and law--and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of rogue states poses severe threats to international stability--the United States has a stake in maintaining rules governing the use of force that can both protect American security and help to mobilize allies against those who challenge the agreed rules. In addition to the normative challenges ahead, the Security Council faces a severe test of its credibility. The future effectiveness and durability of the Security Council will depend on its willingness to take credible enforcement action in response to threats to peace and security. If the Charter system is to serve as a bulwark against those who would potentially use weapons of mass destruction, then the Council must be prepared to enforce its demands--to stand up to those who would defy its will. Unfortunately, throughout the later 1990s and in the immediate buildup to the 2003 war, the Council lacked collective spine on Iraq. Key Security Council members, in particular France and Russia, watered down the sanctions and inspections regimes that they themselves had agreed to put in place to contain Saddam Hussein, and their temporizing in the face of his defiance gave Saddam unwanted room for maneuver. n40 Structurally, America's predominant power vis-a-vis other Council members further complicated matters, for any effective military enforcement action against Baghdad would require substantial military power, inevitably casting the United States in the leading role. That fact, coupled with Washington's clear intention to achieve regime change in Iraq, not just the disarmament of Iraq, only reinforced France's oppositionist impulses and its tendency to view the Council as a means to counterbalance U.S. power. In short, just as the United States was reluctant to be constrained by the Security Council, France and others were reluctant to authorize the United States to be the enforcer of Council resolutions. Edward Luck put it well when he said that many states &quot;would prefer a weak Council to a strong one dominated by the United States. They are as ambivalent about American power as Washington is about international organization.&quot; n41 [*637] This dynamic risks becoming self-reinforcing. If the U.S. attitude toward the UN Security Council is one that says, &quot;We're doing the enforcing our way, just give us your blessing,&quot; then states like France will see the Council first and foremost as a vehicle to balance and constrain the preponderant power of the United States. But if France and others are not willing to support coercive diplomacy backed by a credible--and authorized--threat of force, then the United States will cease to turn to the Council, and the Council's role in responding to threats to peace and security will be diminished. This dynamic, while likely to continue in light of recent trends and attitudes, does not mean that the Council inevitably will fail to find consensus in responding to particular threats to peace and security. Many issues before the Council do not directly pose competing interests of the permanent members. Even where they do, the major powers may still find it in their interests to forge an agreement. More generally, the United States will sometimes find it beneficial to seek to legitimate its preponderant power by building multilateral support for its policies using the machinery of the Council. n42 Moreover, France will ultimately only undermine the very instrument it needs to play on the world stage if it uses the Security Council solely to counterbalance U.S. initiatives. In that sense, the counterbalancing dynamic may be self-limiting. Furthermore, as in Iraq, the British are likely to continue to strive to chart a middle course and find common ground--seeking a unified Council willing to ensure that its resolutions actually have some teeth--and the value of the U.S.-British alliance may induce the United States to pursue constructive diplomacy in the Security Council. But whether such efforts will succeed will depend on the interests of the leading members concerned, the particulars of the conflict at issue, the diplomatic skill of those involved, and the willingness of the major protagonists on the Council to find common ground. The Security Council's adoption of a resolution lifting the sanctions against Iraq, affirming the authority of the occupying powers and providing for a UN role was a positive development, but difficult times remain ahead. n43 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Kundmueller ‘2 [Michelle. The Journal of Legislation, 2002. ln] </span><br />
<span class="Underline">This Note has attempted to demonstrate some of the difficulties of applying customary international law in U.S. courts. At every level, there are unanswered questions. Many of these issues, like how &quot;general&quot; a practice or its acceptance must be in order to constitute customary international law, can only be given imprecise answers. Not only are these general problems inherent in all legal questions involving line-drawing in the defining of customary international law, but there is a virtual war being waged over where that line should be drawn and by whom. This issue, in turn, raises questions of constitutional importance, the gravity of which it is almost impossible to overstate. Practical concerns about the balance of powers, no less than theoretical misgivings over undermining our government's consentbased authority and legitimacy, demand our attention as the possibility of directly incorporating customary international law, perhaps even when in direct contravention of federal statute, comes closer to becoming a reality. Current cases do not present any of these possibilities as realities. They do, however, contain the beginnings of what could become fundamental structural changes in customary--and hence, United States--law should the judicial system prove dominant in determining customary international law. Current cases show U.S. courts, on a fairly modest level, defining, determining, and applying customary international law. The cases have yet to produce a real showdown between domestic, either constitutional or congressional, and customary law. To date, congressional and executive actions and statements have been taken as one type of evidence in determining the content of customary international law, but they have not served as dispositive or controlling in the face of overwhelming evidence that customary international law as a whole dictates a contrary outcome. This, of course, is the real issue. What happens when the will of the people or a dictate of the Constitution conflicts directly with customary international law? No doubt, our courts will do their best to interpret creatively so as to avoid such a conflict, but, eventually, the conflict will come, and a decision will be made. The conflict is inevitable due to the nature of modern customary international law. No longer delegated to issues traditionally understood as exterior, modern customary international law is beginning to define relationships between governments and their citizens and amongst citizens.

<span class="Underline">Because customary international law thus pervades the federal government, alternately limiting and expanding the powers of the respective branches, it becomes a defining body of law in relationship to the federal government. Hence, Paust writes, &quot;in the case of an unavoidable clash between fundamental human rights supported by customary international law and a federal statute, the human rights (which have a constitutional status) [*367] must prevail.&quot; 27 In normal conflicts between codified (treaty) international law and federal statute, the last-in-time rule applies; this rule dictates that whichever law was most recently enacted controls. 28 Paust claims that this rule dictates that, in conflicts between customary international law and federal statutes, customary international law always controls. 29 As Paust theorizes, &quot;customary international law would necessarily be 'last in time,' since custom is either constantly re-enacted through a process of recognition and behavior involving patterns of expectation and practice or it loses its validity and force as law.&quot; 30 By this reasoning, custom is always a controlling authority in the face of a directly conflicting federal statute. Cont… The argument against direct incorporation of customary international law focuses on several perceived evils, with the primary focus resting on lack of constitutional justification and incompatibility with constitutional principles such as separation of powers and democratic rule. In a Note that focuses specifically on the question of whether customary international law supersedes federal statutes, Garland A. Kelley takes a moderate position, claiming that customary international law should not supercede federal law, but that &quot;American courts must attempt to reconcile U.S. federal statutory law with conflicting international norms and standards, whenever possible.&quot; 42 In the course of explaining why federal law ought not be superseded by customary international law, based on constitutional interpretation, Kelley makes an argument for how customary international law has the potential to threaten some of the most basic premises of American constitutional government. Cont… This section of this Note, on the legal authority of customary international law vis-a-vis federal legislation, has not been included with the purpose of discovering which position is correct. Rather, the overview of this debate holds a central place in this Note because it demonstrates some of the issues at stake as U.S. courts begin to integrate customary international law into what were previously thought of as purely or primarily domestic issues. Admittedly, the number of cases using customary international law in this manner is still few and primarily based on some enabling federal statute. Nonetheless, these decisions take on a greater importance in light of the debate discussed above. Should theorists such as Paust and Lillich prevail, these early cases, taking the first modern steps in the process of identifying and applying customary international law would become crucial precedent in a law-making process that Congress would be powerless to overturn. On the other hand, the case law about to be analyzed will lie at the mercy of the will of the people and their Congress, should the theories of Kelley and Garland prove prophetic. It is still too early to know which faction will dominate, but this analysis of their theories does survey the potential spectrum of outcomes and the legal and political issues yet to be determined. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Perhaps because of the inherent weaknesses in these international convention arguments, the George W. Bush administration also prepared itself to make an argument invoking international custom. n99 The President's speeches, after September 11th, began to be heavily laden with words and theories that suggested Hussein was an immediate threat to national security. n100 The U.S. was preparing to defend its actions as legitimately within [*21] the bounds allowed by international law. n101 Unfortunately, no other members of the Security Council, other than Great Britain, were willing to accept this argument. n102 The U.S. could not convince the other members of the Security Council that Hussein presented an immediate danger for which no other response but the use of force was available. n103 Part of the difficulty in convincing other members of the Security Council can be attributed to the failure of diplomacy. Unlike his father, President George H.W. Bush, who had extensive foreign policy experience, President George W. Bush was given to making bold decisions on the international front without consulting our allies. n104 In addition, two of his most trusted advisors, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, were old warriors of previous administrations who were reaching the end of their careers and, as a result, felt freer to suggest extreme positions and make politically insensitive comments that would only serve to alienate our allies. n105 The lack of diplomacy made it more difficult to convince our allies that they should adopt our way of thinking. France, in particular, felt slighted by the unilateralism that the United States was beginning to exercise. n106 President Jacques Chirac considered himself the elder statesman of global diplomacy and politics, and he did not appreciate the lack of consultation by the Bush administration. n107 Russia and China had their own difficulties with the new unilateralism that the U.S. government was exercising, and both wanted to restrain the actions of the [*22] world's only remaining superpower. n108 It did not help that the Bush administration had made it known that regime change in Iraq had now become a new foreign policy goal of the United States. n109 When the time came to give Hussein one last chance to comply with U.N. demands for weapons inspections, the members of the Security Council failed to cooperate. n110 Members of the Security Council refused to believe that the United States was serious about enforcement. They felt the United States was using the Security Council as a vehicle to provide cover for itself under international law as it prepared for a unilateral war against Iraq. n111 This was a critical miscalculation on the part of Security Council members who opposed the United States' unilateralism. In a way, these Security Council members abandoned their obligations under Articles 24 and 39 of the U.N. Charter to maintain international peace and security, and this played right into the hands of the United States' view of the need for immediate action. n112 The United States had invested much time in demonstrating that Hussein was not a rational actor that could be contained like Cold War adversaries of the past. n113 Unlike the Soviet Union of years gone by, the United States argued that nuclear and chemical weapons in the hands of an unpredictable and perhaps unstable individual like Hussein met the international [*23] law test for use of force as laid out by the Caroline case. n114 The United States argued that it could not wait until the actual use of these weapons before acting. n115 The Bush administration consistently expressed the additional concern that Hussein might provide such weapons to terrorist groups with designs on the United States. n116 Even though Hussein was not complying with U.N. resolutions, the Security Council refused to hold his &quot;feet to the fire.&quot; n117 Under this scenario, the United States felt it had no other choice than to exercise the use of force without Security Council approval. The United States was probably correct in making a distinction between the moral characters of each of the individuals and entities possessing weapons of mass destruction. Hussein's prior history of unpredictability and willingness to use chemical weapons on his own people n118 made the present situation unlike any the United States had ever faced, including the Soviet Union's threat during the Cold War years. Given this history and the lethal nature of the weapons Hussein was believed to have been developing, and the weapons' potential to wreak great devastation and suffering upon large numbers of people with little or no warning, the United States' action probably did meet the legal formulation for anticipatory self-defense set out by the Caroline case. n119 Unfortunately, in mid-2003, news sources revealed that much of the intelligence used to support the argument that Hussein was pursuing development of weapons of mass destruction was weak at best and totally fabricated at worst. n120 It also did not help that the U.S. military, after victory in Iraq and [*24] with total control of its territory, could not find any evidence of weapons of mass destruction. n121 This state of affairs demonstrates the danger of expanding the limits of the Caroline doctrine of anticipatory self-defense. False or inaccurate intelligence could easily lead to a justification for a use of force that might not otherwise exist. It is precisely this kind of miscalculation and potential for abuse that has led international actors and commentators to seek severe limits on the use of the customary law of anticipatory self-defense as provided for in the Caroline case. n122 United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has most recently joined in this chorus by arguing that the preemptive use of force, like that used by the United States against Iraq, has opened the door to establishing a dangerous precedent that will result &quot;in a proliferation of the unilateral and lawless use of force, with or without justification.&quot; n123 Nevertheless, his September 23, 2003, address to the General Assembly seemed to concede that terrorist groups or rogue states &quot;armed with weapons of mass destruction&quot; did pose a new kind of threat to international peace. n124 Annan implied, however, that this is a threat that must be met by the Security Council under the Chapter VII enforcement powers of the U.N. Charter and not by unilateral acts of individual states. n125 Annan challenged Security Council members to create new procedures that would provide &quot;for an early authorization of coercive measures to address [these new] threats&quot; and thereby neutralize arguments like those made by the United States for the unilateral use of force. n126 Failure to act, he warned, would lead to a harsh judgment by history, [*25] and he punctuated the importance of the work to be done by noting that &quot;this may be a moment no less decisive than 1945 itself, when the United Nations was founded.&quot; n127 Conclusion The war in Iraq serves as a reminder that even in this post-Cold War age of unprecedented international cooperation, the United Nations, and the Security Council specifically, is capable of failure in its efforts to avoid breaches of the peace in our global community. That does not mean that we should abandon the hope for success that we have placed in such international organizations. On the contrary, the international community of states should rely upon them even more heavily, reforming them when necessary to meet new and emerging challenges. As the world becomes a more dangerous place, nation states must learn to cooperate with each other more fully. No one state, even the sole remaining superpower, can hope to police all areas of the world at all times. The United States, with all its advantages in technology and power, must still rely upon the eyes and ears of states and other international actors for assistance. The world has moved into a new era of extreme danger - a world that can no longer assume that weapons of mass destruction will remain in the hands of rational-thinking governments and rational-thinking individuals. The availability of such weapons and their possession by individuals like Saddam Hussein has forced the United States to stretch the limits of the customary law of anticipatory self-defense to its logical extreme. Unfortunately, this sets a new precedent for other nations to follow, and puts a hair trigger on the international law doctrine of anticipatory self-defense. n128 As a result of our actions, justification for the use of force has now become much easier to establish and much more open to abuse or mistake. n129 [*26] This new and more dangerous world places a greater burden upon members of the international community to act more diligently in cooperating with each other, for even a small miscalculation could have devastating consequences for millions of people. This state of world affairs should give the United States and other nations of the world an incentive to reevaluate the definition of &quot;national interest.&quot; n130 The Bush administration acted against the will of many of the United States' fellow members on the Security Council because of perceived threats to its existence - threats against its national interest. Opposing states saw the unilateralism of the last remaining superpower as a threat to their sovereignty and relevance in the world. These opposing members of the Security Council saw unilateral action by the United States as a threat to their national interests. What seemed to get lost in the arguments for the protection of individual national interests was the fact that we all inhabit the same fragile planet. When it comes to preventing rogue states or international terrorists from using weapons of mass destruction, the interests of all nations must be considered because the damage done, whether environmental, economic, or physical, will not be limited to the territorial borders of any single nation. n131 In that vein, the words of a [*27] well-respected American revolutionary ring truer today than they did more than 225 years ago: &quot;We must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.&quot; n132 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Nuclear terrorism could even spark a full scale war between states. Such a war could involve the entire spectrum of nuclear conflict possibilities, ranging from a nuclear attack upon a non-nuclear state to systemwide nuclear war. How might such far reaching consequences of nuclear terrorism come about? Perhaps the most likely way would involve a terrorist nuclear assault against a state by terrorists hosted in another state. For example, consider the following scenario: Early in the 1990s, Israel and its Arab state neighbors finally stand ready to conclude a comprehensive, multilateral peace settlement. With a bilateral treaty between Israel and Egypt already many years old, only the interests of the Palestinians, as defined by the PLO, seem to have been left out. On the eve of the proposed signing of the peace agreement, half a dozen crude nuclear explosives in the one kiloton range detonate in as many Israeli cities. Public grief in Israel over the many thousand dead and maimed is matched only by the outcry for revenge. In response to the public mood, the government of Israel initiates selected strikes against terrorist strongholds in Lebanon, whereupon Lebanese Shiite forces and Syria retaliate against Israel. Before long, the entire region is ablaze, conflict has escalated to nuclear forms, and all countries of the area have suffered unprecedented destruction. Of course, such a scenario is fraught with the makings of even wider destruction. How would the United States react to the situation in the Middle East? What would be the soviet response? It is certainly conceivable that a chain reaction of interstate nuclear conflict could ensue, one that would ultimately involve the superpowers or even every nuclear weapon state on the planet. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">Further, the large number of states that became capable of building nuclear weapons over the years, but chose not to, can be reasonably well explained by the fact that most were formally allied with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Both these superpowers had strong nuclear forces and put great pressure on their allies not to build nuclear weapons. Since the Cold War, the US has retained all its allies. In addition, NATO has extended its protection to some of the previous allies of the Soviet Union and plans on taking in more. Nuclear proliferation by India and Pakistan, and proliferation programmes by North Korea, Iran and Iraq, all involve states in the opposite situation: all judged that they faced serious military opposition and had little prospect of establishing a reliable supporting alliance with a suitably strong, nuclear-armed state. What would await the world if strong protectors, especially the United States, were [was] no longer seen as willing to protect states from nuclear-backed aggression? At least a few additional states would begin to build their own nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them to distant targets, and these initiatives would spur increasing numbers of the world’s capable states to follow suit. Restraint would seem ever less necessary and ever more dangerous. Meanwhile, more states are becoming capable of building nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. Many, perhaps most, of the world’s states are becoming sufficiently wealthy, and the technology for building nuclear forces continues to improve and spread. Finally, it seems highly likely that at some point, halting proliferation will come to be seen as a lost cause and the restraints on it will disappear. Once that happens, the transition to a highly proliferated world would probably be very rapid. While some regions might be able to hold the line for a time, the threats posed by wildfire proliferation in most other areas could create pressures that would finally overcome all restraint. Many readers are probably willing to accept that nuclear proliferation is such a grave threat to world peace that every effort should be made to avoid it. However, every effort has not been made in the past, and we are talking about much more substantial efforts now. For new and substantially more burdensome efforts to be made to slow or stop nuclear proliferation, it needs to be established that the highly proliferated nuclear world that would sooner or later evolve without such efforts is not going to be acceptable. And, for many reasons, it is not. First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous. Proliferating states will feel great pressures to obtain nuclear weapons and delivery systems before any potential opponent does. Those who succeed in outracing an opponent may consider preemptive nuclear war before the opponent becomes capable of nuclear retaliation. Those who lag behind might try to preempt their opponent’s nuclear programme or defeat the opponent using conventional forces. And those who feel threatened but are incapable of building nuclear weapons may still be able to join in this arms race by building other types of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological weapons. Second, as the world approaches complete proliferation, the hazards posed by nuclear weapons today will be magnified many times over. Fifty or more nations capable of launching nuclear weapons means that the risk of nuclear accidents that could cause serious damage not only to their own populations and environments, but those of others, is hugely increased. The chances of such weapons failing into the hands of renegade military units or terrorists is far greater, as is the number of nations carrying out hazardous manufacturing and storage activities. Worse still, in a highly proliferated world there would be more frequent opportunities for the use of nuclear weapons. And more frequent opportunities means shorter expected times between conflicts in which nuclear weapons get used, unless the probability of use at any opportunity is actually zero. To be sure, some theorists on nuclear deterrence appear to think that in any confrontation between two states known to have reliable nuclear capabilities, the probability of nuclear weapons being used is zero.’ These theorists think that such states will be so fearful of escalation to nuclear war that they would always avoid or terminate confrontations between them, short of even conventional war. They believe this to be true even if the two states have different cultures or leaders with very eccentric personalities. History and human nature, however, suggest that they are almost surely wrong. History includes instances in which states ‘known to possess nuclear weapons did engage in direct conventional conflict. China and Russia fought battles along their common border even after both had nuclear weapons. Moreover, logic suggests that if states with nuclear weapons always avoided conflict with one another, surely states without nuclear weapons would avoid conflict with states that had them. Again, history provides counter-examples Egypt attacked Israel in 1973 even though it saw Israel as a nuclear power at the time. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands and fought Britain’s efforts to take them back, even though Britain had nuclear weapons. Those who claim that two states with reliable nuclear capabilities to devastate each other will not engage in conventional conflict risking nuclear war also assume that any leader from any culture would not choose suicide for his nation. But history provides unhappy examples of states whose leaders were ready to choose suicide for themselves and their fellow citizens. Hitler tried to impose a ‘victory or destruction’’ policy on his people as Nazi Germany was going down to defeat. And Japan’s war minister, during debates on how to respond to the American atomic bombing, suggested ‘Would it not be wondrous for the whole nation to be destroyed like a beautiful flower?” If leaders are willing to engage in conflict with nuclear-armed nations, use of nuclear weapons in any particular instance may not be likely, but its probability would still be dangerously significant. In particular, human nature suggests that the threat of retaliation with nuclear weapons is not a reliable guarantee against a disastrous first use of these weapons. While national leaders and their advisors everywhere are usually talented and experienced people, even their most important decisions cannot be counted on to be the product of well-informed and thorough assessments of all options from all relevant points of view. This is especially so when the stakes are so large as to defy assessment and there are substantial pressures to act quickly, as could be expected in intense and fast-moving crises between nuclear-armed states. Instead, like other human beings, national leaders can be seduced by wishful thinking. They can misinterpret the words or actions of opposing leaders. Their advisors may produce answers that they think the leader wants to hear, or coalesce around what they know is an inferior decision because the group urgently needs the confidence or the sharing of responsibility that results from settling on something. Moreover, leaders may not recognize clearly where their personal or party interests diverge from those of their citizens. Under great stress, human beings can lose their ability to think carefully. They can refuse to believe that the worst could really happen, oversimplify the problem at hand, think in terms of simplistic analogies and play hunches. The intuitive rules for how individuals should respond to insults or signs of weakness in an opponent may too readily suggest a rash course of action. Anger, fear, greed, ambition and pride can all lead to bad decisions. The desire for a decisive solution to the problem at hand may lead to an unnecessarily extreme course of action. We can almost hear the kinds of words that could flow from discussions in nuclear crises or war. ‘These people are not willing to die for this interest’. ‘No sane person would actually use such weapons’. ‘Perhaps the opponent will back down if we show him we mean business by demonstrating a willingness to use nuclear weapons’. ‘If I don’t hit them back really hard, I am going to be driven from office, if not killed’. Whether right or wrong, in the stressful atmosphere of a nuclear crisis or war, such words from others, or silently from within, might resonate too readily with a harried leader. Thus, both history and human nature suggest that nuclear deterrence can be expected to fail from time to time, and we are fortunate it has not happened yet. But the threat of nuclear war is not just a matter of a few weapons being used. It could get much worse. Once a conflict reaches the point where nuclear weapons are employed, the stresses felt by the leaderships would rise enormously. These stresses can be expected to further degrade their decision-making. The pressures to force the enemy to stop fighting or to surrender could argue for more forceful and decisive military action, which might be the right thing to do in the circumstances, but maybe not. And the horrors of the carnage already suffered may be seen as justification for visiting the most devastating punishment possible on the enemy.’ Again, history demonstrates how intense conflict can lead the combatants to escalate violence to the maximum possible levels. In the Second World War, early promises not to bomb cities soon gave way to essentially indiscriminate bombing of civilians. The war between Iran and Iraq during the 1980s led to the use of chemical weapons on both sides and exchanges of missiles against each other’s cities. And more recently, violence in the Middle East escalated in a few months from rocks and small arms to heavy weapons on one side, and from police actions to air strikes and armoured attacks on the other. Escalation of violence is also basic human nature. Once the violence starts, retaliatory exchanges of violent acts can escalate to levels unimagined by the participants before hand. Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse. And such anger can lead us to impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible. In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possible with the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild West of the late 1800s. With most, if not all, nations wearing nuclear 'six-shooters' on their hips, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">To resolve such problems, it may be necessary to establish new rules that are binding on all subjects of international law regardless of the attitude of any particular state. For unless all states are bound, an exempted recalcitrant state could act as a spoiler for the entire international community. Thus, states that are not bound by international laws designed to combat universal environmental threats could become havens for the harmful activities concerned. Such states might have an economic advantage over states that are bound because they would not have to bear the costs of the requisite environmental protection. They would be free riders on the system and would benefit from the environmentally protective measures introduced by others at some cost. Furthermore, the example of such free riders might undermine the system by encouraging other states not to participate, and could thus derail the entire effort. Similarly, in the case of international terrorism, one state that serves as a safe haven for terrorists can threaten all. War crimes, apartheid or genocide committed in one state might threaten international peace and security worldwide. Consequently, for certain circumstances it may be incumbent on the international community to establish international law that is binding on all states regardless of any one state's disposition. Unfortunately, the traditions of the international legal system appear to work against the ability to legislate universal norms. States are said to be sovereign, thus able to determine for themselves what they must or may do. State autonomy continues to serve the international system well in traditional spheres of international relations. The freedom of states to control their own destinies and policies has substantial value: it permits diversity and the choice by each state of its own social priorities. Few, if any, states favor a world government that would dictate uniform behavior for all. Consequently, many writers use the language of autonomy when they declare that international law requires the consent of the states that are governed by it. Many take the position that a state that does not wish to be bound by a new rule of international law may object to it and be exempted from its application. If sovereignty and autonomy prevailed in all areas of international law, however, one could hardly hope to develop rules to bind all states. In a community of nearly two hundred diverse states, it is virtually impossible to obtain the acceptance of all to any norm, particularly one that requires significant expenses or changes in behavior. Complete autonomy may have been acceptable in the past when no state could take actions that would threaten the international community as a whole. Today, the enormous destructive potential of some activities and the precarious condition of some objects of international concern make full autonomy undesirable, if not potentially catastrophic. In this article I explore the limits of state autonomy to determine whether some or all of international law may be made universally binding regardless of the position of one or a small number of unwilling states. To accomplish this objective, I begin by analyzing the secondary rules of recognition (the doctrine of sources) used to establish primary rules of international law. While treaties may require the consent of individual states to be binding on them, such consent is not required for customary norms. Finally, I explore in greater depth the actual processes by which many customary law norms have come into being in the last half of the twentieth century. The contemporary process that is often used is significantly different from that described in the classic treatises on the formation of customary law. Contemporary procedural developments place the international legal system closer to the more formal notions of positive law, facilitating the development of universal international law. These procedural developments strengthen the argument that the system may establish general international law binding on all states, regardless of the objection of a small number of states. Like many others, I take the position that there exists an international legal system with standards and procedures for making, applying and enforcing international law. n6 As a jurisprudential matter, the source of the obligation to abide by international law is a matter of debate. Perhaps the most popular theory is that states become bound to the international legal system on the basis of a social contract, actual consent or tacit consent. n7 Other theories dispense with consent as the source of a state's obligation to abide by international law. The principal ones maintain (1) that natural law imposes a duty on those located within the territorial scope of the legal system to abide by it, especially when it is legitimate and just; n8 (2) that principles of fair play or gratitude bind those who benefit from the legal system to abide by its rules; n9 and (3) that utilitarian considerations based on the value of the rule or of the system to individuals obligate them to abide by the law. n10 Depending upon the theory, the consent of states may or may not be found at the root of all international law. Be that as it may, the system of international law serves the practical interests of states. As is true of all societies, the international community has a need for rules to impart a degree of order, predictability and stability to relations among its members. The rules of the system also permit members to avoid conflict and injury, and promote beneficial reciprocal and cooperative relations. They may even promote values of justice and morality. The international legal system is supported not only by states' interests in promoting individual rules, but also by their interests in preserving and promoting the system as a whole. Thus, states collectively and severally maintain an interest in encouraging law-abiding behavior. There is also an effective decentralized system for imposing sanctions on violators of the law through individual state and collective acts of disapproval, denial and penalties. Fear of sanctions, the desire to be viewed by others as law-abiding, and domestic institutional inclinations to conform to rules denominated as law further impel states to comply with international law. Despite the decentralized nature of the international legal system, there are strong reasons why states need international law and are compelled to abide by it. Its decentralized structure places some limits on what can be accomplished, but within those limits international law has an important role. Even though individual states may find short-term advantages in violating the law in particular situations, their long-term interests are likely to be served best by the system. Because the decentralized international legal system is governed directly by the subjects of the law, i.e., states, it inherently favors rules of law that optimize the interests of states. Despite the differences in power and influence of states, no individual or small group of states is now dominant. Decisions tend to reflect the power relationships and the right of all states to participate in reaching them. When the lawmakers themselves are the primary subjects of the law, the law should reflect their collective interests. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Similarly, the oxymoronic concept of &quot;imposed democracy&quot; authorizes top-down regime change in the name of democracy. Yet the United States has always argued that genuine democracy must flow from the will of the people, not from military occupation. 67 Finally, a policy of strategic unilateralism seems unsustainable in an interdependent world. For over the past two centuries, the United States has become party not just to a few treaties, but to a global network of closely interconnected treaties enmeshed in multiple frameworks of international institutions. Unilateral administration decisions to break or bend one treaty commitment thus rarely end the matter, but more usually trigger vicious cycles of treaty violation. In an interdependent world, [*1501] the United States simply cannot afford to ignore its treaty obligations while at the same time expecting its treaty partners to help it solve the myriad global problems that extend far beyond any one nation's control: the global AIDS and SARS crises, climate change, international debt, drug smuggling, trade imbalances, currency coordination, and trafficking in human beings, to name just a few. Repeated incidents of American treaty-breaking create the damaging impression of a United States contemptuous of both its treaty obligations and treaty partners. That impression undermines American soft power at the exact moment that the United States is trying to use that soft power to mobilize those same partners to help it solve problems it simply cannot solve alone: most obviously, the war against global terrorism, but also the postwar construction of Iraq, the Middle East crisis, or the renewed nuclear militarization of North Korea. </span><br />

Great suffering still occurs in so many parts of the world, not just from internal armed conflicts,[113] but also from conditions of poverty.[114] There are severe health problems in much of the world which can be mitigated with relatively little cost.[115] There are the lives lost to the AIDS epidemic, and [page 464] the deaths and disabilities caused by land mines.[116] Russia, a nuclear superpower that could end life on this planet, has severe social, economic, and political problems.[117] Making the human race important would not just promote liberal democratic values but would also reduce human suffering and perhaps eliminate completely the risk of nuclear war. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Expressing disapproval with some Obama administration actions, many on the right — and some on the left — are complaining that the executive branch wields far too much power. Similarly, when President George W. Bush was in power, many on the left — and some on the right — complained that the executive branch wielded far too much power. Seeing this bipartisan concern for unbridled expansion of presidential power and wishing to start restoring the office to its Constitutional limits, Congressman Geoff Davis (R-KY) has introduced the Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act. The REINS Act would require Congressional authorization for any new Major Rule proposed by the executive branch. It now has now has 57 cosponsors, including noted Constitutionalist Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX). It also enjoys the support of the Chamber of Commerce. Under REINS, the numerous proposed regulations pertaining to health care, climate change, energy, financial regulation, and our economy would have to be submitted to Congress for approval. REINS would continue to allow the executive agencies charged with writing rules to propose draft rules, but would end the delegation of Congressional authority that has enabled these agencies to enact them unilaterally. Our Founding Fathers recognized the pitfalls of an all-powerful chief executive. Fearing tyranny, our nation did not even have a president until 1789, preferring instead strong states, a weak Congress operating under the auspices of the Articles of Confederation, and no executive branch at all. As this proved to be too weak for national cohesiveness, our founders drafted the Constitution to provide the nation with three co-equal branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial. All three were to operate within the limits defined by the Constitution. Our founders took great care in limiting presidential power. Presidential power is limited to the powers granted by Article II of the Constitution. As further protection against tyranny, our founders created a system where the president is chosen by the Electoral College rather than via direct election. This was partly to keep the president from exceeding the authority granted by the Constitution by claiming a popular mandate. The Constitutional system kept presidential power largely in check (temporary wartime expansions under President Lincoln and President Wilson being very notable exceptions) until the election of President Franklin Roosevelt. President Roosevelt greatly expanded the power of both the presidency and the entire federal government. He was the first president to submit legislation directly to Congress. When much of this was overturned by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional, FDR reacted by bullying the Court with threats to pack it with New Deal supporters. Once the Court started upholding New Deal legislation, FDR used this green light to expand the office of the presidency well beyond its Constitutional bounds, shifting federal power from Congress and the Supreme Court to the executive branch in the process. Most presidents since FDR have sought to further expand the power of the office. President Obama has continued this expansion of executive power. He has given a great amount of power to unelected bureaucrats within the executive branch and has then, in effect, created law via the regulatory process. No Congressional approval was sought for any of these actions. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The sweeping authority that Nixon claimed in theory, George W. Bush has acted on again and again. The preemptive attack on Iraq was the most visible of his presidency’s actions resting on that claim— actions we can’t fully count because so many have been undertaken in secret. This pattern has made the issues of presidential power and the separation of powers as important today as they have ever been. From 2003 through 2006, when the Republicans occupied the White House, controlled both houses of Congress, and held sway on the Supreme Court— and, really, since the administration came to power in 2001— there was little checking and balancing. Instead of ensuring that the executive branch was properly enforcing the law— holding meaningful hearings about Abu Ghraib, for example, or about the detention of enemy combatants— Congress often acted like an extension of the White House. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">In each of the historical examples just given, the judiciary ultimately played a critical role in evaluating the legality of executive action. In the Civil War case, Lambdin Milligan, who had led armed uprisings against Union forces in Indiana, appealed his military tribunal prosecution to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Ex Parte Milligan (1865), the U.S. Supreme Court held Milligan's military prosecution unconstitutional, holding that as long as the civilian &quot;courts are open and their process unobstructed, . . . they can never be applied to civilians in states which have upheld the authority of the government.&quot; In Ex Parte Quirin (1942), the Supreme Court reviewed the military prosecution of the German army spies for violations of the laws of war and concluded that it was within the executive's power. Unlike the civilian subject to military justice in Ex Parte Milligan, the Quirin defendants were members of the army of a nation with which the United States was in declared war. And critically, Congress had expressly authorized military commission trials for the offenses for which they were accused. The Supreme Court likewise upheld the exclusion of Japanese-Americans from their homes in Korematsu v. United States (1944), explaining: &quot;Korematsu was not excluded from the military area because of hostility to him or his race. He was excluded because we are at war with the Japanese Empire, because the properly constituted military authorities feared an invasion of our West Coast and felt constrained to take proper security measures, and finally, because Congress, reposing its confidence in this time of war in our military leaders - as inevitably it must - determined that they should have the power to do just this.&quot; As these examples demonstrate, the U.S. Supreme Court has not always acted to enforce positive legal protections in favor of the individual against the government's exercise of 'wartime' power. Nonetheless, the Court's structural involvement conveyed a critical political message that executive power remained subject to the rule of law. In addition, the Court's published majority opinions clarified the nature of the executive action taken in response to perceived wartime threats, providing a basis for comparative analysis of subsequent executive conduct. In vigorous and public dissenting opinions accompanying each decision, minority justices gave expression to the strong opposing arguments on the resolution of the legal questions presented. Perhaps most important, the judicial decisions provided Congress, legal scholars, and the American public a means for understanding and, in the relative calm of post-war decision-making, for reevaluating the political wisdom of the challenged actions. Thus, for example, a federal court eventually granted a writ of coram nobis in Mr. Korematsu's case as a result of executive misrepresentations. (Korematsu v. United States (N.D. Cal. 1984)). In 1971, to rein in what was by then broadly recognized as executive excesses, Congress passed 18 U.S.C. § 4001(a), providing: &quot;No citizen shall be . . . detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.&quot; And in 1988, Congress awarded reparations to the remaining survivors and descendants of those interned during World War II as a result of the military exclusion order. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Many of the newly independent governments that have proliferated over the past five decades have adopted these Council of Europe doc. They have emerged from a variety of less-than-free contexts, including the end of European colonial rule in the 1950’s and 1960’s, the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the former Soviet Union in the late 1980’s and 1990’s, the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and the continu- ing turmoil in parts of Africa, Latin America and southern Asia. Some countries have successfully transitioned to sta- ble and democratic forms of government that protect indi- vidual freedoms and human rights by means of judicial review by a strong and independent judiciary. Others have suffered the rise of tyrannical and oppressive rulers who consolidated their hold on power in part by diminishing or abolishing the role of the judiciary. And still others hang in the balance, struggling against the onslaught of tyrants to establish stable, democratic governments. In their attempts to shed their tyrannical pasts and to ensure the protection of individual rights, emerging democracies have consistently looked to the United States and its Constitution in fashioning frameworks that safe- guard the independence of their judiciaries. See Ran Hirschl, The Political Origins of Judicial Empowerment through Constitutionalization: Lessons from Four Consti- tutional Revolutions, 25 LAW &amp; S OC. I NQUIRY 91, 92 (2000) (stating that of the “[m]any countries . . . [that] have engaged in fundamental constitutional reform over the past three decades,” nearly all adopted “a bill of rights and establishe[d] some form of active judicial review”). Estab- lishing judicial review by a strong and independent judici- ary is a critical step in stabilizing and protecting these new democracies. See Christopher M. Larkins, Judicial Inde- pendence and Democratization: A Theoretical and Concep- tual Analysis, 44 AM. J. COMP.

Although the precise form of government differs among countries, “they ultimately constitute variations within, not from, the American model of constitutionalism . . .

J. COMP. L. 707, 718 (2001). This phenomenon became most notable worldwide after World War II when certain countries, such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, embraced independent judiciaries follow- ing their bitter experiences under totalitarian regimes. See id. at 714-15; see also United States v. Then, 56 F.3d 464, 469 (2d Cir. 1995) (Calabresi, J., concurring) (“Since World War II, many countries have adopted forms of judi- cial review, which—though different from ours in many particulars—unmistakably draw their origin and inspira- tion from American constitutional theory and practice. See generally Mauro Cappelletti, The Judicial Process in Com- 24 parative Perspective (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989).”). It is a trend that continues to this day. It bears mention that the United States has consistently affirmed and encouraged the establishment of independent judiciaries in emerging democracies. In September 2000, President Clinton observed that “[w]ithout the rule of law, elections simply offer a choice of dictators. . . .

The United States acts on these principles in part through the assistance it provides to developing nations. For example, the United States requires that any country seeking assistance through the Millenium Chal- lenge Account, a development assistance program institut- ed in 2002, must demonstrate, among other criteria, an “adherence to the rule of law.” The White House noted that the rule of law is one of the “essential conditions for suc- cessful development” of these countries.

It has, for example, conditioned the continuation of trade benefits to certain countries where the protection of human rights has come into doubt, such as Swaziland, on their maintenance of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.

B. Other Nations Have Curtailed Judicial Review During Times Of Crisis, Often Citing the Unit- ed States’ Example, And Individual Freedoms Have Diminished As A Result. While much of the world is moving to adopt the institu- tions necessary to secure individual rights, many still reg- ularly abuse these rights. One of the hallmarks of tyranny is the lack of a strong and independent judiciary. Not sur- prisingly, where countries make the sad transition to tyran- ny, one of the first victims is the judiciary. Many of the rulers that go down that road justify their actions on the basis of national security and the fight against terrorism, and, disturbingly, many claim to be modeling their actions on the United States. 27 Again, a few examples illustrate this trend. In Peru, one of former President Alberto Fujimori’s first acts in seizing control was to assume direct executive control of the judi- ciary, claiming that it was justified by the threat of domes- tic terrorism. He then imprisoned thousands, refusing the right of the judiciary to intervene.

While Peru and Zimbabwe represent an extreme, the independence of the judiciary is under assault in less brazen ways in a variety of countries today. A highly trou- bling aspect of this trend is the fact that in many of these instances those perpetuating the assaults on the judiciary have pointed to the United States’ model to justify their actions. Indeed, many have specifically referenced the United States’ actions in detaining persons in Guantánamo Bay. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Lang's embarrassment highlights two common, and often mistaken, assumptions -- that the forces of democracy are the forces of ethnic harmony and of peace. Neither is necessarily true. Mature liberal democracies can usually accommodate ethnic divisions without violence or terror and live in peace with other liberal democracies. But without a background in constitutional liberalism, the introduction of democracy in divided societies has actually fomented nationalism, ethnic conflict, and even war. The spate of elections held immediately after the collapse of communism were won in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia by nationalist separatists and resulted in the breakup of those countries. This was not in and of itself bad, since those countries had been bound together by force. But the rapid secessions, without guarantees, institutions, or political power for the many minorities living within the new countries, have caused spirals of rebellion, repression, and, in places like Bosnia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, war. Elections require that politicians compete for peoples' votes. In societies without strong traditions of multiethnic groups or assimilation, it is easiest to organize support along racial, ethnic, or religious lines. Once an ethnic group is in power, it tends to exclude other ethnic groups. Compromise seems impossible; one can bargain on material issues like housing, hospitals, and handouts, but how does one split the difference on a national religion? Political competition that is so divisive can rapidly degenerate into violence. Opposition movements, armed rebellions, and coups in Africa have often been directed against ethnically based regimes, many of which came to power through elections. Surveying the breakdown of African and Asian democracies in the 1960s, two scholars concluded that democracy &quot;is simply not viable in an environment of intense ethnic preferences.&quot; Recent studies, particularly of Africa and Central Asia, have confirmed this pessimism. A distinguished expert on ethnic conflict, Donald Horowitz, concluded, &quot;In the face of this rather dismal account . . . of the concrete failures of democracy in divided societies . . . one is tempted to throw up o ne's hands. What is the point of holding elections if all they do in the end is to substitute a Bemba-dominated regime for a Nyanja regime in Zambia, the two equally narrow, or a southern regime for a northern one in Benin, neither incorporating the other half of the state?&quot; Over the past decade, one of the most spirited debates among scholars of international relations concerns the &quot;democratic peace&quot; -- the assertion that no two modern democracies have gone to war with each other. The debate raises interesting substantive questions (does the American Civil War count? do nuclear weapons better explain the peace?) and even the statistical findings have raised interesting dissents. (As the scholar David Spiro points out, given the small number of both democracies and wars over the last two hundred years, sheer chance might explain the absence of war between democracies. No member of his family has ever won the lottery, yet few offer explanations for this impressive correlation.) But even if the statistics are correct, what explains them? Kant, the original proponent of the democratic peace, contended that in democracies, those who pay for wars -- that is, the public -- make the decisions, so they are understandably cautious. But that claim suggests that democracies are more pacific than other states. Actually they are more warlike, going to war more often and with greater intensity than most states. It is only with other democracies that the peace holds. When divining the cause behind this correlation, one thing becomes clear: the democratic peace is actually the liberal peace. Writing in the eighteenth century, Kant believed that democracies were tyrannical, and he specifically excluded them from his conception of &quot;republican&quot; governments, which lived in a zone o f peace. Republicanism, for Kant, meant a separation of powers, checks and balances, the rule of law, protection of individual rights, and some level of representation in government (though nothing close to universal suffrage). Kant's other explanations fo r the &quot;perpetual peace&quot; between republics are all closely linked to their constitutional and liberal character: a mutual respect for the rights of each other's citizens, a system of checks and balances assuring that no single leader can drag his country into war, and classical liberal economic policies -- most importantly, free trade - - which create an interdependence that makes war costly and cooperation useful. Michael Doyle, the leading scholar on the subject, confirms in his 1997 book Ways of War and Peace that without constitutional liberalism, democracy itself has no peace-inducing qualities: Kant distrusted unfettered, democratic majoritarianism, and his argument offersno support for a claim that all participatory polities -- democracies -- should be peaceful, either in general or between fellow democracies. Many participatory polities have been non-liberal. For two thousand years before the modern age, popular rule was widely associated with aggressiveness (by Thucydides) or imperial success (by Machiavelli) . . . The decisive preference of [the] median voter might well include &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; against other democratic polities. The distinction between liberal and illiberal democracies sheds light on another striking statistical correlation. Political scientists Jack Snyder and Edward Mansfield contend, using an impressive data set, that over the last 200 years democratizing states went to war significantly more often than either stable autocracies or liberal democracies. In countries not grounded in constitutional liberalism, the rise of democracy often brings with it hypernationalism and war -mongering. When the political system is opened up, diverse groups with incompatible interests gain access to power and press their demands. Political and military leaders, who are often embattled remnants of the old authoritarian order, realize that to succeed that they must rally the masses behind a national cause. The result is invariably aggressive rhetoric and policies, which often drag countries into confrontation and war. Noteworthy examples range from Napoleon III's France, Wilhelmine Germany, and Taisho Japan to those in today's newspapers , like Armenia and Azerbaijan and Milosevic's Serbia. The democratic peace, it turns out, has little to do with democracy. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">There are three bases for this claim. The first goes back to the questions raised earlier about the validity of the common assumption by major outside powers like the United States that their interests are better served by waiting to see if the conflict will subside, not spread, or otherwise self-contain. If it were the case that the fires of ethnic conflicts, however intense, would just burn upon themselves, and not have significant potential to spread regionally or destabilize more systematically, then in strict realist terms one could argue that major powers could afford to just let them be. The Bosnia experience, though, particularly belies the realism of this assumption. Moreover, as Lake and Rothchild and other authors in their volume delineate in their articles, there is substantial analytic and theoretical basis for concluding that Bosnia is not an exception, and that the risks of both diffusion and escalation of ethnic conflicts are quite substantial. There may be direct contagion through the actual physical movement of people and weapons, and/or demonstration effects (Kuran), and/or other modes of diffusion. There also may be the horizontal escalation of drawing in outside powers, even if not as direct combatants, which can have damaging effects on their overall relations and thus reverberate through the international system. This is why the UN and regional multilateral organizations have been increasing emphasis on regional security both in an absolute sense and also relative to the humanitarian rationale as the basis for sovereignty abridging intermediations and intervention. </span><br />

Many analysts see U.S.-Japan efforts on missile defense as perhaps the most robust form of bilateral cooperation in recent years. In December 2003, Koizumi announced that Japan would jointly develop and deploy missile defense capabilities with the United States. Similar to and interoperable with U.S. missile plans, Japan will acquire upper and lower ballistic missile defense systems, including the sea-based AEGIS combat system and an SM-3 interceptor missile. The decision has led to defense industry cooperation between Japanese and American firms. Developing the system requires that Japan improve its joint operations capability and upgrade its command and control networks to allow timely decisions. Further cooperation will require that Japan lift or relax its ban on exporting arms, as Japanese defense officials have urged in order to further develop U.S.-Japan research and development coordination. The test-launch of several missiles by North Korea in July 2006 accelerated plans to develop missile defense. In December 2007, the missile defense program got a boost when a Japanese destroyer successfully intercepted a missile in a test exercise near Hawaii. Japan mobilized its land- and sea-based missile defense systems for the first time in response to the North Korean missile tests in April 2009. The “2+2” proposals envisage greater integration of the U.S. and Japanese militaries, and several of the areas mentioned will depend on the success of efforts to make the forces more interoperable. A bilateral coordination center at Yokota Air Base will focus on missile defense cooperation, while a new SDF “Central Readiness Force Command” will be established at Camp Zama to create a joint operations facility with the U.S. Army command. The co-located headquarters, due to be completed by 2012, are anticipated to facilitate both greater U.S.-Japan cooperation as well as overall SDF “jointness.” As part of its effort to improve its own capability as well as work more closely with U.S. forces, Japan has created a joint staff office that puts all the ground, maritime, and air self-defense forces under a single command. Under the previous organization, a joint command was authorized only if operations required multiple service participation, which had never occurred in the SDF’s history. In July 2005, an amendment was made to the law establishing the SDF that required the Joint Chief of Staff to counsel Japan’s defense chief on all SDF operational matters and that all military orders will be given through the JCS in both peacetime and during contingencies. The need for smoother coordination with the U.S. joint command was one of the primary reasons for adopting the new organization.12 The 1997 guidelines outlined rear-area support roles that Japanese forces could play to assist U.S. operations the event of a conflict in areas surrounding Japan. The passage of special legislation since 2001 has allowed Japanese forces to take on roles in Iraq and in the Indian Ocean under the category of international peace cooperation activities. Further, SDF participation in operations has led to substantial interaction and cooperation with U.S. forces, from logistics training in Kuwait before dispatching to Iraq to working together on disaster relief operations following the December 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Bilateral interoperability was also tested in JuneJuly 2006 as North Korea was preparing to test-launch a missile. Ballistic missile defense coordination was carried out again under real threat circumstances during the 2009 North Korean missile launches.<br />

It was North Korea's Taepodong-1 ballistic missile test in August 1998 that persuaded Tokyo to join with Washington in cooperative research and development of a ballistic missile defense system and subsequent deployment. Responding to the test, Japan and the United States agreed to begin a joint technology study of the Navy Theater Wide Defense in September 1998. In the past 8 years, U.S. — Japan missile defense cooperation has been significantly enhanced given increasing North Korea's nuclear and missile threats and the Bush administration's support for missile defense. Tokyo accelerated deployment of missile defense, integrating it with the U.S. missile defense system. Many Japanese government officials believe that establishing a robust missile defense system is the best course of action to protect the country from missiles that might be launched by North Korea. Tokyo considers that the defensive nature of such a system does not contradict Japan's &quot;exclusively defensive defense&quot; policy. Under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, Japan officially decided to deploy missile defenses in collaboration with the United States. Coinciding with the Bush Administration's tenure, the Koizumi administration (2001 - 2006), followed the same direction as the U.S. administration that made missile defense a cornerstone of its national security. While concerns and controversies remain both inside and outside Japan, deploying a missile defense system has come to be perceived as a more realistic option than more overtly offensive ones in responding to regional threats, particularly North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The Japanese government officially decided to acquire ballistic missile defense capabilities on 19 December 2003, issuing the cabinet decision &quot;On Introduction of Ballistic Missile Defense System and other measures&quot;.[1] To implement the new agenda laid out in this Cabinet decision, the Japanese government approved the National Defense Program Guidelines in and after JFY 2005 and Mid-Term Defense Program (JFY 2005-2009) in December 2004. The Guidelines endorsed the development of missile defense, and implied that the Three Principles on Arms Export and provisions related thereto could be further modified as necessary for the BMD deployment. The Three Principles had previously barred the Japanese government from jointly developing and producing weapons as well as transferring weapons parts to any foreign countries, including the United States. On 24 December 2005, the Japanese cabinet decided that Japan would jointly develop more advanced next-generation missile interceptors with the United States. Then Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe reiterated that the Three Principles would not apply to U.S.-Japan missile defense cooperation.[2] The Japanese government steadily adopted these decisions in order to be ready for the actual deployment of BMD systems. In response to North Korea's missile launches in July 2006 and its nuclear test in October the same year, Japan accelerated its missile defense deployment schedule and the first Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC) 3 ballistic missile interceptors were deployed at Iruma Airbase in Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo, in March 2007.[3] Current Capabilities Japan has deployed a multi-layered missile defense system consisting of sea-based mid-course missile defense (the Aegis BMD system) and ground-based terminal phase systems (PAC-3). With the accelerated process, PAC-3 installment in the Tokyo Metropolitan area was completed in March 2008. By March 2011, PAC-3 missiles will be deployed with 16 fire units around Japan's major cities. So far, PAC-3 systems have been deployed in 7 sites. [4] Moreover, Japan conducted its first test-firing of the PAC-3 interceptor at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico on 17 September 2008. At the test, Japan's Air Self-Defense Force successfully shot down a mock ballistic missile.[5] Aegis BMD features the Standard Missile 3 (SM-3), a three-stage missile with a range of 1000 km that is said to be capable of intercepting missiles up to an altitude of 200 km or higher. The SM-3 block I-A missile is designed to intercept ballistic missiles in outer space during mid-course flight, and with Aegis BMD, it can intercept a short to intermediate range ballistic missile. A milestone in U.S.-Japan missile defense cooperation occurred when Japan became the first country other than the United States to succeed in intercepting a mock missile with the Aegis system. On 18 December 2007, a Japanese Aegis guided missile destroyer, Kongo, intercepted and destroyed a ballistic missile target in space for the first time. The flight test was conducted in cooperation with the United States Missile Defense agency.[6] After the series of successful tests, the failure of the second Aegis missile defense test off Kauai, Hawaii in November 2008, however, disappointed both U.S. and Japanese missile defense proponents.[7] Despite the mixed results, Japan's Ministry of Defense plans to deploy four Aegis-equipped destroyers armed with SM-3s by March 2011. The current Japanese missile defense system is designed to shoot down medium range missiles such as the Nodong within the range of 1000 km with the SM-3. Japan does not yet have the capability to intercept a Taepodong type missile of which the range is more than 6000 km. However, currently, the Japanese and U.S. governments are jointly developing an advanced version of the SM-3 Block II-A missile to improve its defensive capabilities against longer-range missiles, such as the Taepodong. The new SM-3 is scheduled to be available by 2014.[8] Japan and the United States have been also discussing deployment of Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) since 2005. Deployment of this system, however, is unlikely to happen before 2011-2012 due to financial constraints<br />

<br />
I. Current Chinese Nuclear Policy It can be safely said that of all the nuclear states, the nuclear policy of China has so far been the most consistent. From the day China first exploded an atomic bomb, its nuclear policy-related statements have remained unchanged. Five major components can be derived from these statements: No First Use Policy No first use (NFU) has been most frequently and consistently repeated in numerous Chinese government statements ever since China became a nuclear weapon state in 1964. By conceding the first use option, China has limited itself to retaliatory nuclear use only. China has also called all nuclear weapon states to commit themselves to a NFU policy at any time and in any circumstances. Security Assurance to Non Nuclear Weapons States and Nuclear Free Zones China has been very critical of the use of nuclear threats against non-nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapons zones. It has repeatedly called on all the nuclear weapon states to agree to a legally-binding, multilateral agreement under which they would pledge not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states and nuclear free zones. This policy component limits China’s potential nuclear adversaries to just the few nuclear weapon states. Apart from the negative security assurance, which China gives unconditionally to all non-nuclear weapon states, China issued its first formal positive security assurance with the other four declared nuclear weapon states in April 1995, promising to come to the aid of any non-nuclear weapon state subject to nuclear attack and pursue appropriate punishment against the attacking state, under the auspices of the UN Security Council. This policy has become part of the UN Security Council Resolution 984. Limited Development of Second Strike, Retaliatory Capability China has repeated its intention to maintain a very small nuclear arsenal on many occasions. In its 2003 Defense White Paper, China states that it “has always exercised utmost restraint on the development of nuclear weapons, and its nuclear arsenal is kept at the lowest level necessary for self-defense only.”[1] However, to make this small arsenal a credible deterrent, China has to make it survivable to a first nuclear strike, even that strike is overwhelming and devastating. In Chinese literature, “few but effective” (jinggan youxiao) are the words most frequently used to describe its necessary arsenal. Opposition to Nuclear Deployment outside National Territories China is opposed to the policy of extended nuclear deterrence, or the policy of providing &quot;nuclear umbrellas&quot; by nuclear weapon states to their allies. In consistence with China’s long standing policy of not sending or stationing any troops outside China, it is also officially opposed to the deployment of nuclear weapons outside national territories, and has stated that China will never deployed nuclear weapons on any foreign soil. Complete Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and Thorough Nuclear Disarmament China first called for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons in its proposal for a world summit in1963, before its first nuclear explosion. On the same day of China’s first nuclear explosion, it again stated that “the Chinese government hereby solemnly proposes to the governments of the world that a summit conference of all the countries of the world be convened to discuss the questions of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and that as the first step, the summit conference conclude an agreement to the effect that the nuclear powers and those countries which may soon become nuclear powers undertake not to use nuclear weapons either against non-nuclear countries and nuclear-free zones or against each other.&quot;[2] This has evolved into China’s basic position on nuclear disarmament and it has never given up its efforts to promote an international convention to ban nuclear weapons. The above major components of Chinese nuclear policy, if interpreted through the lens of Western deterrence terminology, can be characterized as: Strategic Rather than Operational and Tactical Deterrence Mao Zedong, in elaborating China's reason to develop nuclear weapons, said “we will not only have possession of more aircraft and artillery pieces, but also atom bombs. In today’s world, we must have this thing if we don’t want to be bullied by others.”[3] The original purpose of nuclear development in China was to “break up the nuclear threat and smash the nuclear blackmail (dabuo he weixie, fensui he ezha).” As a political instrument, nuclear weapons are to be utilized mainly at the level of grand strategy, not as a winning tool in military operations. The military value of nuclear weapons lies only in its deterrent effect against nuclear attack. The officially declared missions of the Second Artillery Force are twofold: To deter the use of nuclear weapons against China, and To launch an effective nuclear counter-attack in the case of such an attack.[4] No distinction has been made in categorizing nuclear operations. A nuclear strike against China—whether conducted at strategic, operational or tactical level, with high or low yield warheads, or deadly or tolerable lethality—is perceived as the utmost form of warfare in Chinese war categorization, which must be responded strategically. In Chinese strategic literature, we only see the discussion on how to deter a nuclear war from happening, on how to prevent a conventional conflict from escalating into a nuclear war, and how to retaliate after suffering a nuclear attack—but never how to win a nuclear war. The primary Chinese perception is that nuclear wars are not to be won, but to be prevented. Retaliatory—Rather than Denial—Deterrence[5] Many Chinese cite Deng Xiaoping when explaining China's nuclear thinking. He explained, in a meeting with foreigners in 1983: &quot;While you have some deterrence force, we also have some; but we don't want much. It will do just to possess it. Things like strategic weapons and deterrence forces are there to scare others. They must not be used first. But our possession will have some effect. The limited possession of nuclear weapons itself exert some pressure. It remains our position that we will develop a little (nuclear weapons). But the development will be limited. We have said repeatedly that our small amount (of nuclear weapons) is nothing. It is only to show that we also have what you have. If you want to destroy us, you yourself have to suffer some punishment at the same time.&quot;[6] Deng’s statement echoed Mao’s nuclear thinking in several aspects: Nuclear weapons are desirable only for its deterrent value, not for battlefield utility. Nuclear weapons, if ever used, will be used to cause the enemy as much pain as possible, so as to enhance its deterrent value in the first place. Therefore, China has to adopt counter-value as opposed to counterforce targeting strategies, in order to strengthen its deterrence posture. Only a small number of nuclear weapons will satisfy China’s deterrent needs—to convince potential nuclear adversary of a possible nuclear retaliation. Both Mao and Deng are very explicit that the deterrent effectiveness does not increase in proportion with numbers of nuclear weapons. A survivable and invulnerable small arsenal can be equally effective in terms of deterrence. Deterrence effect depends on invulnerability to nuclear strikes, not on large amount of nuclear attack capabilities. Accordingly, what China has been seeking is a nuclear arsenal that is small in size but good in quality. As confined by its adherence to NFU policy, China has to focus its nuclear development efforts on “second strike capabilities” which must be credible and survivable in order to have deterrent effect. Central Rather than Extended Deterrence[7] By declaring to counter-attack with nuclear weapons only after being attacked by nuclear weapons, China has preserved nuclear capabilities to protect its own most vital interests—that is, the existence of the nation. Even during the Cold War years, China has never provided nuclear umbrella to any other country in the world. For China, the concept of extended deterrence has simply not entered into it nuclear calculus—yet. General Rather than Immediate Deterrence The mutual deterrence exercised by the two nuclear superpowers during the Cold War had been directed at one another. They were both 69the ones to deter, and the ones to be deterred. They formed a bilateral deterrent relationship, in which each side was very clear whom it wanted to deter, and what it wanted to deter them from. Their deterrence was more of an immediate nature. China had never comfortably fitted into the bipolar context. It had been in one of the poles for some time, then outside of both poles for some time, and then it tried to be closer to the other pole. In addition, China had not had the luxury of a nuclear umbrella for most of the Cold War years. Therefore, China’s nuclear deterrence had been more of a general nature—in which China tried to form a multilateral deterrent relationship with all the nuclear powers, which only made clear what China wanted to deter. Defensive Rather than Offensive Deterrence One famous tenet laid down by Chairman Mao Zedong is the Sixteen Character Guideline for the use of force—“We will never attack unless we are attacked; and if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack” (ren bu fan wo, wo bu fan ren; ren ruo fan wo, wo bi fan ren). Behind this guideline is a sober headed analysis of power balances. The PLA and its predecessors entered and won most wars as an inferior side against great odds. So a defensive posture had always been preferred to an offensive one. However, Chinese forces have managed to turn from being the weaker into the stronger party in the course—usually a protracted course—of previous conventional wars. When applied to nuclear policy, this Guideline simply means a rejection of preemptive thinking. The renunciation of the first-use option, the willingness to accept vulnerability, the confinement to retaliatory nuclear use, the principle of attacking only after being attacked (hou fa zi ren), the focus on second strike capabilities, and the reservation of nuclear means as the last resort to protect only the most vital national interests, all point to the defensiveness of China’s nuclear policy. Although nuclear weapons are inherently offensive weapons, when deterrence strategies are applied in the way China does, they acquire a pure defensive posture. Minimum Rather than Limited or Maximum Deterrence If I am to choose from Western deterrence classifications to describe Chinese nuclear deterrence posture in general, I would have to use the handy concept of “minimum deterrence” as compared to maximum or limited deterrence. Personally, I think the word “minimum” has too strong a quantitative connotation that is misleading. It sometimes suggests a quantitative standard instead of a qualitative standard. The word “minimum” has for some time been officially used in Chinese government documents.[8] But what I want to emphasize is that Chinese strategists take the concept as a relative one, defined not only by pure numbers, but more importantly by such key criteria as invulnerability of nuclear forces, assurance of retaliation, and credibility of counter-attack. When a Chinese document says that China intends to possess nuclear weapons only at the minimum (or lowest) level for the needs of self-defense, that means to have the minimum but assured capabilities for a retaliatory second strike. Some studies have suggested a shift of Chinese nuclear posture toward limited deterrence, where China could employ nuclear weapons to deter both conventional and nuclear wars, and even to exercise escalation control in the event of a conventional confrontation.[9] However, the basic logic of China’s nuclear thinking dictates nuclear weapons as deterring—not as a means of winning against nuclear weapons.<br />

<br />
China’s strong opposition to U.S. BMD development and deployment has been adequately conveyed and extensively studied in the United States, for this issue has been a decade-long topic for hot debates. Unlike other issues, Chinese concerns over BMD has had the most vocal and vehement expression by government officials, scholars, military officers, and even ordinary people who post their views in Internet chat rooms. On December 13, 2001, President Bush officially announced that the United States would withdraw from the ABM Treaty—a cornerstone arms control regime set up in the 1970s. Six months later, the United States was free of any legal bindings against its development and deployment of BMD systems. The later deployment decision by President Bush came as no surprise. China had succeeded in stopping the United States from setting up a missile defense system, which threatens to break the delicate deterrent balance between China and the United States. A national missile defense system, no matter how limited it would be, would no doubt cause a rededuction in China’s deterrent effects against U.S. nuclear use. American scholars always have difficulties understanding why the Chinese should worry about a shield to protect their own homeland. However, this very defensive shield—when used against the only flying dagger the opponent throws at it before taking the deadly blow—would be very offensive in nature. We all know the famous paradoxical logic in deterrence relations: nuclear force to be used as a last resort against enemy cities is defensive in nature and stabilizing in function, while a leak-proof umbrella against nuclear attack is offensive in nature and destabilizing. China is also reasonably sensitive to any BMD systems covering Taiwan. Only a limited missile shield would relieve Americans of possible Chinese nuclear retaliation, permitting them to intervene more readily and threaten nuclear use at it did in the 1958 Taiwan crisis. It could encourage Taiwan to take more provocative moves towards independence by reducing the deterrent effect of the PLA’s missile force. It would signify semi-alliance relationship between the United States and Taiwan. And it will reduce the effectiveness of China’s military operations against the island. China has a further reason to worry about BMD—that is BMD development cooperation, and future joint deployment, between the United States and Japan. This would indicate a closer alliance relationship and a more coordinated course of action during future Taiwan conflict between the two Cold War allies. An upper-tier BMD system jointly deployed by the two countries in the name of protecting allies and overseas troops would be readily turned into BMD systems to offset mainland missile attack against Taiwan. It would also be a complicating development when Sino-Japanese relations are getting sour, and the concern over Japan’s rearming is genuine. Therefore, BMD development and deployment is by far the most significant factor impacting China’s nuclear calculus. China has to think how to maintain a guaranteed retaliatory second strike capability in the face of a U.S. BMD system. It’s also necessary to review sufficiency and survivability of the arsenal. At the core of the Chinese concern is the credibility of the mutual deterrent relationship that China needs to deter American nuclear threats or nuclear use in cross-trait conflict. III. Prospects for China’s Nuclear Deterrence in the 21st Century The fact that China belonged to neither of the Cold War blocs has some implication in observing and anticipating the future of China’s nuclear deterrence. The general rather than immediate nature makes it easier for China’s nuclear policy to adjust to the 21st century world. Never before had China fixed upon any nuclear adversaries, nor will it pick a specific nuclear enemy today. Even the newly emerging nuclear threat from India can be readily dealt with by existing policy. The issue of Taiwan has forced the Chinese to face up to the possibility of military conflict with the United States over Taiwan. However, such conflict should have been assumed nuclear-irrelevant but for the issuance of the NPR by the U.S. Department of Defense. Through the NPR, the Chinese know for sure that in the United States' perception, China is a nuclear target, and Taiwan is a scenario in which nuclear weapons are to be used. Even if nothing could be worse for China than a nuclear confrontation with the United States, China has to brave itself to this, for the most vital of all vital national interests is involved here. However, it would be totally wrong to assume China is going to deter U.S. conventional military intervention by threatening nuclear use, for China can hardly make such threats credible. So far, the most significant factor that will influence China’s nuclear calculus will be U.S. deployments of national and advanced theater missile defenses. For China has to reevaluate the sufficiency of its nuclear arsenal to counter U.S. missile defense systems and retain a guaranteed ability to retaliate. However, such reevaluation results only in the variation of the size of nuclear arsenals, not in the change of the policy’s basic nature. The concern in China is over the credibility of its retaliatory deterrence against American nuclear use. Both Taiwan and BMD are important factors that will have impacts on Chinese nuclear calculus: The former highlights the necessity and urgency of ensuring a mutual deterrent relationship with the United States to prevent nuclear use in the Taiwan conflict, which might have not been so important or urgent before. Only in this way, has Taiwan become relevant to China’s nuclear policy. The latter emphasizes the concern over the credibility of Chinese deterrence against the United States. Concerns over Taiwan and BMD combine to form the focus of China’s nuclear modernization—the maintenance of sufficient nuclear capabilities that can survive a first strike to inflict unacceptable damage on the enemy in a retaliatory strike. Put in more accurate words, China’s nuclear modernization is to keep valid its long-standing nuclear policy. China’s nuclear policy in the 21st century will retain all the characteristics that I have specified above, and suggest no deviation from the current one. So far, the three factors do not provide enough reasons for China to move up to the limited deterrence posture. Another thing that may interest us is how China would translate its nuclear deterrence requirement into concrete numbers (two-digit or three digit warheads and delivery vehicles). While this subject is beyond my capacity to discuss, I think the most important thing is to understand the underlying logic, not to guess at the numbers. That is, China has to keep a credible retaliatory nuclear force which can survive a massive first strike and launch a counter-strike at the enemy. If the nuclear logic does not change fundamentally, the nature of the policy would not change. Slight increases or decreases in the numbers only reflect changes in calculating the sufficiency of the second strike capability. All three generations of Chinese leaders have expressed their intent to keep the arsenal small, only “at the minimum level for self-defense.” Any excess in numbers would be an unnecessary drain on the nation’s limited budgetary resources. On the other hand, even if the size of the arsenal doesn’t vary, a change in the underlying logic would trigger a major shift of the policy—such as a shift from a minimum to a limited deterrence posture, where nuclear weapons could be designed and planned for winning wars instead of deterring wars. The last point concerns the nuclear relationship between China and the United States. It is in China’s vital interests to have a certain degree of deterrent effect over other nuclear weapon states, be it Russia, the United States, and potentially India. At the same time, China is willing to accept vulnerability as its NFU policy indicates. China has been having such a deterrent relationship during the Cold War period with the Soviet Union from the 1970s, and later with the United States from mid 1980s, though the significance of such deterrent relationship lessened because China and the United States enjoyed an ever-improving and stable relation until 1989. Since the mid-1990s, both Taiwan and BMD have threatened to break such a relationship—the former by gaining U.S. defense commitment, the latter by offsetting China’s ability to retaliate. These two factors are actually American factors. If China, the United States, and all the other nuclear weapon states want to share regional and global security, peace and stability, they have to share a certain degree of insecurity first. And that means accepting some vulnerability by pledging to a NFU policy, so as to form a multilateral deterrent relationship among the “Haves,” and offering more security assurance to the “Have-nots.”<br />

China and the United States are not in a strategic weapons arms race. Nonetheless, their modernization and sizing decisions increasingly are framed with the other in mind. Nuclear weapons are at the core of this interlocking pattern of development. In particular, China is the only permanent member of the UN Security Council expanding its arsenal; it is also enhancing its arsenal. The basic facts of Chinese strategic modernization are well known, if the details remain frustratingly opaque. China is deploying road-mobile, solid-fueled missiles, giving it a heighted degree of security in its second-strike capability. It is beginning to deploy ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). It is researching a wide range of warhead and delivery systems technologies that will lead to increased accuracy and, more pointedly, increased penetration against ballistic missile defenses. The size of China's deliverable arsenal against the United States will undoubtedly increase beyond the few dozen that it possessed recently.[1] The pace of growth thus far has been moderate, although China has only recently developed reliable, survivable delivery systems. The final endpoint remains mired in opacity and uncertainty, although several score of deliverable warheads seems likely for the near term. These developments on the strategic side are coupled with elements of conventional modernization that impinge on the strategic balance.[2] The relevant issue, however, is not simply an evaluation of the Chinese modernization program, but rather an evaluation of the interaction of that modernization with U.S. capabilities and interests. U.S. capabilities are also changing. Under the provisions of START and SORT, the United States has continued to engage in quantitative reductions of its operational nuclear arsenal. At the same, there is ongoing updating of warhead guidance and fusing systems. Ballistic missile defense systems of a variety of footprints are being deployed. The U.S. SSBN force now leans more toward the Pacific than the Atlantic, reversing the Cold War deployment. Guam's capacity to support heavy bombers and attack submarines has been enhanced. Furthermore, advances in U.S. conventional weaponry have been so substantial that they too promise strategic effects: prompt global strike holds out the promise of a U.S. weapon on target anywhere in the world in less than an hour and B-2s with highly accurate weapons can sustain strategic effects over a campaign. What are the concerns posed by these two programs of dynamic strategic arsenals? Most centrally, the development of the strategic forces detailed above has increasingly assumed an interlocked form. The U.S. revolution in precision guided munitions was followed by an emphasis on mobility in the Chinese missile force. U.S. missile defense systems have clearly spurred an emphasis on countermeasures in China's ICBM force and quantitative buildups in its regional missile arsenals.[3] Beijing's new submarine-based forces further enhance the security of China's second-strike capability in the face of a potential U.S. strike but are likely to lead to increased attention to anti-submarine warfare in the United States. China's recent anti-satellite test provoked a U.S. demonstration of similar capabilities. Such reciprocal responses have the potential to move toward a tightly coupled arms race and certainly have already worsened threat perceptions on each side. The potential for conflict is not simply that of inadvertent escalation; there are conflicts of interests between the two. Heightening threat perceptions in that context greatly complicates diplomacy. Further, the dangers of inadvertent escalation have been exacerbated by some of these moves. Chinese SSBN deployment will stress an untested command-and-control system. Similar dangers in the Cold War were mitigated, although not entirely overcome, over a period of decades of development of personnel and technical solutions. China appears to have few such controls in place today. U.S. deployment of highly accurate nuclear warheads is consistent with a first-strike doctrine and seems sized for threats larger than &quot;rogue&quot; nations. These too would undermine stability in an intense crisis.<br />

The doomsday scenario THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -- horror of horrors -- raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.<br />

<strong>B. Space modernization – BMD response</strong><br />

<br />
China might try to develop an antisatellite system capable of directly attacking key components of a U.S. NMD system. Chinese military analysts have increasingly recognized that space control provides the key to military victories in modern warfare. Increasingly, attention is being paid to information dominance through space power, in particular with reference to Desert Storm and Operation Allied Force. In both contexts, U.S. space systems played a critical role in gathering and transferring intelligence.143 One of the major lessons PLA analysts have drawn from the 1990-1991 Gulf War is how U.S. dominance and utilization of space gave it a decisive edge over Iraq. More than 70 satellites crisscrossed the skies over the Gulf, forming four major aerial systems: surveillance and monitoring, communications logistics, navigation and global positioning, and meteorological logistics. The same concept was applied during the Kosovo air operations in 1999, in which NATO deployed 50 satellites of 15 to 20 different types to coordinate intelligence gathering and air attacks.144 Commenting on the U.S. Air Force space war game Schriever-2001, Colonel Teng Jianqun, editor- in-chief of the journal Waiguo junshi xueshu (World Mifi' tary Review, a publication by che prestigious PLA Academy of Military Science), pointed out that &quot;whoever first occupies the commanding height in military technology may be able to sei^ the initiative in war. That command -ing height today is space dominance. The implications for the PLA? Space fighting is not far off. National security has already exceeded territory and territorial water and air' space, and territorial space should also be added. The modes of defense will no longer be to fight on our own territory and tight for marine rights and interests, and we must engage in space defense as well as air defense.145 Even though no conclusive evidence exists as to specific programs regarding the development of these weapons, viable motives and defensive military strategic implications for China's ASAT use are not inconceivable.14&quot; First, given that U.S. missile defense systems must operate with satellite assistance, a Chinese ASAT capability could be useful in disabling U.S. satellites, hence paralyzing NMD. Indeed, Chinese experts have suggested three specific measures in response to U.S. NMD deployment. These range from direct space-launched attacks from satellites armed with nuclear warheads. SLBMs, and ASAT.MT Second, the United States is increasingly unit ring its satellites when firing precision-guided munitions. Formerly using lasers to pinpoint a target, these conventional weapons are now beginning to depend on global positioning satellites to find their destinations. These weapons were used in the Kosovo bombing campaign when U.S. forces destroyed the Chinese Embassy. Third, in the future China may face hostile U.S. action against its own limited space assets.<br />

<strong>Causes space accidents and nuclear war</strong><br />

In fact we have just learnt that the Air Force is working on plans to develop a “counter-ASAT” space weapon system by 2011. Reports suggest that most aspects of these plans are secret but some information has emerged in the public domain that sheds some interesting light on US space weapons planning. The system is known as the Rapid Attack Identification Detection Reporting System (Raidrs) Block 20. The rationale for this program is to develop information in a timely fashion to enable the Pentagon to intercept a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon, which are launched from the Earth, before it strikes its target in low earth orbit. But if the asset used to achieve this objective is space based then this may well enable BMD hawks to also obtain a space based BMD interception capability and there is no reason to suppose that a “counter-ASAT” weapon could not also function as an offensive space weapon. Nascent Asian Space Race As noted, China has tested an anti satellite weapon and Russia has stated that it would not allow other states to control space and threaten its own space assets. In Asia a nascent space race seems to be developing between China, Japan and India. In the far future the large deposits of Helium-3 on the moon's surface could lead to a militarized race to colonize the moon to secure Helium-3 for nuclear fusion energy technologies based on anuetronic fusion reactions in the context of depleting hydro-carbons. Washington argues that it has too much commercially riding on space to allow others to have the potential capability of disrupting U.S. space assets. In 1998 the failure of one satellite, the Galaxy IV, made some 80% of pagers in the U.S. malfunction. Though the latest Russian and Chinese space arms control proposal is flawed, because of the clumsy definition of what constitutes a “space weapon,” this doesn’t mean that space arms control is not possible in principle. A global space arms control regime would protect U.S., Russian, Chinese, and even Australian space assets. An arms race in space will eventually lead other states to catch up with the United States and thereby placing Washington's commercial satellites at risk. Space weaponization may well have cataclysmic consequences given the link between space weapons and nuclear weapons strategy. This is because Russia, and the United States, to a certain extent rely on satellites for early warning of nuclear attack. As other space nations with nuclear weapons develop their space capacity it is expected that they will follow suit. The deployment of space weapons means that the first shot in a nuclear war would be fired against these early warning satellites. Currently strategic planners in Moscow have about 10 minutes between warning of an attack and the decision to launch nuclear weapons in response before they impact. Weapons in space would lower this in certain scenarios down to seconds. This would also apply for weapons placed in space that would be considered to be defensive such as say a space based BMD interceptor or a “counter-ASAT” weapon. On occasion, ground warning radars falsely show that a nuclear attack has been launched. In the 1990s a false alarm went all the way up to President Boris Yeltsin and was terminated after approximately eight minutes. We are still here, noted analysts believe, because warning satellites would have given Moscow real time information showing the alarm to be false. Should such a false alarm coincide with an accident involving an early warning satellite when space weapons are known to exist, an accidental nuclear exchange could result. The risk would increase if the false alarm occurred during a crisis. Space weapons could lead to itchy fingers on nuclear triggers. They would therefore significantly increase the importance nuclear weapon states place upon nuclear deterrence.<br />

Any clear-cut distinction between offensive and defense in the TMD context is hopelessly muddied when one realizes that plans for the NTW system include a substantial space component. An elaborate network of space satellites (as well as spaceborne forces to protect them) would be essential features of any robust NTW system, providing early warning data of enemy missile launches, as well as tracking information designed to guide SM-3 interceptors to their targets in mid-flight. It is instructive to note that politically powerful missile defense proponents such as U.S. Senator Bob “Spaceman” Smith (R-NH) envision NTW integrated into an overall space force that would pursue both defensive and offensive military missions.49 We need to incorporate forward-deployed capabilities like the Navy Theater Wide program and the Air Force Airborne Laser as space-based missile defense programs to ensure [that] we can stop missiles in their boost phase, dropping the debris fallout over our adversary’s homes, not ours…[S]pace offers us…the prospect of inflicting violence—all with great precision and nearly instantaneously, and often more cheaply. With credible offensive and defensive space control, we will deter our adversaries, reassure our allies, and guard our nation’s growing reliance on global commerce.50 This full-throated call for a robust blend of offensive and defensive space weaponry reflects a strategic principle elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, “anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand.”51 The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent “dual capability” of spaceborne weapon components. To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting “death stars,” capable of sending munitions hurtling through the earth’s atmosphere at dizzying velocities.52 As Marc Vidricaire, a member of the Canadian Delegation to the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, explains: “If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land.”53 Furthermore, spaceborne BMD components can be used for offensive attacks in outer space itself, where orbiting space assets belonging to adversaries could be targeted for destruction. According to defense analyst James E. Oberg, “…the benign, defensive nature of a ballistic missile killer is not the only facet of such a system—it also has inherent offensive capability against satellites.”54 This dual capability of BMD systems provides one rationale for why space weapons advocates such as Senator Smith propose to make offensive attack weapons part of missile defense. In a world where deployment of purely offensive space weaponry might be difficult to justify as a stand-alone military initiative, Oberg speculates, “the means by which the placement of space-based weapons will likely occur is under a second U.S. space policy directive—that of ballistic missile defense.”55 Although these “death star” scenarios might seem like they come straight out of Hollywood special effects studios, it is worth noting that the U.S. Space Command is on record endorsing military strategy that favors weaponization of space as a force multiplier for offensive attack missions. An official planning document entitled “Vision for 2020” foresees “space-based strike weapons” as part of “global engagement capabilities” designed to enable “application of precision force from, through, and to space.”56 Aggressive pursuit of these “strike weapons” is imperative, according to Space Command officials, because “space superiority is emerging as an essential element of battlefield success and future warfare.”57 Arguing that “it is inevitable that mankind will weaponize space,” Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas D. Bell claims in a 1999 paper that, “The U.S. ability to conduct combat operations in this environment will provide the technical asymmetry that the U.S. will need to win the next war, just as it used strategic bombers and the atomic bomb to win World War II and stealth technology and precision guided munitions to win the Gulf War.”58 These plans recently received concrete expression in comments from Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, Air Force Space Command Commander. While addressing a group at the Joint Tactical Ground Station in South Korea, Eberhart declared that “[s]pace is the ultimate high ground…Not only do we have to use it, we have to be able to defend it and deny our enemy the use of space if we are at war…we have to ensure space superiority for our commanders and men and women who rely on it during the fight.”59 Although missile defense advocates frequently trumpet the “purely defensive” nature of BMD, such systems exist in a strategic framework that ineluctably includes offensive space weaponry. “The PR spin is that the U.S. military push into space is about missile defense or defense of U.S. space satellites. But the volumes of material coming out of the military are concerned mainly with offense— with using space to establish military domination over the world below,” notes professor Karl Grossman.60 Such a suggestion carries particular significance for Japan, since as Frank Umbach, Senior Research Fellow at the German Society of Foreign Affairs, explains, “a possible Japanese TMD deployment may require an integration of the anti-missile defense command and control (C-2) systems of Japan and the U.S., which could have far-reaching implications for both sides.”61 Eventual deployment of a joint Japan-U.S. TMD system could saddle Japanese officials with the sober responsibility of making command decisions regarding use of spaceborne weapons for offensive military missions. It is tempting to take comfort in the idea that JDA leaders would not permit a joint missile defense system such as NTW to evolve into a platform for offensive space power, especially since such a development would flout Japanese legal and constitutional prohibitions against such military adventures. However, in a joint command situation, it is not clear that such constraints would hold up, especially in light of intimidating comments by space power enthusiasts such as Senator Smith, who vows to use his position on Capitol Hill to ram space weaponry down the throats of opponents, regardless of how vocal they are: “If the Air Force cannot or will not embrace spacepower, we in Congress will have to drag them there, kicking and screaming if necessary.”62 Another possibility is that Japanese objections against incorporation of offensive space power into a joint missile defense program could be rendered moot by strategic deception. Part II of this essay explored cases where U.S. missile defense advocates deployed subterfuge to camouflage the actual purpose of BMD programs, in order to insulate the program from political criticism. A similar approach would seem politically attractive for public affairs officers dealing with the sensitive issue of a Japanese TMD’s offensive military capabilities. Since such capabilities would clearly prove to be public relations liabilities for missile defense advocates attempting to justify TMD to Asian publics, there could be great institutional inertia to pursue a Pentagon-style public relations strategy of hiding such capabilities behind layers of secrecy, classification, and obfuscation, then dominating public debate with talk of “purely defensive” BMD systems. However, back door deployment of offensive space weapons would pose grave security risks, given the potentially disastrous consequences of an unconstrained arms race in space. Lt. Col. Bell provides a glimpse of some of the varieties of space weapons that might be produced in such a scenario: “A mix of space weapons will offer the capability to destroy various types of surface and sub-surface targets with three types of weapons: continuous lasers that use heat to melt structures and destroy them; pulsed lasers that vaporize material and penetrate the structure; and kinetic energy weapons that provide the capability to attack targets hundreds of feet under the surface of the earth.”63 According to Senator Charles S. Robb (D-VA), space weaponization could transform Reagan’s hopeful Star Wars vision into an ominous “death star” future. During the Reagan years, advocates of the Strategic Defense Initiative ran an effective television spot featuring children being saved from nuclear attack by a shield represented by a rainbow. If we weaponize space, we will face a very different image—the image of hundreds of weapons-laden satellites orbiting directly over our homes and our families 24 hours a day, ready to fire within seconds. If fired, they would destroy thousands of ground, air, and space targets within minutes, before there is even a chance of knowing what has happened, or why. This would be a dark future, a future we should avoid at all costs.64 A buildup of space weapons with capability to execute offensive missions might begin with noble intentions of “peace through strength” deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that “…the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use.”65 Military commanders desiring to harness the precision strike capability afforded by spacebased “smart” weapons might order deliberate attacks on enemy ground targets in a crisis. The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense “use or lose” pressure into strategic calculations, with the specter of split-second laser attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting death stars with automated “hair trigger” devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed “complexly interactive, tightly coupled” industrial systems, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other’s flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. He further explains, “[t]he odd term ‘normal accident’ is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable.”66 Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to “normal accidents.” It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to Bowman, “even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage—even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!”67 In the same laser technology touted by President Reagan as the quintessential tool of peace, David Langford sees one of the most wicked offensive weapons ever conceived: “One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people.”68 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to a space weapon attack would escalate by retaliating with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.<br />

Another misperception is that in the long run China will endeavor to drive the U.S. out of East Asia. Again this is not a correct assumption. From Beijing's perspective, the United States is an Asia-Pacific power, although not an Asian power, and its political, economic and security interests in the region are deep-rooted, as are its commitments to regional stability and prosperity. In fact, Beijing has always welcomed a constructive U.S. role in regional affairs. At the same time however, Beijing also feels uneasy with certain aspects of U.S. policy. As a superpower, the United States has been too dominant and intrusive in managing regional affairs. It fails to pay due respect to the voices of other regional players, and sometimes gets too involved in the internal affairs of other states, lacking an understanding of their culture, history and values. While there is no danger of the U.S. being driven out of East Asia, its current policy may result in the U.S. wearing out its welcome in the region, thus undermining its contributions to stability and prosperity. In addition to the above misperceptions about China's regional intentions, the United States and China also hold diverging conceptions of national and regional security. Hegemonic stability vs. security cooperation In the post-Cold War era, Washington has been advocating an Asia-Pacific security structure with the U.S. as the sole leader and with U.S.-led bilateral alliances as the backbone. This is in essence hegemonic stability. Beijing believes, however, that regional security rests on the cooperation of regional members and a blend of various useful approaches (unilateral, bilateral and multilateral, institutional and non-institutional, track I and track II, etc.), not just on one single country and a set of bilateral security alliances. Unilateral security vs. mutual security The United States currently possesses the most powerful military in the world. However, it continues to pump resources into its defense industry to develop even more sophisticated offensive weaponry, thus retaining its paramount superiority in both conventional and strategic arsenals. At the same time, Washington has been pursuing both national missile defense (NMD) and theater missile defense (TMD) systems, aimed at protecting itself from other countries. However, this kind of unilateral security comes at the expense of others' security. The Chinese believe that security is always mutual, and when one side tries to enhance its security, it has to take into account the impact on the security of others. While any country has the legitimate right to develop its defensive and offensive capability as it likes, a responsible power should avoid seeking unilateral security and instead should promote mutual or common security. Absolute security vs. relative security In terms of capability, the United States is now the most secure country in the world. Any other country that initiates an attack on the U.S. would invite destructive retaliation. Gauged by a notional security coefficient, the U.S. is now ninety-nine percent secure in dealing with external military threats. Yet, Washington seems intent on seeking absolute, or one-hundred percent, security by continuing to invest in both defensive and offensive weapons. Nevertheless, if the United States were absolutely secure, other countries would then be absolutely insecure, totally subject to threats or coercion of the U.S. To avoid such a situation, they will certainly react by developing their own capabilities, which would result in an arms buildup cycle, wasted resources and eventually, increased tensions. The Chinese, on the other hand, believe in relative security rather than absolute security. They would be content with simply preserving a reliable deterrence capability, both conventional and strategic. As Chinese security experts contend, there is simply no such thing as absolute security, and any effort geared in that direction is both irresponsible and futile.<br />

BMD deployment may damage the effectiveness of deterrence and US security commitments. The willingness of the United States to spend tens of billions of dollars to defend itself against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats carried on ballistic missiles reinforces the perception that WMD capabilities are an effective means of deterring US intervention and therefore increases the incentive for insecure states to seek WMD. The joint development of BMD between the United States and Japan could destabilize the security situation in North-East Asia. As concerns mount over the DPRK’s nuclear and missile programmes, Japan is developing new missile defence systems. This has caused further suspicion and concern about the intention and the future military role of Japan, not only from China, but also from other Asian countries. The US BMD programme is also a potential factor that may undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait. China fears that if the United States transfers BMD systems to Taiwan, it will encourage the separatists in Taiwan to move toward independence and make it more difficult for the mainland to strive for peaceful unification. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman warned that the discussion of US-Taiwan anti-missile cooperation and weapons sales would send the wrong signals to Taiwan's independence forces, and urged the US to clearly recognize the damage it could cause on such a sensitive issue. Missile defence undermines the cooperation of major powers in countering proliferation of ballistic missiles in East Asia. American plans to deploy BMD are viewed with suspicion by both Russia and China, as BMD has the potential to nullify the credibility of both China’s and Russia’s nuclear arsenals. The strategic goal of the United States in developing and deploying BMD is to achieve an absolute US military superiority in both offensive and defensive capabilities, further widening the existing disparity between the United States and other countries. This will certainly undermine the trust and affect cooperation among the major powers in dealing with the proliferation of ballistic missiles in East Asia. The Bush Administration’s approach to dealing with WMD threats has combined a strong emphasis on deploying BMD with conscious efforts to downgrade the role of multilateral arms control and nonproliferation treaties. Its withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, negative attitude towards the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, and rejection of the verification protocol to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention have damaged other parts of the non-proliferation regime such as the NPT and efforts to combat missile proliferation. The selective policy and attitude of the US towards nonproliferation regimes only undermines the credibility of all the existing non-proliferation regimes and makes it difficult to establish a sound, universal non-proliferation regime<br />

<strong>Cooperation on missile defense outweighs other security dilemmas – creates arms race</strong><br />

The missile defense (MD), especially the theater missile defense (TMD) that the U.S. and Japan are jointly developing now has become the most significant negative issue in security area in Asia-Pacific region. It has caused a serious trouble in major powers’ relations between the U.S., Japan, Russia and China in East Asia. All those major powers take missile defense as a serious strategic issue and worry that such a system will destroy current strategic balance between major powers in the region. Russian and Chinese also argue that TMD would change military balance in the region which will give U.S.-Japan a new superiority over others. MD may also cause a new round of arms race in both offensive and defensive areas in Asia in the new century. It has become a controversial issue in bilateral security talks among those major powers and a hot issue in multilateral arena such as the United Nations and ARF(ASEAN Regional Forum), thus becomes an obstacle for further arms control, disarmament agreements and bilateral and multilateral security cooperation. To be sure, the MD system that the United States and Japan are going to build in East Asia, have and will continue to have different impacts to different nations in the region. The system may not have great impact to the security policies and structures in Southeast Asia, however, it will have a significant impact to Northeast Asia, to major powers and their relations in the region. The military and strategic balance may be reshaped in East Asia because the development of missile defense in the region. I. MD, Major Power Relations and Strategic Balance in East Asia TMD is a major issue to all the major powers in East Asia. All the major powers, the United States, Japan, Russia, China, have taken serous positions toward the theater missile defense, even the system is still under the process of development.<br />

If the possibility existed of a mistaken preemption during and immediately after the Cold War, between the experienced nuclear forces and command systems of America and Russia, then it may be a matter of even more concern with regard to states with newer and more opaque forces and command systems. In addition, the Americans and Soviets (and then Russians) had a great deal of experience getting to know one another’s military operational proclivities and doctrinal idiosyncrasies, including those that might influence the decision for or against war. Another consideration, relative to nuclear stability in the present century, is that the Americans and their NATO allies shared with the Soviets and Russians a commonality of culture and historical experience. Future threats to American or Russian security from weapons of mass destruction may be presented by states or nonstate actors motivated by cultural and social predispositions not easily understood by those in theWest nor subject to favorable manipulation during a crisis. The spread of nuclear weapons in Asia presents a complicated mosaic of possibilities in this regard. States with nuclear forces of variable force structure, operational experience, and command-control systems will be thrown into a matrix of complex political, social, and cultural crosscurrents contributory to the possibility of war. In addition to the existing nuclear powers in Asia, others may seek nuclear weapons if they feel threatened by regional rivals or hostile alliances. Containment of nuclear proliferation in Asia is a desirable political objective for all of the obvious reasons. Nevertheless, the present century is unlikely to see the nuclear hesitancy or risk aversion that marked the ColdWar, in part, because the military and political discipline imposed by the Cold War superpowers no longer exists, but also because states in Asia have new aspirations for regional or global respect.12 The spread of ballistic missiles and other nuclear-capable delivery systems in Asia, or in the Middle East with reach into Asia, is especially dangerous because plausible adversaries live close together and are already engaged in ongoing disputes about territory or other issues.13 The Cold War Americans and Soviets required missiles and airborne delivery systems of intercontinental range to strike at one another’s vitals. But short-range ballistic missiles or fighter-bombers suffice for India and Pakistan to launch attacks at one another with potentially “strategic” effects. China shares borders with Russia, North Korea, India, and Pakistan; Russia, with China and NorthKorea; India, with Pakistan and China; Pakistan, with India and China; and so on. The short flight times of ballistic missiles between the cities or military forces of contiguous states means that very little time will be available for warning and attack assessment by the defender. Conventionally armed missiles could easily be mistaken for a tactical nuclear first use. Fighter-bombers appearing over the horizon could just as easily be carrying nuclear weapons as conventional ordnance. In addition to the challenges posed by shorter flight times and uncertain weapons loads, potential victims of nuclear attack in Asia may Nuclear Crisis Stability in Future Asia 121 also have first strike–vulnerable forces and command-control systems that increase decision pressures for rapid, and possibly mistaken, retaliation. This potpourri of possibilities challenges conventional wisdom about nuclear deterrence and proliferation on the part of policymakers and academic theorists. For policymakers in the United States and NATO, spreading nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in Asia could profoundly shift the geopolitics of mass destruction from a European center of gravity (in the twentieth century) to an Asian and/or Middle Eastern center of gravity (in the present century).14 This would profoundly shake up prognostications to the effect that wars of mass destruction are now passe, on account of the emergence of the “Revolution in Military Affairs” and its encouragement of information-based warfare.15 Together with this, there has emerged the argument that large-scale war between states or coalitions of states, as opposed to varieties of unconventional warfare and failed states, are exceptional and potentially obsolete.16 The spread ofWMDand ballistic missiles in Asia could overturn these expectations for the obsolescence or marginalization of major interstate warfare.<br />

<strong>TMD causes quick Chinese modernization that leads to global nuclear proliferation</strong><br />

Owing to its small size and its current deployment mode—in which nuclear warheads and the liquid-fueled ICBMs are separately stored and launch preparation takes several hours—a limited U.S. missile defense system could neutralize China’s strategic nuclear deterrent. While the initial U.S. missile defense deployment seems moderate, the Bush administration has indicated that it would be “a starting point for improved and expanded capabilities later.” Indeed, unlike the limited missile defenses planned by the Clinton administration, the layered missile-defense architecture the Bush administration envisions includes multiple basing missile defense systems capable of intercepting incoming ballistic missiles during their boost phase, mid-course, or terminal phase.4 Thus, while China’s public rhetoric against U.S. missile defenses has receded, President George W. Bush’s December 17, 2002, announcement of initial U.S. missile defense deployment by 2004 received a moderate response from China. Instead of vehemently criticizing the U.S. decision for its potential to trigger an arms race, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson merely commented that the “development of the missile defense system should not undermine global strategic stability, nor should it undermine international and regional security.”2 Beijing’s rather muted reaction, however, understates its deep concern over the serious security challenges it is likely to face in the coming years. For more than two decades, China has maintained (and appeared content with) a small strategic nuclear deterrent composed of some 20 or so intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the continental United States. Partly because of technological hurdles that the Chinese defense industry has proved incapable of overcoming, but perhaps more out of a deliberate political decision in favor of economic development, Beijing until recently had not placed The Nonproliferation Review/Spring 2003 CHINESE RESPONSES TO U.S. MISSILE DEFENSES 76 its sense of vulnerability has not. U.S. missile defense systems, once operational, threaten the very credibility, reliability, and effectiveness of China’s woefully inadequate strategic nuclear arsenal. Barring a significant breakthrough in achieving strategic understandings between Beijing and Washington, a U.S. decision to deploy ballistic missile defense systems will force China to react in ways that could have farreaching consequences for global arms control and nonproliferation and, consequently, regional stability.5 China may embark on a nuclear modernization drive in both quantitative and qualitative terms unseen in the past two decades. Unlike Russia, which hard economic realities may prevent from maintaining a large nuclear arsenal (a number higher than the 1,700-2,200 range stipulated in the May 2002 Moscow Treaty), China has the economic wherewithal to significantly expand and modernize its strategic nuclear force. While in relative terms Chinese defense spending remains low as a percentage of its gross domestic product, it has risen at a doubledigit rate since 1990 as the economy registers significant growth during the same period. In addition, China has a large foreign exchange reserve (about $286 billion at the end of 2002), which would make available additional funds for foreign acquisitions and purchases.<br />
Analysts suggest that based on such rates of increase, China’s defense budget could double by 2005.6<br />

Further, the large number of states that became capable of building nuclear weapons over the years, but chose not to, can be reasonably well explained by the fact that most were formally allied with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Both these superpowers had strong nuclear forces and put great pressure on their allies not to build nuclear weapons. Since the Cold War, the US has retained all its allies. In addition, NATO has extended its protection to some of the previous allies of the Soviet Union and plans on taking in more. Nuclear proliferation by India and Pakistan, and proliferation programmes by North Korea, Iran and Iraq, all involve states in the opposite situation: all judged that they faced serious military opposition and had little prospect of establishing a reliable supporting alliance with a suitably strong, nuclear-armed state. What would await the world if strong protectors, especially the United States, were [was] no longer seen as willing to protect states from nuclear-backed aggression? At least a few additional states would begin to build their own nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them to distant targets, and these initiatives would spur increasing numbers of the world’s capable states to follow suit. Restraint would seem ever less necessary and ever more dangerous. Meanwhile, more states are becoming capable of building nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. Many, perhaps most, of the world’s states are becoming sufficiently wealthy, and the technology for building nuclear forces continues to improve and spread. Finally, it seems highly likely that at some point, halting proliferation will come to be seen as a lost cause and the restraints on it will disappear. Once that happens, the transition to a highly proliferated world would probably be very rapid. While some regions might be able to hold the line for a time, the threats posed by wildfire proliferation in most other areas could create pressures that would finally overcome all restraint. Many readers are probably willing to accept that nuclear proliferation is such a grave threat to world peace that every effort should be made to avoid it. However, every effort has not been made in the past, and we are talking about much more substantial efforts now. For new and substantially more burdensome efforts to be made to slow or stop nuclear proliferation, it needs to be established that the highly proliferated nuclear world that would sooner or later evolve without such efforts is not going to be acceptable. And, for many reasons, it is not. First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous. Proliferating states will feel great pressures to obtain nuclear weapons and delivery systems before any potential opponent does. Those who succeed in outracing an opponent may consider preemptive nuclear war before the opponent becomes capable of nuclear retaliation. Those who lag behind might try to preempt their opponent’s nuclear programme or defeat the opponent using conventional forces. And those who feel threatened but are incapable of building nuclear weapons may still be able to join in this arms race by building other types of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological weapons. [The article continues…] The war between Iran and Iraq during the 1980s led to the use of chemical weapons on both sides and exchanges of missiles against each other’s cities. And more recently, violence in the Middle East escalated in a few months from rocks and small arms to heavy weapons on one side, and from police actions to air strikes and armoured attacks on the other. Escalation of violence is also basic human nature. Once the violence starts, retaliatory exchanges of violent acts can escalate to levels unimagined by the participants before hand. Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse. And such anger can lead us to impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible. In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possible with the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild West of the late 1800s. With most, if not all, nations wearing nuclear 'six-shooters' on their hips, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations, .<br />

It is not easy to predict Japan’s future path. The outlines of Japan’s security policy—the realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan, BMD, space development, and the demands of the business sector—were all established during the Bush-Koizumi era. The Obama and Hatoyama administrations might uphold this new status quo, or they might set off in very different directions. The Hatoyama government is, for now, buying time before making any major decisions on basic security policy. Under the previous government of Aso Taro, a report by an advisory panel to the prime minister on Japan’s future security was presented in June 2008. The key thrust of this panel was to change constitutional interpretation in order to allow the exercise of the right to collective self-defense. This report was essentially the supreme expression of the “defense reform” built by the Bush and Koizumi regimes. According to this plan, revision of the National Defense Program Guidelines and the Mid-Term Defense Program were also planned for the end of 2009. However, Prime Minister Hatoyama decided to postpone revision of defense policy by one year. He has also announced the establishment of a new panel of experts. Currently, the United States spends 42 percent of the $1.46 trillion dollars of annual global military expenditures, and East Asia is responsible for 13 percent. Furthermore, military expenditure in East Asia is increasing at a speed, which is pronounced even on an international scale. East Asia, home to an enormous U.S. military presence, is becoming the world’s largest weapons market. Japan has considerable latent potential to contribute to the freezing and reduction of regional, and global, military expenditures. Although Japan’s military expenditures remain quite high by global standards, Japan could set an important example for other countries by not increasing this amount and remaining within a standard of less than 1 percent of the GDP. The key issue is whether Japan will continue to develop high-tech military technology relating to BMD or not. The Japanese government and the Japanese public must answer a set of questions connected to these systems. Do they really function? What exactly is this system trying to protect, and from what? Is Japanese industry and technology just being mobilized in order to assume the place of U.S. defense? Is there a calm, efficient, and alternative method to removing the missile threat other than developing intercepting missiles? Toward Innovative Disarmament Cooperation Japanese and U.S. development of missile defense and related technology is clearly stimulating a backlash from China. This, in turn, helps China justify the modernization of its nuclear missile forces, leading to the promotion of a regional arms race and a worsening of the regional security environment. It is possible, through coordinated regional diplomacy and strengthened transparency and verification measures, to remove the nuclear and missile threats in a cooperative manner. Such an approach would increase confidence within the region, improve the security environment, ensure that regional resources are not being wastefully invested in military purposes, and bring us closer to building a sustainable peace in East Asia. To the extent that the realignment of U.S. forces reinforces U.S. regional and global power projection capabilities—rather than functioning as a cost-saving mechanism or as a means to enhance collective security—the backlash in Northeast Asia will be strengthened. If North Korea were to view the realignment of U.S. bases in Japan and South Korea as a threat, it will be less likely to follow through on denuclearization. If the relocation of U.S. bases leads to the construction of new bases within Japan or elsewhere, and increases expenses to that end, a key opportunity will have been lost. In order to serve the purpose of regional peace, the realignment of U.S. bases must be used to close redundant bases and promote their withdrawal. The new Hatoyama government is re-examining and trying to readjust the alliance with the United States in the name of “equal partnership” while also calling for the creation of an East Asia Community. Japan must not be misunderstood as reviving its early 20th-century ambitions for military hegemony in the region. The military spending issue can be a breakthrough for Japan, a way to show its commitment to peace while contributing to the construction of a new regional order. Japan should initiate negotiations with China and Korea toward a mutually coordinated freeze and reduction in military expenditure. Rather than abandoning its ties with the U.S. military industry, Japan should use the arms-export ban principle to negotiate and establish a regional framework to curb the arms trade and weapons proliferation. In 1967, Prime Minister Sato Eisaku introduced Japan’s Three Non-Nuclear Principles: not possessing, producing, or permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons. The Diet established these principles as national policy through a resolution in 1971. However, despite the “non-introduction” provision, considerable evidence indicates the existence of secret deals between the U.S. and Japanese government to allow the transit and port-calls of nuclear-weapons-equipped vessels, even since 1960. The Hatoyama government has established a commission to look into these secret deals. It is important to legalize these three principles to prevent a reintroduction of nuclear weapons into Japan. Legalizing the Non-Nuclear Principles will also create momentum for a nuclear weapon free zone in Northeast Asia that would, in turn, strengthen the nonproliferation regime in the region. Despite the advocacy of Keidanren, a concentrated investment in high-tech, military-civilian integrated technology would not lead to overall benefits for the Japanese economy. Such investments would have little economic effect for the vast majority of the Japanese labor force working in small or mid-size business. If Japan were to throw away its reputation as a “peaceful nation,” which it has maintained throughout the post-war era, the Japanese economy, so dependent on trade with Asia and the Middle East, would necessarily suffer. Instead of viewing the Self-Defense Forces as a way to boost employment, the Japanese government should establish an independent organization with straightforward humanitarian purposes such as disaster relief. Through exchange and humanitarian activities with and in neighboring countries, such an organization could reduce military expenditures and build regional confidence. The development of innovative cooperation for disarmament is now needed. At this critical juncture in history, only a cooperative-security approach can lead the way to the creation of a new order of peace.<br />

The successful December 2007 SM-3 test provided some encouragement to the Japanese Ministry of Defense at a time when it is suffering from major bribery scandals involving defense contractors and from the leak of classified data related to the BMD system. On November 28, former Administrative Vice Defense Minister Takamasa Moriya, the most influential figure in the Defense Ministry’s procurement branch, was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from defense contractor, Yamada Corporation. This incident exposed the lack of transparency in the equipment-procurement process at the Ministry of Defense. [30] In a more damaging development for BMD cooperation, on December 28, MSDF Lieutenant Commander Sumitaka Matsuuchi was indicted for distributing classified information on the Aegis system. Matsuuchi allegedly received a CD containing confidential Aegis data from his superior; he allegedly sent the information to the First Service School in Etajima, Hiroshima Prefecture, where it was circulated to various MSDF members. [31] The leakage of Aegis system data came to light when police investigators found a hard disk containing the confidential data at the home of an MSDF member during a January 2007 search in connection with his Chinese wife, who was alleged to have overstayed her visa. The highly classified information related to the Aegis system could directly affect the U.S.-Japan joint development of missile defense systems. Based on the U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement signed in 1954, Japan’s Secret Protection Law prohibits release of such sensitive information. The arrested MSDF lieutenant commander was alleged to have violated this stricture. This is the first time the law has been invoked since its adoption in 1954. [32] Due to the potentially serious damage caused by this leak, the United States has conditioned further BMD cooperation on the Japanese Ministry of Defense establishing a more effective system to protect highly sensitive information. Japan has procured much of its BMD equipment from the United States, including the Aegis and PAC-3 systems, and is dependent on U.S. early warning satellites to obtain vital information on when and where a ballistic missile is launched. [33] This makes it essential for the Japanese government to retain Washington’s trust<br />

However, in August 27,</span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> a new law, the &quot;Basic Space Law,&quot; entered into force, lifting the ban on Tokyo's use of space for defensive purpose</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">s. Thirty years earlier, </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">when Japan's Space Agency was established, the Diet unanimously adopted a resolution committing the country only to using space for peaceful purposes, which <span style="background-color: yellow;">has been interpreted</span> as non-military</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. The Basic Space Law changed that interpretation to nonaggressive, meaning the MSDF now can manufacture, possess, and operate its own satellites to support military operations such as ballistic missile defense. Thus, the MSDF plans to procure reconnaissance satellites, early warning satellites, and tracking and communications satellites--all areas in which Japan had been relying on the United States. (See &quot;Japan Enters New Space Age.&quot;) For instance, it was the U.S. Defense Support Program satellites that detected the North Korean missile launches in July 2006.

Your inevitability claims don’t apply- China threats have been falsely constructed- we must understand the true nature behind their military capabilities<br />
Pan 4 [Chengxin, is Lecturer in International Relations at Deakin University, Australia; The &quot;China Threat&quot; in American Self-Imagination: The Discursive Construction of Other as Power Politics Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, Vol. 29, 2004. /HN]<br />
Certainly, <u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">I do not deny China's potential for strategic misbehavior in the global context, nor do I claim the &quot;essential peacefulness&quot; of Chinese culture.</span></u> (40) Having said that, my main point here is that there is no such thing as &quot;Chinese reality&quot; that can automatically speak for itself, for example, as a &quot;threat.&quot; Rather, <u>the &quot;China threat&quot; is essentially a specifically social meaning given to China by its U.S. observers, a meaning that cannot be disconnected from the dominant U.S. self-construction</u>. Thus, <u>to fully understand the U.S. &quot;China threat&quot; argument, it is essential to recognize its autobiographical nature.</u> Indeed, the construction of other is not only a product of U.S. self-imagination, but often a necessary foil to it. For example, <u>by taking this particular representation of China as Chinese reality per se, those scholars are able to assert their self-identity as &quot;mature</u>,&quot; &quot;rational&quot; realists capable of knowing the &quot;hard facts&quot; of international politics, in distinction from those &quot;idealists&quot; whose views are said to be grounded more in &quot;an article of faith&quot; than in &quot;historical experience.&quot; (41) On the other hand, given that history is apparently not &quot;progressively&quot; linear, the invocation of a certain other not only helps explain away such historical uncertainties or &quot;anomalies&quot; and maintain the credibility of the allegedly universal path trodden by the United States, but also serves to highlight U.S. &quot;indispensability.&quot; As Samuel Huntington puts it, &quot;If being an American means being committed to the principles of liberty, democracy, individualism, and private property, and if there is no evil empire out there threatening those principles, what indeed does it mean to be an American, and what becomes of American national interests?&quot; (42) In this way, it seems that the constructions of the particular U.S. self and its other are always intertwined and mutually reinforcing. Some may suggest that there is nothing particularly wrong with this since psychologists generally agree that &quot;individuals and groups define their identity by differentiating themselves from and placing themselves in opposition to others.&quot; (43) This is perhaps true. As the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure tells us, meaning itself depends on difference and differentiation. (44) Yet, to understand the U.S. dichotomized constructions of self/other in this light is to normalize them and render them unproblematic, because it is also apparent that not all identity-defining practices necessarily perceive others in terms of either universal sameness or absolute otherness and that difference need not equate to threat. The Discursive Construction of China as Other in the &quot;China Threat&quot; Literature Having examined how the &quot;China threat&quot; literature is enabled by and serves the purpose of a particular U.S. self-construction, I want to turn now to the issue of how this literature represents a discursive construction of other, instead of an &quot;objective&quot; account of Chinese reality. This, I argue, has less to do with its portrayal of China as a threat per se than with its essentialization and totalization of China as an externally knowable object, independent of historically contingent contexts or dynamic international interactions. In this sense, <u>the discursive construction of China as a threatening other cannot be detached from (neo)realism,</u> a positivist, ahistorical framework of analysis within which global life is reduced to endless interstate rivalry for power and survival. As many critical IR scholars have noted, (neo)realism is not a transcendent description of global reality but is predicated on the modernist Western identity, which, in the quest for scientific certainty, has come to define itself essentially as the sovereign territorial nation-state. <u>This realist self-identity of Western states leads to the constitution of anarchy as the sphere of insecurity, disorder, and war</u>. In an anarchical system, as (neo)realists argue, &quot;the gain of one side is often considered to be the loss of the other,&quot; (45) and &quot;All other states are potential threats.&quot; (46) In order to survive in such a system, states inevitably pursue power or capability. In doing so, these realist claims represent what R. B. J. Walker calls &quot;a specific historical articulation of relations of universality/particularity and self/Other.&quot; (47) T<u>he (neo)realist paradigm has dominated the U.S. IR discipline in general and the U.S. China studies field in particular. As Kurt Campbell notes, after the end of the Cold War, a whole new crop of China experts &quot;are much more likely to have a background in strategic studies or international relations than China itself.&quot;</u> (48) As a result, <u>for those experts to know China is nothing more or less than to undertake a geopolitical analysis of it, often by asking only a few questions such as how China will &quot;behave&quot; in a strategic sense and how it may affect the regional or global balance of power, with a particular emphasis on China's military power or capabilities.</u> As Thomas J. Christensen notes, &quot;Although many have focused on intentions as well as capabilities, the most prevalent component of the [China threat] debate is the assessment of China's overall future military power compared with that of the United States and other East Asian regional powers.&quot; (49) Consequently, almost by default, China emerges as an absolute other and a threat thanks to this (neo)realist prism. The (neo)realist emphasis on survival and security in international relations dovetails perfectly with the U.S. self-imagination, because for the United States to define itself as the indispensable nation in a world of anarchy is often to demand absolute security. <u>As James Chace and Caleb Carr note, &quot;for over two centuries the aspiration toward an eventual condition of absolute security has been viewed as central to an effective American foreign policy</u>.&quot; (50) And this self-identification in turn leads to the definition of not only &quot;tangible&quot; foreign powers but global contingency and uncertainty per se as threats. For example, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush repeatedly said that &quot;the enemy [of America] is unpredictability. The enemy is instability.&quot; (51) Similarly, arguing for the continuation of U.S. Cold War alliances, a high-ranking Pentagon official asked, &quot;if we pull out, who knows what nervousness will result?&quot; (52) Thus understood, <u>by its very uncertain character, China would now automatically constitute a threat to the United States</u>. For example, Bernstein and Munro believe that &quot;China's political unpredictability, the always-present possibility that it will fall into a state of domestic disunion and factional fighting,&quot; constitutes a source of danger. (53) In like manner, Richard Betts and Thomas Christensen write: If the PLA [People's Liberation Army] remains second-rate, should the world breathe a sigh of relief? Not entirely.... <u>Drawing China into the web of global interdependence may do more to encourage peace than war, but it cannot guarantee that the pursuit of heartfelt political interests will be blocked by a fear of economic consequences.... U.S. efforts to create a stable balance across the Taiwan Strait might deter the use of force under certain circumstances, but certainly not all</u>. (54) The upshot, therefore, is that <u>since China displays no absolute certainty for peace, it must be, by definition, an uncertainty, and hence, a threat.</u> In the same way, a multitude of other unpredictable factors (such as ethnic rivalry, local insurgencies, overpopulation, drug trafficking, environmental degradation, rogue states, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and international terrorism) have also been labeled as &quot;threats&quot; to U.S. security. Yet, it seems that in the post-Cold War environment, China represents a kind of uncertainty par excellence. &quot;<u>Whatever the prospects for a more peaceful, more democratic, and more just world order, nothing seems more uncertain today than the future of post-Deng China</u>,&quot; (55) argues Samuel Kim. And such <u>an archetypical uncertainty is crucial to the enterprise of U.S. self-construction, because it seems that only an uncertainty with potentially global consequences such as China could justify U.S. indispensability or its continued world dominance</u>. In this sense, Bruce Cumings aptly suggested in 1996 <u>that China (as a threat) was basically &quot;a metaphor for an enormously expensive Pentagon that has lost its bearings and that requires a formidable 'renegade state' to define its mission</u> (Islam is rather vague, and Iran lacks necessary weights).&quot; (56)<br />

I. <u>Current Chinese Nuclear Policy It can be safely said that of all the nuclear states, the nuclear policy of China has so far been the most consistent. From the day China first exploded an atomic bomb, its nuclear policy-related statements have remained unchanged. Five major components can be derived from these statements: No First Use Policy No first use (NFU) has been most frequently and consistently repeated in numerous Chinese government statements ever since China became a nuclear weapon state in 1964</u>. By conceding the first use option, <u>China has limited itself to retaliatory nuclear use only</u>. China has also called all nuclear weapon states to commit themselves to a NFU policy at any time and in any circumstances. <u>Security Assurance to Non Nuclear Weapons States and Nuclear Free Zones China has been very critical of the use of nuclear threats against non-nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapons zones</u>. It has repeatedly called on all the nuclear weapon states to agree to a legally-binding, multilateral agreement under which they would pledge not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states and nuclear free zone<u>s.</u> <u>This policy component limits China’s potential nuclear adversaries to just the few nuclear weapon states. Apart from the negative security assurance, which China gives unconditionally to all non-nuclear weapon states, China issued its first formal positive security assurance with the other four declared nuclear weapon states in April 1995, promising to come to the aid of any non-nuclear weapon state subject to nuclear attack</u> and pursue appropriate punishment against the attacking state, under the auspices of the UN Security Council. This policy has become part of the UN Security Council Resolution 984. Limited Development of Second Strike, Retaliatory Capability <u>China has repeated its intention to maintain a very small nuclear arsenal on many occasions.</u> In its 2003 Defense White Paper, <u>China states that it “has always exercised utmost restraint on the development of nuclear weapons, and its nuclear arsenal is kept at the lowest level necessary for self-defense only.</u>”[1] However, t<u>o make this small arsenal a credible deterrent, China has to make it survivable to a first nuclear strike, even that strike is overwhelming and devastating.</u> In Chinese literature, “<u>few but effective” (jinggan youxiao) are the words most frequently used to describe its necessary arsenal. Opposition to Nuclear Deployment outside National Territories China is opposed to the policy of extended nuclear deterrence, or the policy of providing &quot;nuclear umbrellas&quot; by nuclear weapon states to their allies. In consistence with China’s long standing policy of not sending or stationing any troops outside China, it is also officially opposed to the deployment of nuclear weapons outside national territories,</u> and has stated that China will never deployed nuclear weapons on any foreign soil. Complete Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and Thorough Nuclear Disarmament China first called for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons in its proposal for a world summit in1963, before its first nuclear explosion. <u>On the same day of China’s first nuclear explosion, it again stated that “the Chinese government hereby solemnly proposes to the governments of the world that a summit conference of all the countries of the world be convened to discuss the questions of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and that as the first step, the summit conference conclude an agreement to the effect that the nuclear powers and those countries which may soon become nuclear powers undertake not to use nuclear weapons either against non-nuclear countries and nuclear-free zones or against each other</u>.&quot;[2] This has evolved into China’s basic position on nuclear disarmament and it has never given up its efforts to promote an international convention to ban nuclear weapons. <u>The above major components of Chinese nuclear policy, if interpreted through the lens of Western deterrence terminology, can be characterized as: Strategic Rather than Operational and Tactical Deterrence Mao Zedong, in elaborating China's reason to develop nuclear weapons</u>, said “we will not only have possession of more aircraft and artillery pieces, but also atom bombs. In today’s world, we must have this thing if we don’t want to be bullied by others.”[3] <u>The original purpose of nuclear development in China was to “break up the nuclear threat and smash the nuclear blackmai</u>l (dabuo he weixie, fensui he ezha).” <u>As a political instrument, nuclear weapons are to be utilized mainly at the level of grand strategy, not as a winning tool in military operations</u>. The military value of nuclear weapons lies only in its deterrent effect against nuclear attack. The officially declared missions of the Second Artillery Force are twofold: T<u>o deter the use of nuclear weapons against China, and To launch an effective nuclear counter-attack in the case of such an attack.</u>[4] No distinction has been made in categorizing nuclear operations. A nuclear strike against China—whether conducted at strategic, operational or tactical level, with high or low yield warheads, or deadly or tolerable lethality—is perceived as the utmost form of warfare in Chinese war categorization, which must be responded strategically. In Chinese strategic literature, we only see the discussion on how to deter a nuclear war from happening, on how to prevent a conventional conflict from escalating into a nuclear war, and how to retaliate after suffering a nuclear attack—but never how to win a nuclear war. <u>The primary Chinese perception is that nuclear wars are not to be won, but to be prevented. Retaliatory—Rather than Denial—Deterrence</u>[5] Many Chinese cite Deng Xiaoping when explaining China's nuclear thinking. He explained, in a meeting with foreigners in 1983: &quot;<u>While you have some deterrence force, we also have some; but we don't want much. It will do just to possess it. Things like strategic weapons and deterrence forces are there to scare others. They must not be used first. But our possession will have some effect. The limited possession of nuclear weapons itself exert some pressure. It remains our position that we will develop a little (nuclear weapons). But the development will be limited</u>. We have said repeatedly that our small amount (of nuclear weapons) is nothing. It is only to show that we also have what you have. If you want to destroy us, you yourself have to suffer some punishment at the same time.&quot;[6] Deng’s statement echoed Mao’s nuclear thinking in several aspects: Nuclear weapons are desirable only for its deterrent value, not for battlefield utility. Nuclear weapons, if ever used, will be used to cause the enemy as much pain as possible, so as to enhance its deterrent value in the first place. Therefore, China has to adopt counter-value as opposed to counterforce targeting strategies, in order to strengthen its deterrence posture. Only a small number of nuclear weapons will satisfy China’s deterrent needs—to convince potential nuclear adversary of a possible nuclear retaliation. Both Mao and Deng are very explicit that the deterrent effectiveness does not increase in proportion with numbers of nuclear weapons. A survivable and invulnerable small arsenal can be equally effective in terms of deterrence. Deterrence effect depends on invulnerability to nuclear strikes, not on large amount of nuclear attack capabilities. Accordingly, what China has been seeking is a nuclear arsenal that is small in size but good in quality. <u>As confined by its adherence to NFU policy, China has to focus its nuclear development efforts on “second strike capabilities” which must be credible and survivable in order to have deterrent effect.</u> Central Rather than Extended Deterrence[7] By declaring to counter-attack with nuclear weapons only after being attacked by nuclear weapons, China has preserved nuclear capabilities to protect its own most vital interests—that is, the existence of the nation. Even during the Cold War years, China has never provided nuclear umbrella to any other country in the world. <u>For China, the concept of extended deterrence has simply not entered into it nuclear calculus—yet. General Rather than Immediate Deterrence The mutual deterrence exercised by the two nuclear superpowers during the Cold War had been directed at one another.</u> They were both 69the ones to deter, and the ones to be deterred. They <u>formed a bilateral deterrent relationship, in which each side was very clear whom it wanted to deter, and what it wanted to deter them from. Their deterrence was more of an immediate nature.</u> China had never comfortably fitted into the bipolar context. It had been in one of the poles for some time, then outside of both poles for some time, and then it tried to be closer to the other pole. In addition, China had not had the luxury of a nuclear umbrella for most of the Cold War years. <u>Therefore, China’s nuclear deterrence had been more of a general nature—in which China tried to form a multilateral deterrent relationship with all the nuclear powers, which only made clear what China wanted to deter.</u> Defensive <u>Rather than Offensive Deterrence One famous tenet laid down by Chairman Mao Zedong is the Sixteen Character Guideline for the use of force—“We will never attack unless we are attacked; and if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack</u>” (ren bu fan wo, wo bu fan ren; ren ruo fan wo, wo bi fan ren). Behind this guideline is a sober headed analysis of power balances. The PLA and its predecessors entered and won most wars as an inferior side against great odds. So a defensive posture had always been preferred to an offensive one. However, Chinese forces have managed to turn from being the weaker into the stronger party in the course—usually a protracted course—of previous conventional wars. <u>When applied to nuclear policy, this Guideline simply means a rejection of preemptive thinking. The renunciation of the first-use option, the willingness to accept vulnerability, the confinement to retaliatory nuclear use, the principle of attacking only after being attacked</u> (hou fa zi ren), the focus on second strike capabilities, and the reservation of nuclear means as the last resort to protect only the most vital national interests, all point to the defensiveness of China’s nuclear policy. <u>Although nuclear weapons are inherently offensive weapons, when deterrence strategies are applied in the way China does, they acquire a pure defensive posture</u>. Minimum Rather than Limited or Maximum Deterrence If I am to choose from Western deterrence classifications to describe Chinese nuclear deterrence posture in general, I would have to use the handy concept of “minimum deterrence” as compared to maximum or limited deterrence. Personally, I think the word “minimum” has too strong a quantitative connotation that is misleading. It sometimes suggests a quantitative standard instead of a qualitative standard. The word “minimum” has for some time been officially used in Chinese government documents.[8] <u>But what I want to emphasize is that Chinese strategists take the concept as a relative one, defined not only by pure numbers, but more importantly by such key criteria as invulnerability of nuclear forces, assurance of retaliation, and credibility of counter-attack.</u> When a Chinese document says that China intends to possess nuclear weapons only at the minimum (or lowest) level for the needs of self-defense, that means to have the minimum but assured capabilities for a retaliatory second strike. Some studies have suggested a shift of Chinese nuclear posture toward limited deterrence, where China could employ nuclear weapons to deter both conventional and nuclear wars, and even to exercise escalation control in the event of a conventional confrontation.[9] Ho<u>wever, the basic logic of China’s nuclear thinking dictates nuclear weapons as deterring—not as a means of winning against nuclear weapons.</u><br />

However, BMD uniquely causes modernization<br />
1) Taiwan<br />
Taiwan reunification is China’s primary security concern- U.S. deployment of missile defense to contain China kills any diplomacy<br />
Pan 4 [Chengxin, is Lecturer in International Relations at Deakin University, Australia; The &quot;China Threat&quot; in American Self-Imagination: The Discursive Construction of Other as Power Politics Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, Vol. 29, 2004. /HN]<br />
This is not to imply that the kind of perspectives outlined above will automatically be translated into actual China policy, but one does not have to be exceedingly perceptive to note that the &quot;China threat&quot; perspective does exert enormous influence on U.S. policy making on China. To illustrate this point, <u>I want now to examine some specific implications of U.S. representations of the &quot;China threat&quot; for U.S.-China relations in relation to the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis and the &quot;spy plane&quot; incident of 2001</u>. Theory as Practice 1: The Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis <u>In the eyes of many U.S. China watchers, China's approach to the Taiwan question is a microcosm of its grand strategy to dominate Asia.</u> The argument is that nowhere is the threatening ambition more palpable than in China's saber-rattling missile tests near Taiwan's coast in 1995-1996, in <u>addition to its long-standing refusal to renounce the use of force as a last resort to settle the dispute. (72) While the 1995-1996 missile crisis has been a favorite &quot;starting point&quot; for many pundits and practitioners to paint a frightening picture of China and to justify U.S. firm response to it, what is often conveniently overlooked is the question of how the &quot;China threat&quot; discourse itself had played a constitutive role in the lead-up to that crisis. Limits of space forbid exploring this complex issue here.</u> Simply put, <u>the Taiwan question was created largely as a result of widespread U.S. perceptions of China as a &quot;Red Menace&quot; in the wake of the &quot;loss of China&quot; and the outbreak of the Korean War.</u> To thwart what it saw as an orchestrated Communist offensive in Asia, <u>the United States deployed the U.S. Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait as part of its Cold War containment strategy, thereby effectively preventing the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. While the United States abandoned its containment and isolation policy toward China in the 1970s and the two countries established full diplomatic relations in 1979, the conventional image of the &quot;Red Menace&quot; lingered on in the United States.</u> To manage such a &quot;threat<u>,&quot; the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act shortly after the normalization of U.S.-China relations, renewing U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense even though diplomatic ties with the island had been severed. (73) This confrontational policy serves not only to shore up Taiwan's defense capabilities but also to induce its independent ambition and further complicate cross-strait relations</u>. As former U.S. defense official Chas Freeman remarked, &quot;U.S. arms sales to Taiwan no longer work to boost Taipei's confidence that it can work out its differences with Beijing. Instead, <u>they bolster the view that Taiwan can go its own way</u>.&quot; (74) For instance, amid growing sympathy from the Republican-dominated Congress and the elite media as well as the expanded ties with the United States, Taiwan responded coolly to Beijing's call for dialogue in January 1995. In June 1995, Taiwan's flexible diplomacy, designed to burnish its independent image, culminated in its president Lee Teng-hui's high-profile visit to the United States. <u>This in turn reinforced Beijing's suspicion that the real U.S. intention was to frustrate its reunification goal, leaving it apparently no other choice but to prepare militarily for what it saw as a worst-case scenario</u>. All this constituted the major context in which the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait missile exercises took place. For most Chinese, the carrying out of these military exercises, well within their own territory, had little to do with attacking Taiwan, much less with challenging U.S. security interests in the western Pacific, <u>Rather, it was about China's long-cherished dream of national unity, with its &quot;sabre rattling&quot; tactics serving merely as a warning to the United States, as well as to Taiwan</u>. However, interpreting such exercises as China's muscle-flexing with direct security implications for the region, <u>with &quot;an almost 19th-century display of gunboat diplomacy,&quot; (75) the United States dispatched two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers to the region of Taiwan. While not denying the potential security repercussions of China's missile tests for the region, I <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">suggest that the flashpoint of Taiwan says as much about the danger of this U.S. approach to China as about the threat of Beijing's display of force itself</span></u>. &quot;Had Bill Clinton projected a constancy of purpose and vision in China policy ... in 1993-1994,&quot; David M. Lampton argues, &quot;he might not have been challenged in the Taiwan Strait in 1995-1996 with missile exercises.&quot; (76) Indeed, it was primarily in the context of this U.S. intervention that Zhongguo keyi shuo bu (China can say no), one of the most anti-U.S. books ever produced in China, emerged and quickly became a best-seller in the Chinese reading world. (77) Mean-while<u>, some Chinese strategic thinkers were so alarmed by the U.S. show of strength that they told Helmut Sonnenfeldt, one of Henry Kissinger's close associates, that they were rereading the early works of George F. Kennan because &quot;containment had been the basis of American policy toward the Soviet Union; now that the United States was turning containment against China, they wanted to learn how it had started and evolved</u>.&quot; (78) <u>If such a scary interaction between the United States and China remained somehow obscured here, it would soon be manifested again in another standoff in U.S.-China relations</u>; namely, the spy-plane incident of 2001. Theory as Practice 2: The 2001 Spy-Plane Incident Following <u>the 1995-1996 missile crisis, mainstream China observers have continued to take the Taiwan question as a purely geopolitical or security issue</u>, which accordingly should be understood and dealt with simply from the time-honored balance-of-power, zero-sum game perspectives. For example<u>, Bernstein and Munro insist that Taiwan's reunification with the mainland &quot;will leave China in possession of yet another immense economic prize</u>.... Complete Chinese reunification, in other words, would further upset the balance of power and vastly enhance China's economic and strategic strength.&quot; (79) <u>Commenting on this typical way of representing the Taiwan question, the Taiwan-based scholar Chih-yu Shih suggests that the national security analysis may seem to be a more tangible approach to dissecting the rationale behind Beijing's &quot;policy of coercion&quot; and, because it appears sensible to us, can alleviate our need to pursue Beijing's motivations more deeply. Not only can we thus camouflage our embarrassment at not really knowing China, but also Beijing's discomforting behavioural patterns become comfortably familiar.</u> (80) Clearly, the practical implications of this kind of representation go far beyond that. After perceiving a power imbalance in the Taiwan Strait in favor of China, James Lilley (former U.S. ambassador to China) and Carl Ford proposed: &quot;The name of the game for Taiwan, then, is deterrence,&quot; which means that the United States must help Taiwan's military maintain &quot;a qualitative edge over the PRC.&quot; (81) <u>The 2002 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Security Review Commission reached similar conclusions, recommending, among other things, &quot;deterring China attacking Taiwan&quot; and &quot;supporting Taiwan's ability to defend itself without outside assistance.&quot;</u> In its formal conclusion, the review commission, made up of well-known U.S. China experts as well as influential policymakers, <u>vows to continue monitoring China in every aspect relating to &quot;our national security concerns.&quot;</u> (82) In fact, U.S. monitoring activity, such as conducting reconnaissance flights along Chinese borders, had always been part of its China policy. So went the rationale<u>: The Chinese say they have the right to use force to reclaim Taiwan because it belongs to them, and they regularly practice for an invasion. This threat of force is why on April 1st [2001], the U.S. Navy's EP-3 surveillance plane was in the area to monitor China's military preparations. (83) Yet it turned out that the EP-3 spy plane collided with a Chinese navy fighter jet that was tailing it over the South China Sea, some fifty miles from the coast of China's Hainan Province. The Chinese jet crashed into the waters below, while the crippled spy plane landed on Hainan island.</u> Washington demanded immediate return of its crew and plane, while Beijing insisted that the United States bear the responsibility for the midair collision and apologize for the incident. <u>Rather than reflecting on how their new containment policy might have contributed to this incident in the first place, many U.S. realist analysts hastily interpreted it as further objective proof of the long-suspected &quot;China threat.&quot;</u> As Allen S. Whiting put it, the collision &quot;focused attention anew on Beijing's willingness to risk the use of force in pursuit of political objectives.&quot; (84) <u>It was as if the whole incident had little to do with U.S. spying, which was seen as &quot;routine&quot; and &quot;normal.&quot;</u> Instead, it was the Chinese who were said to be &quot;playing a dangerous game,&quot; without regard to the old spy etiquette formulated during the Cold War. (85) For other observers, China's otherness was embodied also in its demand for a U.S. apology. For example, Merle Goldman, a history professor at Boston University, said that the Chinese emphasis on apologies was rooted in the Confucian value system: &quot;This kind of internalized consensus was the way China was ruled for thousands of years.&quot; (86) From this perspective, China's request for an apology was preordained by a fixed Chinese tradition and national psyche and had nothing whatsoever to do with the specific context of this incident in which China was spied on, its sovereignty violated, and one of its pilots lost. Thus, even in the face of such a potentially explosive incident, the self-fulfilling effect of the &quot;China threat&quot; discourse has not been acknowledged by mainstream U.S. China analysts. To the contrary, deterring and containing China has gained new urgency. For example, in the aftermath of this standoff, neoconservative columnists Robert Kagan and William Kristol (chairman of the Project for the New American Century) wrote that <u>&quot;not only is the sale of Aegis [to Taiwan] ... the only appropriate response to Chinese behavior; We have been calling for the active containment of China for the past six years precisely because we think it is the only way to keep the peace.&quot; (87) Although the sale of the Aegis destroyers was deferred, President George W. Bush approved an arms package for Taiwan that included so-called &quot;defensive&quot; weapons such as four Kidd class destroyers, eight diesel submarines, and twelve P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft, as well as minesweeping helicopters, torpedoes, and amphibious assault vehicles.</u> On this arms sale, David Shambaugh, a Washington-based China specialist, had this to say: <u>&quot;Given the tangible threats that the Chinese military can present to Taiwan--particularly a naval blockade or quarantine and missile threats--this is a sensible and timely package.&quot; (88) Given the danger and high stakes involved, some may wonder why China did not simply cooperate so that there would be no need for U.S. &quot;containment.&quot; To some extent, China has been cooperative.</u> For example, Beijing was at pains to calm a disgruntled Chinese public by explaining that the U.S. &quot;sorry&quot; letter issued at the end of the spy-plane incident was a genuine &quot;apology,&quot; with U.S. officials openly rejecting that interpretation. <u>On the Taiwan question, China has dropped many of its previous demands</u> (such as &quot;one China&quot; being defined as the People's Republic). As <u>to the South China Sea, China has allowed the ASEAN Regional Forum to seek a negotiated solution to the Spratly Islands dispute and also agreed to join the Philippines as cochairs of the working group on confidence-building measures.</u> (89) In January 2002, China chose to play down an incident that a presidential jet outfitted in the United States had been crammed with sophisticated satellite-operated bugs, a decision that, as the New York Times puts it, &quot;<u>illustrates the depth of China's current commitment to cultivating better relations with the United States.&quot; (90) Also, over the years, China has ratified a number of key nonproliferation treaties and pledged not to assist countries in developing missiles with ranges that exceed the limits established under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). More recently, China has collaborated with the United States in the war on terrorism,</u> including issuing new regulations to restrict the export of missile technology to countries usually accused by the United States of aiding terrorists. Indeed, as some have argued, by any reasonable measure China is now more responsible in international affairs than at any time since 1949. (91) And <u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">yet, the real problem is that, so long as the United States continues to stake its self-identity on the realization of absolute security, no amount of Chinese cooperation would be enough. </span>For instance, Iain Johnston views the constructive development of China's arms-control policy as a kind of &quot;realpolitik adaptation,&quot; rather than &quot;genuine learning</u>.&quot; (92) From this perspective, however China has changed, it would remain a fundamentally threatening other, which the United States cannot live with but has to take full control of. I have argued above that the &quot;China threat&quot; argument in mainstream U.S. IR literature is derived, primarily, from a discursive construction of otherness. This construction is predicated on a particular narcissistic understanding of the U.S. self and on a positivist-based realism, concerned with absolute certainty and security, a concern central to the dominant U.S. self-imaginary. Within these frameworks, it seems imperative that China be treated as a threatening, absolute other since it is unable to fit neatly into the U.S.-led evolutionary scheme or guarantee absolute security for the United States, so that U.S. power preponderance in the post-Cold War world can still be legitimated. Not only does this reductionist representation come at the expense of understanding China as a dynamic, multifaceted country but it leads inevitably to a policy of containment that, in turn, tends to enhance the influence of realpolitik thinking, nationalist extremism, and hard-line stance in today's China. <u>Even a small dose of the containment strategy is likely to have a highly dramatic impact on U.S.-China relations, as the 1995-1996 missile crisis and the 2001 spy-plane incident have vividly attested</u>. In this respect, Chalmers Johnson is right when he suggests that &quot;a policy of containment toward China implies the possibility of war, just as it did during the Cold War vis-a-vis the former Soviet Union. The balance of terror prevented war between the United States and the Soviet Union, but this may not work in the case of China.&quot; (93) <u>For instance, as the United States presses ahead with a missile-defence shield to &quot;guarantee&quot; its invulnerability from rather unlikely sources of missile attacks, it would be almost certain to intensify China's sense of vulnerability and compel it to expand its current small nuclear arsenal so as to maintain the efficiency of its limited deterrence. In consequence, it is not impossible that the two countries, and possibly the whole region, might be dragged into an escalating arms race that would eventually make war more likely</u>. Neither the United States nor China is likely to be keen on fighting the other. But as has been demonstrated, the &quot;China threat&quot; argument, for all its alleged desire for peace and security, tends to make war preparedness the most &quot;realistic&quot; option for both sides. At this juncture, worthy of note is an interesting comment made by Charlie Neuhauser, a leading CIA China specialist, on the Vietnam War, a war fought by the United States to contain the then-Communist &quot;other.&quot; Neuhauser says, &quot;Nobody wants it. We don't want it, Ho Chi Minh doesn't want it; it's simply a question of annoying the other side.&quot; (94) And, as we know, in an unwanted war some fifty-eight thousand young people from the United States and an estimated two million Vietnamese men, women, and children lost their lives. Therefore, to call for a halt to the vicious circle of theory as practice associated <u>with the &quot;China threat&quot; literature, tinkering with the current positivist-dominated U.S. IR scholarship on China is no longer adequate. Rather, what is needed is to question this un-self-reflective scholarship itself, particularly its connections with the dominant way in which the United States and the West in general represent themselves and others via their positivist epistemology, so that alternative, more nuanced, and less dangerous ways of interpreting and debating China might become possible.</u><br />

Upper tier BMD is perceived as Taiwan-Japan alliance- causes quick modernization<br />
Hughes 6[Christopher W. Hughes, Principal Research Fellow &amp; Acting Co-Director at the Centre for the Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation at the University of Warwick, December 2006, “Ballistic Missile Defence and US-Japan and US-UK Alliances Compared”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:7889:http://www.garnet-eu.org/fileadmin/documents/working_papers/1106.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.garnet-eu.org/fileadmin/documents/working_papers/1106.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.garnet-eu.org/fileadmin/documents/working_papers/1106.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:7889 -->]<br />
<u>Japan’s existing security dilemma</u> vis-à-vis North Korea is well known. Japan’s participation in BMD, although not likely to stimulate the North’s already on-going missile programme which is so vital to its diplomatic and military campaign to break out of its international isolation, is also unlikely to curb the North’s build-up of its missile forces, and this is despite opinions which see BMD as a means to convince the North of the futility of threatening Japan and the US. Instead, <u>the principal security dilemma that BMD is likely to exacerbate for Japan is that visàvis China. Chinese policy-makers are concerned that Japan’s development of a BMD 25 system developed in conjunction with the US could lead to the negation of its nuclear deterrent by providing Japan with both a ‘spear’ and ‘shield’</u>. The spear of the US extended nuclear deterrent would be complemented by a BMD shield, allowing Japan deterrence by both punishment and denial vis-à-vis China. Chinese <u>fears might in part be justified as the Aegis BMD system may have some residual or ‘break out’ capabilities to defend against its inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMS), and certainly the US regards the Aegis/SMD component of its missile defence as part of a defensive shield against ICBMs</u>.25 <u>China in all likelihood though could overcome the negation of its strategic nuclear arsenal through the employment of countermeasures and development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV) to overwhelm any BMD system</u>. China’s concerns extend also to the <u>Japan’s possible countering of its tactical ballistic missiles and involvement in the Taiwan issue</u>. China’s <u>worst case scenario would be Japan’s deployment either individually or in conjunction with the US of its sea-mobile NTWD system to defend Taiwan in a future crisis situation. In particular, China would fear the formation of a quasi-alliance amongst the US, Japan and Taiwan. For if the US were to sell AWS and BMD technology to Taiwan, this could result in all three powers being equipped with fully interoperable equipment, so smoothing the way for three-way military cooperation</u>. Japan’s reluctance to become embroiled directly in a Taiwan Straits crisis makes this an unlikely scenario except in circumstances of a full scale conflict. <u>Far more likely is that Japan would utilise its BMD system to defend US forces operating in a Taiwan Straits crisis from bases in Japan; an action that would complicate any attempts by China to intimidate US forces in the region short of initiating a war also against Japan. China can ultimately overcome any BMD system through increasing production of its missiles; a process that is relatively cheap and likely to saturate and overcome any defence. Therefore, Japan’s interest in BMD, although not initiating the process, carries the risk of accelerating China’s upgrading of its nuclear and conventional ballistic missile capabilities and generating further momentum for a regional arms race</u>.<br />

US-Japan TMD cooperation will lead to war over Taiwan – lowers peace talks and encourages Taiwanese independence<br />
Kiziah, Professor at US Air Force Academy, 2k [Rex, Lt. Col. USAF, US-Led Cooperative Theater Missile Defense in Northeast Asia, Air War College, Scholar]<br />
Perhaps the <u>most important complicating issue between the United States, China, and Japan with respect to the current US-Japanese plans for cooperative TMD development is China’s view of this effort with respect to Taiwan</u>. Ultimately, the Chinese leadership would like to regain control of what it considers to be a renegade province. For 20 THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE <u>China, unification with Taiwan is a cherished national goal. In the past China’s leaders have threatened the use of force if Taiwan formally declared independence, a Chinese government white paper released in February 2000 broadened the reasons that Beijing considered would justify the use of military force—specifically</u>, “if Taiwan’s authorities refused indefinitely ‘the peaceful settlement of cross-Straits reunification through negotiations.’ ”56 <u>Believing that a US-Japan TMD system will also be clearly designed to counter China’s ballistic missiles, then it would eliminate Beijing’s only credible military option to bring Taipei to the negotiating table on China’s terms. Reinforcing this belief is the joint US-Japanese decision to pursue</u> <u>R&amp;D on an upper-tier, NTW-like TMD system. Such a ship-based system would have wide-area defensive coverage and be highly mobile; it could therefore be moved quickly to thwart Chinese actions against Taiwan.</u> The Chinese argue that, <u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">even if there is no US or Japanese intent at the present time to use a missile defense system to protect Taiwan in the event of a cross-strait crisis, a shipbased TMD system will clearly provide the United States and Japan such a capability which they may then choose to use</span></u>. Furthermore, <u>based on extensive interviews conducted in 1996 and 1998 with military and civilian analysts in Chinese government think tanks and academicians at leading Chinese institutions, Christensen concludes that Chinese officials view the Japanese as more likely than the United States to oppose Taiwan’s reintegration with the mainland. Christensen supports his conclusion with the following: Taiwan is a former Japanese colony (1895–1945). It is near international sea-lanes that are important to Japan.</u> In addition, . . . <u>Japan has a strategic interest in preventing Taiwan’s high-technology and capital-rich economy from linking politically with the mainland</u>. Moreover, <u>some Chinese analysts view Taiwan as having geostrategic significance for Japan as a potential ally because of its location near the Chinese mainland</u>.57 <u>Perhaps of even greater concern to Beijing than the use of missile defenses by the United States or Japan in a possible future China-Taiwan contingency is that defensive weapons, such as a TMD system, deployed by Taiwan’s allies and friends may bolster Taiwanese leadership’s confiKIZIAH 21 dence to declare permanent independence from China</u>.58 <u>Preventing Taiwan from legitimizing the current territorial status quo, that is, de facto independence, is a high-priority Chinese security goal as evidenced by their ever increasing coastal ballistic missile deployments near Taiwan and their frequent veiled threats indicating a willingness to risk war to prevent others from intervening in their internal affairs.</u> And <u>Beijing’s concerns and rhetoric do not appear to be diminished by the US’s “three no’s” policy that includes no support for Taiwan’s independence</u><br />

<span class="underline0">The doomsday scenario</span> THE high-intensity scenario <span class="underline0">postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China</span>. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then <span class="underline0">a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict</span> on such a scale <span class="underline0">would embroil other countries</span> far <span class="underline0">and</span> near and -- horror of horrors -- <span class="underline0">raise the possibility of a nuclear war</span>. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, <span class="underline0">east Asia will be set on fire.</span> And the conflagration may not end there <span class="underline0">as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. </span>With the US distracted, <span class="underline0">Russia may</span> seek to <span class="underline0">redefine Europe's</span> political <span class="underline0">landscape</span>. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, <span class="underline0">hostilities between India and Pakistan</span>, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, <span class="underline0">could enter a new and dangerous phase</span>. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, <span class="underline0">there is little hope of winning a war against China</span> 50 years later, <span class="underline0">short of using nuclear weapons</span>. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that <span class="underline0">should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation</span>. There would be no victors in such a war. While <span class="underline0">the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan </span>might seem inconceivable, it <span class="underline0">cannot be ruled out</span> entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.<br />

Block 2A upgrades make Japanese BMD an effective ASAT<br />

<span class="underline0">One major issue</span> <span class="small">that</span> <span class="underline0">is</span> <span class="small">not being talked about in regard to this new plan is the implications it has for</span> <span class="underline0">space security</span><span class="small">. Space security has many definitions. In the US, it is commonly defined as protecting space assets and capabilities. In Europe, most would define it as using space capabilities to enable human security on Earth. More broadly, it can also be defined as protecting the long-term sustainability of and access to the space environment for continued socioeconomic benefits. All of these definitions are valid and may be in play at different times for different people. Many people assume that space security inevitably means a ban on space weapons or military activities in space. However, that is not true and there are many different perspectives on this. For example, from the perspective of space sustainability, only those space weapons that adversely affect the space environment, such as kinetic energy interceptors, would be seen as something to control or ban. Many states also recognize the difference between militarization and weaponization of space, and increasingly define peaceful uses as non-aggressive instead of non-military.</span> <span class="underline0">At the heart of the relationship between BMD and space security is the issue of dual-use technology</span><span class="small">. Broadly defined, these are technologies</span> <span class="underline0">that have both a legitimate defensive use and potential military weapons application</span><span class="small">. Now, this definition has its issues—many would argue that everything is potentially dual-use, such as a pencil that could be used to both write and stab. But an essential element of arms control and proliferation is the concept that certain technologies are important (and potentially dangerous) enough that they require special controls. This was behind the addition of many space-related items to the United States Munitions List (USML) after two US companies were fined for providing technical help to China on space launch vehicles, which allegedly also benefited their ballistic missile program in the 1990s. The USML contains many technologies and articles that fall under export controls. A current example of this issue of dual use is North Korea’s ballistic missile program. The DPRK maintains the position that its space program is solely for peaceful purposes and is geared towards developing space launch capability, something that many other sovereign States have pursued in the past. However, it is also the case that much of the same technology behind space launch vehicles is also applicable to ICBMs capable of carrying a WMD payload (see “A space launch vehicle by any other name…”, The Space Review, March 9, 2009).</span> <span class="underline0">The same dual-use argument can be made for several technologies being used for BMD. The same kinetic-kill interceptors that can destroy a missile in-flight could also be capable of destroying a satellite</span> <span class="small">in low Earth orbit (</span><span class="underline0">and in doing so, effectively become</span> <span class="small">anti-satellite weapons, or</span> <span class="underline0">ASATs</span><span class="small">). This was unequivocally demonstrated by the previously mentioned Operation Burnt Frost, which only required minor modifications, reportedly just software, to an existing Aegis SM-3 interceptor to destroy a satellite (USA-193), albeit one that was in the initial stages of atmospheric re-entry.</span> <span class="underline0">There are limits on the utility of BMD systems as ASATs: the maximum speed of the interceptor limits the maximum altitude at which it can attack satellites</span><span class="small">. In the case of the SM-3 Block 1A, its maximum velocity is reportedly around 3 km/s. This gives it a maximum ballistic flight range of about 1000 kilometers and a maximum theoretical ASAT altitude of about 500 kilometers, about twice the altitude of 240 kilometers at which it destroyed USA-193.</span> <span class="underline0">However, the newer Block</span> <span class="small">1B and</span> <span class="underline0">2A of the SM-3 will have a much greater burnout velocity and thus increased ASAT engagement altitude, reportedly around 4.5 km/s</span> <span class="small">for Block 2A.</span> <span class="underline0">This would allow it to reach satellites throughout</span> <span class="small">low</span> <span class="underline0">Earth orbit</span><span class="small">, up to a theoretical altitude of around 2000 kilometers. From this it is clear that</span> <span class="underline0">as BMD interceptors increase their maximum velocity to be able to intercept ICBMs, they also increase in potential ASAT capability. </span><br />

Current BMD can’t take out ICBMs – that expansion necessitates Chinese space modernization<br />

<span class="boldunderline">Missile defense is one important step toward U.S. space control</span>. <span class="underline0">The United States has promoted the development and deployment of missile defense</span>, <span class="underline0">particularly of an integrated, layered system, and it has increased the budgets for missile defense programs</span>. Since 2004, the United States has begun deployment of a ground-based midcourse defense (GMD) system. The system—comprised of seven interceptors in Alaska and another two in California—was activated in the summer of 2006. As many scientists and experts in the United States have pointed out, <span class="underline0">this initial GMD system would likely be ineffective against a real attack by long-range ballistic missiles</span>13; <span class="underline0">however, from a Chinese perspective, there is no guarantee that the system would not someday, with the help of a breakthrough technology, become effective</span>. Moreover, <span class="underline0">this GMD system could be the first step toward a more robust, layered system, capable of targeting missiles at various points in their flight trajectories. </span>Some <span class="underline0">Chinese observers view this GMD system as a space weaponry system</span>. <span class="underline0">The scope of space weaponry</span>, <span class="underline0">as</span> generally <span class="underline0">defined in China</span>, <span class="underline0">includes</span> not only space-based weapons, but also <span class="underline0">any weapons that target objects in outer space, regardless of where they are based</span>. <span class="underline0">Objects in outer space would include satellites as well as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs</span>) traveling through outer space.14 Because this GMD system would intercept its target at an altitude that China has defined as outer space (above 100 km), it would be considered space weaponry. <span class="boldunderline">Many Chinese feel that the U.S. plan to deploy a missile defense system is an intentional first step toward space weaponization</span>. Most important, controlling space requires ASAT weapons to negate an adversary’s space capabilities, including their satellites. <span class="underline0">Even if the GMD system does not effectively intercept incoming missiles, it will have an inherent anti-satellite capability</span>.15Many experts realize that <span class="underline0">it is technically easier to intercept a satellite than to kill a ballistic missile</span>. As Bruce DeBlois and his colleagues explain, “Almost <span class="underline0">any midcourse missile defense system could threaten satellites, which are more fragile and </span>more predictable (and therefore <span class="underline0">easier to hit</span>) <span class="underline0">than ballistic missile warheads</span>.”16 The SBL, kinetic kill vehicles, GMD system, sea-based midcourse defense system, and theater high altitude area defense (THAAD) system would all be capable of attacking satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and, given an augmented booster, could reach higher orbits as well.17 As David Wright points out, GMD “could intercept a large fraction of those satellites even from two deployment sites.” He further notes that “the <span class="underline0">missile defense tests that have been done so far are much more relevant to demonstrating an ability to intercept satellites than to intercept missile warheads</span>.”18 Aware of this technical reality, <span class="underline0">some in China have argued that the Bush administration’s rush to deploy GMD is primarily motivated by a desire to acquire ASAT capability</span>. Fu Zhigang, the First Secretary of the Permanent on of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to the UN in Geneva, stated, “<span class="underline0">To pursue missile defense programs is part and parcel of the relevant country[’s] long-term strategy to control…outer space.”19 It is not difficult to understand why Chinese officials hold this view</span>. <span class="underline0">To control access to space and defend U.S. space assets requires a missile defense system with global coverage</span>. As shown in some military documents, <span class="underline0">missile defense is considered an important part of U.S. “space control” strategy</span>. For example, the U.S. Space Command document Vision for 2020 made clear that national missile defense is a “key” to “Global Engagement Capabilities.”20 Current U.S. ballistic missile defense (BMD) strategies aim to engage ballistic missiles in all phases—boost, midcourse, and terminal. The 2002 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) included guidance for missile defense program development. The NPR states, “Missile defense is most effective if it is layered; that is, able to intercept ballistic missiles of any range in all phases of their flight.”21 <span class="boldunderline">It is expected that a robust BMD system capable of global coverage would start intercepting an ICBM as early as the boost phase</span>,22 <span class="boldunderline">which would require the use of space weapons such as the SBL and the space-based interceptor</span> (SBI). Both of these systems would be deployed in LEO and used to destroy ICBMs in their boost phase. <span class="underline0">A layered BMD system would also include spacebased sensors, such as early-warning satellites (</span>e.g., Defense Support Program satellites, Space-based Infrared System–High [SBIRS-high]) <span class="underline0">and a space tracking and surveillance system</span> (now STSS, previously referred to as Space-based Infrared System–Low [SBIRS-low]). <span class="boldunderline">Thus, a global BMD system would result in the deployment of weapons in space</span>. In fact, the U.S. Department of Defense indicated in December 2002 that the United States would continue the “development and testing of space-based defenses, specifically space-based kinetic energy (hit to kill) interceptors and advanced target tracking satellites.”23<br />

<span class="small">Any clear-cut distinction between offensive and defense in the TMD context is hopelessly muddied when one realizes that plans for the NTW system include a substantial space component. An elaborate network of space satellites (as well as spaceborne forces to protect them)</span> <span class="underline0">would be essential features of any robust NTW system, providing early warning data of enemy missile launches, as well as tracking information designed to guide SM-3 interceptors to their targets in mid-flight</span><span class="small">. It is instructive to note that politically powerful missile defense proponents such as U.S. Senator Bob “Spaceman” Smith (R-NH) envision NTW integrated into an overall space force that would pursue both defensive and offensive military missions.49 We need to incorporate forward-deployed capabilities like the Navy Theater Wide program and the Air Force Airborne Laser as space-based missile defense programs to ensure [that] we can stop missiles in their boost phase, dropping the debris fallout over our adversary’s homes, not ours…[S]pace offers us…the prospect of inflicting violence—all with great precision and nearly instantaneously, and often more cheaply. With credible offensive and defensive space control, we will deter our adversaries, reassure our allies, and guard our nation’s growing reliance on global commerce.50 This full-throated call for a robust blend of offensive and defensive space weaponry reflects a strategic principle elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens,</span> <span class="underline0">“anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand.”</span><span class="small">51</span> <span class="underline0">The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent “dual capability” of spaceborne weapon components</span><span class="small">. To the extent that</span> <span class="underline0">ballistic missile interceptors</span> <span class="small">based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors</span> <span class="underline0">can</span> <span class="small">also</span> <span class="underline0">be used as orbiting “death stars,” capable of sending munitions hurtling through the earth’s atmosphere at dizzying velocities</span><span class="small">.52 As Marc</span> <span class="underline0">Vidricaire, a member of the Canadian Delegation to the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, explains: “If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land</span><span class="small">.”53 Furthermore,</span> <span class="underline0">spaceborne BMD components can be used for offensive attacks in outer space itself, where orbiting space assets belonging to adversaries could be targeted for destruction</span><span class="small">. According to defense analyst James E. Oberg, “…the benign, defensive nature of a ballistic missile killer is not the only facet of such a system—it also has inherent offensive capability against satellites.”54</span> <span class="underline0">This</span> <span class="small">dual capability of BMD systems</span> <span class="underline0">provides one rationale for why space weapons advocates such as Senator Smith propose to make offensive attack weapons part of missile defense</span><span class="small">. In a world where deployment of purely offensive space weaponry might be difficult to justify as a stand-alone military initiative, Oberg speculates, “the means by which the placement of space-based weapons will likely occur is under a second U.S. space policy directive—that of ballistic missile defense.”55 Although these “death star” scenarios might seem like they come straight out of Hollywood special effects studios,</span> <span class="underline0">it is worth noting that the U.S. Space Command is on record endorsing military strategy that favors weaponization of space</span> <span class="small">as a force multiplier</span> <span class="underline0">for offensive attack missions</span><span class="small">. An official planning document entitled “Vision for 2020” foresees “space-based strike weapons” as part of “global engagement capabilities” designed to enable “application of precision force from, through, and to space.”56 Aggressive pursuit of these “strike weapons” is imperative, according to Space Command officials, because “space superiority is emerging as an essential element of battlefield success and future warfare.”57 Arguing that “it is inevitable that mankind will weaponize space,” Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas D. Bell claims in a 1999 paper that, “The U.S. ability to conduct combat operations in this environment will provide the technical asymmetry that the U.S. will need to win the next war, just as it used strategic bombers and the atomic bomb to win World War II and stealth technology and precision guided munitions to win the Gulf War.”58 These plans recently received concrete expression in comments from Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, Air Force Space Command Commander. While addressing a group at the Joint Tactical Ground Station in South Korea, Eberhart declared that “[s]pace is the ultimate high ground…Not only do we have to use it, we have to be able to defend it and deny our enemy the use of space if we are at war…we have to ensure space superiority for our commanders and men and women who rely on it during the fight.”59</span> <span class="underline0">Although missile defense advocates frequently trumpet the “purely defensive” nature of BMD, such systems exist in</span> <span class="small">a strategic framework</span> <span class="underline0">that ineluctably includes offensive space weaponry</span><span class="small">. “The PR spin is that the U.S. military push into space is about missile defense or defense of U.S. space satellites. But</span> <span class="underline0">the volumes of material coming out of the military are concerned mainly with offense— with using space to establish military domination over the world below</span><span class="small">,” notes professor Karl Grossman.60</span> <span class="underline0">Such</span> <span class="small">a suggestion</span> <span class="underline0">carries particular significance for</span> <span class="small">Japan, since as Frank Umbach, Senior Research Fellow at the German Society of Foreign Affairs, explains, “</span><span class="underline0">a possible Japanese TMD deployment</span> <span class="small">may require an integration of the anti-missile defense command and control (C-2) systems of Japan and the U.S., which could have far-reaching implications for both sides.”61 Eventual deployment of a joint Japan-U.S. TMD system could saddle Japanese officials with the sober responsibility of making command decisions regarding use of spaceborne weapons for offensive military missions. It is tempting to take comfort in the idea that JDA leaders would not permit a joint missile defense system such as NTW to evolve into a platform for offensive space power, especially since such a development would flout Japanese legal and constitutional prohibitions against such military adventures. However, in a joint command situation,</span> <span class="underline0">it is not clear that</span> <span class="small">such</span> <span class="underline0">constraints would hold up, especially in light of intimidating comments by space power enthusiasts such as Senator Smith, who vows to use his position on Capitol Hill to ram space weaponry down the throats of opponents, regardless of how vocal they are</span><span class="small">: “If the Air Force cannot or will not embrace spacepower, we in Congress will have to drag them there, kicking and screaming if necessary.”62 Another possibility is that Japanese objections against incorporation of offensive space power into a joint missile defense program could be rendered moot by strategic deception. Part II of this essay explored cases where U.S. missile defense advocates deployed subterfuge to camouflage the actual purpose of BMD programs, in order to insulate the program from political criticism. A similar approach would seem politically attractive for public affairs officers dealing with the sensitive issue of a Japanese TMD’s offensive military capabilities. Since such capabilities would clearly prove to be public relations liabilities for missile defense advocates attempting to justify TMD to Asian publics,</span> <span class="underline0">there could be great institutional inertia to pursue a Pentagon-style public relations strategy of hiding such capabilities behind layers of secrecy, classification, and obfuscation</span><span class="small">, then dominating public debate with talk of “purely defensive” BMD systems. However,</span> ba<span class="underline0">ck door deployment of offensive space weapons would pose grave security risks, given the potentially disastrous consequences of an unconstrained arms race in space</span><span class="small">. Lt. Col. Bell provides a glimpse of some of the varieties of space weapons that might be produced in such a scenario: “A mix of space weapons will offer the capability to destroy various types of surface and sub-surface targets with three types of weapons: continuous</span> <span class="underline0">lasers that use heat to melt structures and destroy them; pulsed lasers that vaporize material and penetrate the structure; and kinetic energy weapons that provide the capability to attack targets hundreds of feet under the surface of the earth</span><span class="small">.”63 According to Senator Charles S. Robb (D-VA),</span> <span class="underline0">space weaponization could transform Reagan’s hopeful Star Wars vision into an ominous “death star” future</span><span class="small">. During the Reagan years, advocates of the Strategic Defense Initiative ran an effective television spot featuring children being saved from nuclear attack by a shield represented by a rainbow. If we weaponize space, we will face a very different image—the image of</span> <span class="underline0">hundreds of weapons-laden satellites orbiting directly over our homes and our families 24 hours a day, ready to fire within seconds</span><span class="small">. If fired, they would destroy thousands of ground, air, and space targets within minutes, before there is even a chance of knowing what has happened, or why. This would be a dark future, a future we should avoid at all costs.64 A buildup of space weapons with capability to execute offensive missions might begin with noble intentions of “peace through strength” deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that “…the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use.”65</span> <span class="underline0">Military commanders desiring to harness the precision strike capability afforded by spacebased “smart” weapons might order deliberate attacks on enemy ground targets in a crisis</span>. <span class="underline0">The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense “use or lose” pressure into strategic calculations</span><span class="small">, with the specter of split-second laser attacks</span> <span class="underline0">creating incentives to rig orbiting death stars with automated “hair trigger” devices</span><span class="small">. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However,</span> <span class="underline0">by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict</span><span class="small">. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed “complexly interactive, tightly coupled” industrial systems, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other’s flawless performance. According to Perrow,</span> <span class="underline0">this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail</span><span class="small">. He further explains, “[t]he odd term ‘normal accident’ is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable.”66</span> <span class="underline0">Deployment of space weapons</span> <span class="small">with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles</span> <span class="underline0">would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to “normal accidents.”</span> <span class="small">It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to Bowman, </span><span class="underline0">“even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage—even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!”</span><span class="small">67 In the same laser technology touted by President Reagan as the quintessential tool of peace, David Langford sees one of the most wicked offensive weapons ever conceived: “One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people.”68 Given this unique potential for destruction, </span><span class="underline0">it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to a space weapon attack would escalate by retaliating with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen. </span><br />

Another misperception is that in the long run China will endeavor to drive the U.S. out of East Asia. Again this is not a correct assumption. <u>From Beijing's perspective, the United States is an Asia-Pacific power, although not an Asian power, and its political, economic and security interests in the region are deep-rooted, as are its commitments to regional stability and prosperity. In fact, Beijing has always welcomed a constructive U.S. role in regional affairs.</u> At the same time however, <u>Beijing also feels uneasy with certain aspects of U.S. policy</u>. As a superpower, the United States has been too dominant and intrusive in managing regional affairs. <u>It fails to pay due respect to the voices of other regional players, and sometimes gets too involved in the internal affairs of other states, lacking an understanding of their culture, history and values</u>.

Unilateral security vs. mutual security The United States currently possesses the most powerful military in the world<u>. However, it continues to pump resources into its defense industry to develop even more sophisticated offensive weaponry, thus retaining its paramount superiority in both conventional and strategic arsenals.</u> At the same time, <u>Washington has been pursuing both national missile defense (NMD) and theater missile defense (TMD) systems, aimed at protecting itself from other countries.</u> However, <u>this kind of unilateral security comes at the expense of others' security</u>. <u>The Chinese believe that security is always mutual, and when one side tries to enhance its security, it has to take into account the impact on the security of others</u>. <u>While any country has the legitimate right to develop its defensive and offensive capability as it likes, a responsible power should avoid seeking unilateral security and instead should promote mutual or common security</u>. Absolute security vs. relative security <u>In terms of capability, the United States is now the most secure country in the world.

Some say that while TMD may be useless, it may be a useful tool of diplomatic negotiations. They reason that even though the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), also known as the Star Wars project, was impractical despite its enormous research cost, it was useful to push the Soviet Union into concession in U.S.-Soviet summit talks. By the same token, they say, TMD can also be used to obtain Chinese concessions.73<br />

Japan’s interest in BMD dates to the mid-1980s, when several Japanese companies participated in the Pentagon’s WESTPAC project, a preliminary study of missile defense requirements in the Western Pacific. <u>The Japanese government got directly involved in BMD discussions in 1993, when an official Japan-U.S. TMD Working Group was created “to provide a forum for regular discussion of TMD.”2 Subsequently, U.S. corporations and defense officials lobbied heavily for Japan to endorse the TMD concept and pursue collaborative missile defense projects.</u> Some commentators criticized such back room lobbying because it preempted more robust public discussion regarding the wisdom of TMD for Japan. As one editorial in the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun argued<u>, “[A]mid the absence of government and public arguments, the actual situation is that the defense industry is jumping the gun…”3</u> Toshiyuki Toyoda, a physicist at Meiji Gakun University, expressed <u>similar skepticism with the observation that “people who harbor a blind belief in technology may be easily deceived by the promoters of these expensive scheme</u>s.”4 Such reservations did little to temper American zeal in promoting a Japanese TMD system. <u>At the second meeting of the Japan-U.S. TMD Working Group in 1995, U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) representatives presented Japanese officials with a 40-page document entitled “Japan’s Choices Regarding TMD.” Strongly endorsing several Asian theater missile defense options, the report warned that TMD is “the last military business opportunity for this century.”</u>5 While visiting with a senior Japan Defense Agency (JDA) official, a former U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of Defense said on March 10, 1995 that “relations with the U.S. military, industry, and Congress will suffer if no progress is made in introducing the TMD.”6 <u>After release of the 1995 report, JDA officials questioned the feasibility of TMD and protested the language of BMDO’s presentation on the grounds that it “gives the impression that Japan has already committed itself to the TMD.”7 During the next few years, preliminary discussions continued, with U.S. officials pushing for TMD and Japanese officials largely soft-pedaling such proposals, until a dramatic event profoundly changed the valence of discussions</u>. On August 31, 1998, North Korea launched a prototype Taepodong three-stage missile over the Japanese archipelago. According to Yoichi Funabashi, chief diplomatic correspondent for the Asahi Shimbun, this dramatic test was the “direct impetus” <u>behind Japan’s decision to pursue TMD.8 As The Economist reported, the North Korean launch provided the stimulus needed to break the logjam on Japanese attitudes toward missile defense: “After years of dithering, the Japanese government promptly agreed to participate in America’s proposed Theatre Missile Defense system</u>…”9 There are early indications that the <u>Japan-U.S. TMD project will focus on Research and Development (R&amp;D) options for the Navy Theater Wide (NTW) missile defense system, with project costs running upwards of $524 million, and expenses split evenly by the two parties over five to six years. D</u>esigned to protect against incoming missiles flying within a 1,860-mile radius, NTW is categorized by the U.S. as a theater system, even though it would be designed to have strategic capability for Japan (i.e. to protect the entirety of its geographical land mass).10 <u>In the R&amp;D effort, U.S. officials hope to gain from Japanese contributions in the areas of miniaturization, sensors, propulsion, and cryogenics.11 Also, it is believed that Japan could help with development of the NTW system, by contributing technology and expertise enabling weight reduction of the Navy’s Standard Missile (used as the interceptor component of the new system), as well as refinement of multicolored imagers designed to enhance the ability of NTW sensors to discriminate between actual warheads and decoys.</u> Lighter interceptor missiles could improve NTW’s overall performance by enhancing interceptor range and maneuverability, while more powerful sensor imaging technology might increase the probability that interceptor missiles could locate and home in on target missiles. <u>One way to shed light on the possible course of public argument and scientific collaboration in the Japan-U.S. TMD project is to look to the past. The promotion campaign for this collaborative effort carries the imprints of advocacy schemes deployed to buoy the political fortunes of many missile defense</u> programs since 1983, when U.S. president Ronald Reagan put BMD on the front pages of the world’s newspapers with his famous “Star Wars address.” <u>As historian Frances FitzGerald points out, Reagan’s key motivation for advocating Star Wars was to fashion a rhetorical tool that would allow him to respond to the ominous dangers of the superpower arms race in a way that would appeal to the nuclear freeze constituency</u>. 12 After the speech, missile defense advocates seized upon Reagan’s claim that missile defense could render nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete” <u>by packaging the concept of BMD in the language of peace and disarmament. Remarkably, it appears that marching orders for this rhetorical strategy of co-option were laid out in a “Proposed Plan for Project on BMD and Arms Control” entitled “High Frontier: A New Option in Space</u>,” apparently produced by the Heritage Foundation late into President Reagan’s first term.13 According to former aerospace industry insider Carol Rosin, the objectives of this secret plan are to “get an early BMD underway and develop enough political support to ensure that it could not be turned off,” and to force a drastic reorientation of the U.S. arms control debate in such a way as to “make it politically risky for BMD opponents to invoke alleged ‘arms control arguments’ against an early, or any other BMD system.”14 Specifically, the “High Frontier” document instructs BMD advocates to “unambiguously seek to recapture the term ‘arms control’ and all of the idealistic images and language attached to this term.”15 In a section on “Tactics,” the report recommends a “radical approach that seeks to disarm BMD opponents, either by stealing their language and cause, ‘arms control,’ or by putting them into a tough political corner through their explicit or de facto advocacy of classical anti-population war crimes.” The report continues: “[T]o the extent possible, BMD proponents should begin to stress nuclear disarmament as a new end point, perhaps using such descriptions as arms control through BMD = nuclear disarmament.”16 The report also establishes a rhetorical foundation for strategic deception on the technical aspects of SDI, by suggesting that ethical arguments for BMD should be uncoupled from scientific concerns about technical feasibility; BMD “will be driven by ethical urgency, rather than by technological availability…”17 Examination of the official discourse supporting the Japan-U.S. TMD project reveals areas of overlap in the basic organizing themes <u>for the project and patterns of persuasion pursued in the early U.S. Star Wars promotion campaign. Discussing the joint Japan-U.S. TMD project, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen said, “Our interests are purely defensive.”18 Japan’s Foreign Minister, Masahiko Komura, paralleled this rhetorical tack, by telling the Diet that “the TMD will be purely defensive and will never pose any military threat to other countries.</u>”19 The East Asian Strategic Review, compiled by the National Institute for Defense Studies (<u>a research arm of the JDA) rebutted China’s criticisms of Japan-U.S. TMD collaboration, arguing that such research is “purely defensive.” comments reflect TMD’s strong potential appeal in Japan, where heightened threat perceptions stir calls for pro-active JDA measures, but where political and legal constraints rule out pursuit of deterrence based on a buildup of offensive weaponry. In this</u> climate, TMD seems to be a “delicious” rhetorical option for politicians and military leaders seeking to satisfy hawks and doves simultaneously. <u>Missile defense’s potential appeal cuts across a broad spectrum of military and public opinion. The argument that missile defense can contribute to security through maintenance of technological superiority over adversaries resonates with hawks who endorse peace-through-strength logic, while missile defense’s very name sounds reassuring to some doves who favor defensive military postures and doctrines.</u> <u>Reflecting on the rhetorical potential of Japanese missile defense in this regard, one commentator notes that since “the missiles do not detonate and are intended for defense, adoption could be more politically palatable in a country that…has explicitly renounced war in its constitution</u>.”21 As an antiweapon weapon, missile defense can be lacquered in a veneer of anti-war rhetoric. The same rhetorical maneuver that President Reagan used to sell Star Wars as a <u>tool of disarmament to the U.S. freeze movement during the 1980s appears to have been appropriated by Japanese BMD advocates seeking to reconcile missile defense with their nation’s peace constitution in the contemporary milieu.</u><br />

Some Hibakusha also expressed concern that the test could refuel debate on Japan's nuclearization and more hawkish defense policy.[42] Moreover, several disarmament advocate groups in Japan questioned Tokyo's perpetual reliance on the extended nuclear deterrence of the United States. <span class="underline">With the global movement toward a world without nuclear weapons led by world leaders including president Obama, Japan still needs to be protected under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. For Japan, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is an essential condition for Tokyo to get rid of the U.S. nuclear umbrella</span>. The extended nuclear deterrence has been perceived as an essential factor for a strong alliance between the two countries. In fact, in the wake of this nuclear weapon test, both countries confirmed that the extended deterrence needs to be reinforced. But once global nuclear disarmament has become more realistic undertaking after the United Stated and Russia have achieved a significant reduction in nuclear arsenals through their bilateral arms control negotiation, extended deterrence issues need to be more seriously discussed among U.S. allies. <span class="boldunderline">Japan is now facing a serious dilemma in deciding between nuclear umbrella and nuclear abolition</span><span class="underline">. Increasing nuclear threats from North Korea force Japan to seriously consider which direction the country should go. At the same time, this could be the opportunity for Japan to conduct more pragmatic debate for nuclear disarmament with its allies and other countries, including China</span>.

<u>When assessing the Japan-U.S. TMD project, citizens interested in government accountability and nuclear safety would do well to put stock in the old aphorism: you can’t judge a book by its cover</u>. If historical trends continue, there is good reason to expect that the official discourse on Japanese TMD will cover up technical failure and disguise politically unpopular missions planned for any joint Japan-U.S. system. <u>There are several negative consequences that could result from such deception. One end result of a politically motivated decision to pursue Japanese TMD, based on doctored scientific data, could be deployment of a deeply flawed missile defense system that is technically bankrupt, yet has an illusory veneer of effectiveness.</u> In addition to the fact that such <u>a fraudulent scheme would sacrifice huge amounts of taxpayer funds at the altar of corporate profit, such a development would present profound security risks of its own</u>. Consider <u>that missile defense advocates point to the possibility of “rogue state blackmail” as an emerging threat justifying rapid pursuit of missile defense.</u> This blackmail scenario envisages major powers embroiled in a diplomatic or military dispute where a socalled state of concern (e.g. North Korea, Iran or Iraq—armed with weapons of mass destruction [WMD]) attempts to exact concessions from wealthy states, by threatening their homelands with long-range rocket attack.45 In such a tragic situation, it is suggested that missile defense would preserve “freedom of movement” to call the state of concern’s bluff<u>. To do this, however, leaders of shielded nations would need to have supreme confidence in their missile defense systems. If such confidence was based on faulty or doctored feasibility data, the stage could be set for a miscalculation of tragic proportions</u>. For example, <u>misplaced faith in a leaky missile defense shield could mistakenly embolden a Japanese president to take diplomatic risks that would recklessly expose thousands (perhaps millions) of civilians to nuclear, chemical, or biological attack</u>.46 Perhaps an even more frightening scenario involves a case where missile defense works—but not for its publicly advertised purpose. <u>The frequent argument that BMD is “purely defensive” belies the fact that much missile defense technology can be used for offensive military missions</u>. <u>Consider that the same missile used as an interceptor in the NTW system, the U.S. Navy Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), can also be outfitted with powerful warheads and used in offensive strikes on land and sea targets</u>. “In a strict definition,” explains Yuan Hong of the Chinese Academy of the Social Scientists, “<u>the TMD is a weapon system with both defensive and offensive capabilities</u>.”47 <u>Such insight is reflected in Newsweek International’s observation that “politicians from Seoul to Surabaya view Tokyo’s new defense debate as a smoke screen for rearmament</u>.”48 <u>Any</u> clear-cut <u>distinction between offensive and defense in the TMD context is hopelessly muddied when one realizes that plans for the NTW system include a substantial space component</u>. An elaborate network of space satellites (as well as spaceborne forces to protect them) would be essential features of any robust NTW system, providing early warning data of enemy missile launches, as well as tracking information designed to guide SM-3 interceptors to their targets in mid-flight. It is instructive to note that politically powerful missile defense proponents such as U.S. Senator Bob “Spaceman” Smith (R-NH) envision NTW integrated into an overall space force that would pursue both defensive and offensive military missions.49 We need to incorporate forward-deployed capabilities like the Navy Theater Wide program and the Air Force Airborne Laser as space-based missile defense programs to ensure [that] we can stop missiles in their boost phase, dropping the debris fallout over our adversary’s homes, not ours…[<u>S]pace offers us…the prospect of inflicting violence—all with great precision and nearly instantaneously, and often more cheaply.</u> With credible offensive and defensive space control, we will deter our adversaries, reassure our allies, and guard our nation’s growing reliance on global commerce.50 <u>This full-throated call for a robust blend of offensive and defensive space weaponry reflects a strategic principle elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, “anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand</u>.”51 The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent “dual capability” of spaceborne weapon components. To <u>the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting “death stars,” capable of sending munitions hurtling through the earth’s atmosphere</u> <u>at dizzying velocities</u>.52 As Marc Vidricaire, a member of the Canadian Delegation to the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, explains: “<u>If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land.”</u>53 Furthermore, spaceborne BMD components can be used for offensive attacks in outer space itself, where orbiting space assets belonging to adversaries could be targeted for destruction. According to defense analyst James E. Oberg, “…<u>the benign, defensive nature of a ballistic missile killer is not the only facet of such a system—it also has inherent offensive capability against satellites</u>.”54 <u>This dual capability of BMD systems provides one rationale for why space weapons advocates such as Senator Smith propose to make offensive attack weapons part of missile defense</u>. In a world where deployment of purely offensive space weaponry might be difficult to justify as a stand-alone military initiative, Oberg speculates, “the means by which the placement of space-based weapons will likely occur is under a second U.S. space policy directive—that of ballistic missile defense.”55 Although these “death star” scenarios might seem like they come straight out of Hollywood special effects studios, it is worth noting that the U.S. Space Command is on record endorsing military strategy that favors weaponization of space as a force multiplier for offensive attack missions. An official planning document entitled “Vision for 2020” foresees “space-based strike weapons” as part of “global engagement capabilities” designed to enable “application of precision force from, through, and to space.”56 Aggressive pursuit of these “strike weapons” is imperative, according to Space Command officials, because “space superiority is emerging as an essential element of battlefield success and future warfare.”57 Arguing that “it is inevitable that mankind will weaponize space,” Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas D. Bell claims in a 1999 paper that, “<u>The U.S. ability to conduct combat operations in this environment will provide the technical asymmetry that the U.S. will need to win the next war, just as it used strategic bombers and the atomic bomb to win World War II and stealth technology and precision guided munitions to win the Gulf War</u>.”58 These plans recently received concrete expression in comments from Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, Air Force Space Command Commander. While addressing a group at the Joint Tactical Ground Station in South Korea, Eberhart declared that “[s]pace is the ultimate high ground…Not only do we have to use it, we have to be able to defend it and deny our enemy the use of space if we are at war…we have to ensure space superiority for our commanders and men and women who rely on it during the fight.”5<br />

Evangelista’s analysis of the influence exerted by transnational peace movement activists in the U.S. and Russia during the late 1980s provides one concrete illustration of how energetic dissent can loosen the grip of the Cold War language game. Using what Olson and Goodnight call “discursive oppositional arguments,” <u>American and Soviet anti-nuclear movements linked up to create, in Rita Felski’s terminology, a “counter-public sphere” that rejected the self-reinforcing logic of what Herbert York calls an “internal arms race.</u>”78 Bernd W. Kubbig, of the Peace Research Institute at Frankfurt, Germany, notes that scientists and scholars critical of the arms race “<u>functioned as icebreakers during the Cold War,” working as an “epistemic community” with “an authoritative claim to policy-relevant knowledge</u>.”79 According to Evangelista, the successful efforts of transnational movement allies to shift the terms of public debate through “strategic use of norms, ideas, and information,” created conditions where the superpowers were coaxed to step back from the abyss of nuclear annihilation.80 <u>A similar opportunity presents itself today, with the Japan-U.S. TMD research project still in an embryonic stage. Recent official discourse on this project largely reflects Cold War themes and norms of argumentation. In Japan, Funabashi notes that so far, “government responses to questions on TMD” have been “provided at only a cursory level,” and that the TMD issue “is something that has been discussed only within an extremely small circle of security professionals— the so-called security high priests.</u>”81 However, <u>peace movement advocates in Japan and the U.S. could use the TMD issue to galvanize transnational counter-public spheres, opening up spaces for perennially excluded and co-opted voices to gain traction in public debates on security policy.</u> In such spaces, citizens from both nations could draw upon each other’s experience to shape the tenor and substance of public discourse. In this regard, <u>Americans sorting through the missile defense issue have much to learn from Japanese nuclear abolition advocates, whose passionate opposition to nuclear weaponry is informed by the direct experience of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. According to Joseph Gerson, of the American Friends Service Committee, the “spirit and commitment” of the Japanese hibakusha (nuclear war survivors) are inspiring examples of the “will and steadfastness necessary to force governments to disarm and to return the nuclear genie back to its bottle</u>.”82 As the only nation to have ever been subjected to nuclear attack, <u>Japan brings an important perspective to discussions of international security in a world bristling with weapons of mass destruction</u>. <u>Such perspective can help refocus missile defense debates in constructive ways on both sides of the Pacifi</u>c. For example, as the recent report of the Tokyo Forum for Nuclear Non-Proliferation recommends, <u>whatever the outcome of pending missile defense deployment decisions, nuclear disarmament should be the top priority in security policy: “Missile defenses should not be seen as an alternative to the norm of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament</u>.” 83 The report further suggests that it is especially important to maintain this emphasis on disarmament even in the event of affirmative BMD deployment decisions, through establishment of clear exit strategies that codify conditions under which missile defenses would be removed: “<u>Nations would be wise to leave open the possibility that defensive deployments could be scaled back, or even eliminated, if the sources of concern were reduced or removed</u>.”84 <u>In the other direction, Japanese citizens pondering the wisdom of spending billions of yen on American missile defense technology might reach more informed decisions by learning from the experience of American citizens, who have witnessed their government’s numerous</u> (and largely futile) attempts to engineer an <u>effective missile shield</u> since 1944, when the U.S. Army initiated Project Thumper, the nation’s first BMD program. The <u>history of U.S. missile defense is a trail littered with false promises, dashed expectations, and fraudulent science. Americans could do a service to their Japanese counterparts by sharing the details of this history, thereby putting missile defense advocates’ shopworn claim that effective defense is “just around the corner” in proper perspective</u>. To the extent that <u>reciprocal dialogue of this sort carves out deliberative spaces for citizens to participate more critically in public debates over missile defense, it has potential to challenge the hegemonic status of technocratic thinking as the basis of security polic</u>y. As security studies scholar Simon Dalby explains, the Cold War produced security discourses that “act to reduce the role of political discussion by recasting political issues in terms of technical problems.” <u>Such discourses “depoliticize issues by involving technical expertise in the place of political decision-making.”85 Today’s arguments for missile defense reflect this Cold War pattern of reasoning, with advocates prescribing the technical solution of defensive weapons as an elixir for the political problem of WMD proliferation</u>. In this context, <u>can dialogue and diplomacy really compete with the rhetorically delicious appeal of the missile defense tech-fix?</u> <u>The answer to this question hinges in large part on the efforts of scientists, scholars, and citizens to develop concrete security frameworks that provide credible alternatives to the technocratic model.</u> One promising initiative in this regard is the “Diplomacy First!” proposal recently announced by the Union of German Scientists (VDW). <u>This proposal is remarkable for the way it indicts American calls for NMD and TMD by developing detailed alternatives for dealing politically with the problem of WMD proliferation. Such alternatives are founded on a “policy of prevention” that seeks to control the spread of arms through means of “institutionalized dialogue.</u>”86 Kubbig’s Modernized, Mutually Minimizing Missile Threat Concept (“Quadruple M-TC”) represents one concrete expression of this strategy for achieving post-Cold War security through diplomacy, rather than technological dominance. <u>Kubbig’s security blueprint may be of particular interest to Japanese officials and citizens, since it draws from recent successes in the North Korean case to illustrate the effectiveness of a “Diplomacy First!” approa</u>ch<u>. Contemporary missile defense discussions are freighted with weighty subtexts that often fail to surface in technically oriented debates conducted in official spheres of deliberation</u>. One such subtext can be cast as a question of governance.87 <u>Should hard choices on nuclear weapons policy be left to the security “high priests,”88 who generally make decisions based on secret data churned through recycled Cold War models? If not, is the vision of a post-Cold War democracy dividend on security policy a workable alternative worth pursuing? These questions signal that missile defense deployment decisions not only present important choices regarding military strategy; as moments of collective judgment, they can also be seen as virtual referenda on the relative merits of technocratic versus democratic forms of governance.</u><br />

<u>It is not easy to predict Japan’s future path. The outlines of Japan’s security policy—the realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan, BMD, space development, and the demands of the business sector—were all established</u> during the Bush-Koizumi era. <u>The Obama and Hatoyama administrations might uphold this new status quo, or they might set off in very different directions.</u> The Hatoyama government is, for now, buying time before making any major decisions on basic security policy. Under the previous government of Aso Taro, a report by an advisory panel to the prime minister on Japan’s future security was presented in June 2008. <u>The key thrust of this panel was to change constitutional interpretation in order to allow the exercise of the right to collective self-defense.</u> This report was essentially the supreme expression of the “defense reform” built by the Bush and Koizumi regimes. According to this plan, revision of the National Defense Program Guidelines and the Mid-Term Defense Program were also planned for the end of 2009. However, Prime Minister Hatoyama decided to postpone revision of defense policy by one year. He has also announced the establishment of a new panel of experts. Currently, the United States spends 42 percent of the $1.46 trillion dollars of annual global military expenditures, and East Asia is responsible for 13 percent. Furthermore, <u>military expenditure in East Asia is increasing at a speed, which is pronounced even on an international scale. East Asia, home to an enormous U.S. military presence, is becoming the world’s largest weapons market. <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Japan has considerable latent potential to contribute to the freezing and reduction of regional, and global, military expenditures</span></strong>.</u> Although Japan’s military expenditures remain quite high by global standards, <u>Japan could set <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">an important example for other countries</span> by not increasing this amount and remaining within a standard of less than 1 percent of the GDP.</u> <u>The key issue is whether Japan will continue to develop high-tech military technology relating to BMD or not.</u> The Japanese government and the Japanese public must answer a set of questions connected to these systems. Do they really function? What exactly is this system trying to protect, and from what? Is Japanese industry and technology just being mobilized in order to assume the place of U.S. defense? Is there a calm, efficient, and alternative method to removing the missile threat other than developing intercepting missiles? <strong>Toward Innovative Disarmament Cooperation</strong> <u>Japanese and U.S. development of missile defense and related technology is clearly stimulating a backlash from China. This</u>, in turn, <u>helps China justify the modernization of its nuclear missile forces, leading to the promotion <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">of a regional arms race and a worsening of the regional security environment.</span></strong> It is possible</u>, through coordinated regional diplomacy and strengthened transparency and verification measures, <u>to remove the nuclear and missile threats in a cooperative manner. Such an approach would increase confidence within the region, improve the security environment, ensure that regional resources are not being wastefully invested in military purposes, and bring us closer to building a sustainable peace in East Asia.</u> To the extent that the realignment of U.S. forces reinforces U.S. regional and global power projection capabilities—<u>rather than functioning as a cost-saving mechanism or as a means to enhance collective security—the backlash in Northeast Asia will be strengthened.</u> If North Korea were to view the realignment of U.S. bases in Japan and South Korea as a threat, it will be less likely to follow through on denuclearization. If the relocation of U.S. bases leads to the construction of new bases within Japan or elsewhere, and increases expenses to that end, a key opportunity will have been lost. In order to serve the purpose of regional peace, the realignment of U.S. bases must be used to close redundant bases and promote their withdrawal. The new Hatoyama government is re-examining and trying to readjust the alliance with the United States in the name of “equal partnership” while also calling for the creation of an East Asia Community. <u>Japan must not be misunderstood as reviving its early 20th-century ambitions for military hegemony in the region. The military spending issue can be a breakthrough for Japan, a way to show its commitment to peace while contributing to the construction of a new regional order. Japan should initiate</u> negotiations with China and Korea toward a mutually coordinated freeze and <u>reduction in military expenditure. Rather than abandoning its ties with the U.S. military industry, Japan should use the arms-export ban principle to negotiate and establish a regional framework to curb the arms trade and weapons proliferation.</u> In 1967, Prime Minister Sato Eisaku introduced Japan’s Three Non-Nuclear Principles: not possessing, producing, or permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons. The Diet established these principles as national policy through a resolution in 1971. However, despite the “non-introduction” provision, considerable evidence indicates the existence of secret deals between the U.S. and Japanese government to allow the transit and port-calls of nuclear-weapons-equipped vessels, even since 1960. The Hatoyama government has established a commission to look into these secret deals. It is important to legalize these three principles to prevent a reintroduction of nuclear weapons into Japan. Legalizing the Non-Nuclear Principles will also create momentum for a nuclear weapon free zone in Northeast Asia that would, in turn, strengthen the nonproliferation regime in the region. Despite the advocacy of Keidanren, <u>a concentrated investment in high-tech, military-civilian integrated technology would not lead to overall benefits for the Japanese economy. Such investments would have little economic effect</u> for the vast majority of the Japanese labor force working in small or mid-size business. If Japan were to throw away its reputation as a “peaceful nation,” which it has maintained throughout the post-war era, the Japanese economy, so dependent on trade with Asia and the Middle East, would necessarily suffer. Instead of viewing the Self-Defense Forces as a way to boost employment, the Japanese government should establish an independent organization with straightforward humanitarian purposes such as disaster relief. Through exchange and humanitarian activities with and in neighboring countries, such an organization could reduce military expenditures and build regional confidence. <u>The development of innovative cooperation for disarmament is now needed. At this critical juncture in history, only a cooperative-security approach can lead the way to the creation of a new order of peace.</u><br />

<strong>BMD cooperation is expanding, and deployment will be complete in 2011 – despite ineffectiveness it will encourage Chinese hostility and Asian instability</strong><br />
<strong>Toki</strong>, MA in Int’l Policy and Research Associate @ CNS, <strong>9</strong> [Masako, Project Manager and Research Associate at CNS, Missile Defense in Japan, BAS, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/missile-defense-japan" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/missile-defense-japan</a> /<strong>HN</strong>]<br />
<u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Despite its</span> avowed <span style="background-color: yellow;">pacifist security policy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan has cooperated with the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background-color: yellow;">on missile defense since the</span> 19<span style="background-color: yellow;">80</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Some in Japan would like to alter the country's laws further to allow for an even stronger missile defense cooperative with the United States. Naturally, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">China is watching this alliance</span> carefully, warning that it could lead to regional instability and a renewed arms race in East Asia. Japanese <span style="background-color: yellow;">security policy is at a crossroads</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">shifting </span>from a traditional pacifist security policy <span style="background-color: yellow;">to a more assertive</span> security <span style="background-color: yellow;">policy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As part of this shift</span><u>, Tokyo is steadily moving toward the deployment of a more robust missile defense system</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which the Japanese government doesn't think contradicts the country's &quot;exclusively defensive defense&quot; policy anyway. </span><u>And while the debate about U.S. missile defense installations in Eastern Europe remains contentious, in East Asia, political debate about missile defense installations in Japan seems to be fading away</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, U.S.-Japanese security ties were enhanced post-9/11. His friendship with President George W. Bush also augmented the two countries' bond. As such, </span><u>it was under Koizumi that Japan officially decided to deploy missile defense in collaboration with the United States.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In fact, Koizumi made missile defense a cornerstone of the country's security policy. </span><u>He wasn't alone in this thinking; <span style="background-color: yellow;">many</span> Japanese government officials <span style="background-color: yellow;">perceive missile defense as a </span>more realistic <span style="background-color: yellow;">option in responding to</span> regional <span style="background-color: yellow;">threats</span> such as North Korea's nuclear and missile programs</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In addition, Japan's 2004 National Defense Guidelines, for the first time, stated concerns over China's military modernization. </span><u>History of missile defense in Japan U.S.-Japanese cooperation on missile defense dates back to the 1980s</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). At that time, </span><u>Japan's <span style="background-color: yellow;">participation in SDI was</span> merely <span style="background-color: yellow;">symbolic of</span> U.S.-Japanese <span style="background-color: yellow;">security cooperation</span> and <span style="background-color: yellow;">helpful to mitigate economic</span> and trade <span style="background-color: yellow;">disputes</span> with Washington</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This changed in August 1998 when North Korea tested its Taepodong-1 ballistic missile. Even for the Japanese people, who are generally considered pacifists post-World War II, the Taepodong-1 flying over their heads was an alarming wake-up call. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Immediately afterward</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">Tokyo joined</span></u> <u>Washington in cooperative <span style="background-color: yellow;">research and development of</span> a <span style="background-color: yellow;">b</span>allistic <span style="background-color: yellow;">m</span>issile <span style="background-color: yellow;">d</span>efense <span style="background-color: yellow;">system</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> On the basis of seemingly positive results of missile defense tests and the U.S. decision to deploy an initial national missile defense capability in December 2002, t</span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">he</span> Japanese <span style="background-color: yellow;">government determined that b</span>allistic <span style="background-color: yellow;">m</span>issile <span style="background-color: yellow;">d</span>efense <span style="background-color: yellow;">had high technological feasibility</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In addition, the revelation that North Korea had continued its work on nuclear weapons development and Pyongyang's subsequent withdrawal from the NPT in 2003 convinced Tokyo to officially acquire a ballistic missile defense capability. </span><u>Thus, on December 19, 2003, it issued the cabinet decision &quot;On Introduction of Ballistic Missile Defense System and Other Measure.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; Ever since<span style="background-color: yellow;">,</span> </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">establishing a </span>robust <span style="background-color: yellow;">missile</span> defense <span style="background-color: yellow;">system has been a top</span> national <span style="background-color: yellow;">security priority</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> To implement its new agenda, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Tokyo altered its Na</span>tional <span style="background-color: yellow;">D</span>efense <span style="background-color: yellow;">P</span>rogram <span style="background-color: yellow;">Guidelines</span> in 2005 <span style="background-color: yellow;">to indicate that the</span> country's <span style="background-color: yellow;">Three Principles on Arms Export</span> and related provisions <span style="background-color: yellow;">could be modified</span> as necessary <span style="background-color: yellow;">for the deployment of b</span>allistic <span style="background-color: yellow;">m</span>issile <span style="background-color: yellow;">d</span>efense</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The &quot;Three Principles,&quot; a hallmark of Japan's pacifism policy, </span><u>long barred Tokyo from jointly developing and producing weapons or transferring weapon parts to foreign countries, including the United States</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Tokyo's surprisingly <span style="background-color: yellow;">determined and quick adoption</span> of these decisions <span style="background-color: yellow;">in order to be</span> ready <span style="background-color: yellow;">for the actual deployment of b</span>allistic <span style="background-color: yellow;">m</span>issile <span style="background-color: yellow;">d</span>efense seem to be influenced by North Korea's actions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In particular, since North Korea's July 2006 missile launches, which ended its 1999 missile test moratorium, and Pyongyang's October 2006 nuclear test, Tokyo has accelerated its missile defense deployment. </span><u>Japan's current missile defense capabilities As of January, <span style="background-color: yellow;">Tokyo has deployed a multilayered missile defense system that consists of sea-based</span> midcourse missile defense</u> <u>(the <span style="background-color: yellow;">Aegis</span> ballistic missile defense <span style="background-color: yellow;">system)</span>; <span style="background-color: yellow;">and ground-based</span> terminal phase missile defense (Patriot Advanced Capabilities-3, or <span style="background-color: yellow;">PAC-3</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">). </span><u>With the accelerated process, a PAC-3 installment in the Tokyo Metropolitan area has been completed.</u> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">By</span> March <span style="background-color: yellow;">2011, PAC-3 missiles will</span> be <span style="background-color: yellow;">deployed</span> at 16 fire units <span style="background-color: yellow;">around</span> Japan's <span style="background-color: yellow;">major cities</span>.</u> <u>The <span style="background-color: yellow;">Aegis system features</span> a three-stage missile (<span style="background-color: yellow;">SM-3</span>) with a range of 1,000 kilometers designed <span style="background-color: yellow;">to intercept</span> a short- to intermediate-range ballistic missile in outer <span style="background-color: yellow;">space</span>. At its first flight test in December 2007, the SM-3 launched from Kongo, a Japanese Aegis ship, and detected, tracked, and destroyed a mock missile that resembled North Korea's Nodong outside the atmosphere at an altitude of approximately 100 miles</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. With its mission accomplished, </span><u>Kongo was deployed at Japan's Air Self Defense</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Force (MSDF) Sasebo base in Nagasaki on January 4, 2008. </span><u>As the first country other than the United States to succeed in intercepting a mock missile with the Aegis system, Japan might have been overconfident in its technical feasibility</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, at its first test-firing of the PAC-3 interceptor, MSDF successfully shot down a mock ballistic missile at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico last September. This sequence of successful tests might have brought somewhat more optimistic prospects to Japan's defense ministry. </span><u>Therefore, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the failure of a</span> second <span style="background-color: yellow;">Aegis test</span> in November significantly <span style="background-color: yellow;">disappointe</span>d both U.S. and Japanese <span style="background-color: yellow;">missile defense proponents</span>. While officials said the failure won't affect the program's future--The Ministry of Defense <span style="background-color: yellow;">plans to deploy</span> four <span style="background-color: yellow;">Aegis-equipped destroyers by</span> March <span style="background-color: yellow;">2011</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">-</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">-some setbacks will be unavoidable. </span><u>Impediments to missile defense in Japan &quot;Basic Space Law.&quot; Japan's long-standing, self-imposed r<span style="background-color: yellow;">estriction on the military use of space</span> has impeded it from enhancing its missile defense capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, in August 27,</span> <u>a new law, the &quot;Basic Space Law,&quot; entered into force, lifting the ban on Tokyo's use of space for defensive purpose</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s. Thirty years earlier, </span><u>when Japan's Space Agency was established, the Diet unanimously adopted a resolution committing the country only to using space for peaceful purposes, which <span style="background-color: yellow;">has been interpreted</span> as non-military</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Basic Space Law changed that interpretation to nonaggressive, meaning the MSDF now can manufacture, possess, and operate its own satellites to support military operations such as ballistic missile defense. Thus, the MSDF plans to procure reconnaissance satellites, early warning satellites, and tracking and communications satellites--all areas in which Japan had been relying on the United States. (See &quot;Japan Enters New Space Age.&quot;) For instance, it was the U.S. Defense Support Program satellites that detected the North Korean missile launches in July 2006. The Japanese Constitution. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Under</span> the current Japanese government's interpretation of <span style="background-color: yellow;">Article 9</span> of its Constitution, <span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan's participation</span> in collective self-defense <span style="background-color: yellow;">is prohibited</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">as is using missile defense</span> capabilities to defend a third country--even an ally such as the United States</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Therefore, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a strong advocate of changing Article 9, formed the Council on Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security in April 2007 to provide recommendations on the right of collective self-defense. &quot;</span><u>Whether it is appropriate for Japan to use its missile defense to intercept ballistic missiles targeting the United States&quot; was one of four scenarios he tasked the council to answer.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The council was supposed to submit recommendations to the Cabinet by September 2007, but after the devastating defeat of Abe's ruling party in the upper house election in July 2007 and his abrupt resignation two months later, the council's members delayed making their recommendations. </span><u>Abe's successor, Yasuo <span style="background-color: yellow;">Fukuda</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">wasn'</span>t as <span style="background-color: yellow;">enthusiastic about changing the</span> constitutional <span style="background-color: yellow;">interpretation.</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;"> So</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even though the council submitted its recommendations stating that Japan should have the right to exercise collective self-defense last June, nothing has changed. Taro Aso, the country's third prime minister in two years, is more supportive of the right to collective self-defense, which might revitalize debate over the issue. </span><u>Technologically, <span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan</span> currently <span style="background-color: yellow;">doesn't have the capability to shoot down a missile heading toward the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span>tates even if it legally could</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>But <span style="background-color: yellow;">the</span></u> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">two countries are currently developing SM-3 Block II A</span> missiles <span style="background-color: yellow;">that could</span> potentially <span style="background-color: yellow;">intercept i</span>nter<span style="background-color: yellow;">c</span>ontinental <span style="background-color: yellow;">b</span>allistic <span style="background-color: yellow;">m</span>issile<span style="background-color: yellow;">s</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (See &quot;Japan Test Fires Its First Raytheon-Built Standard Missile-3.&quot;) </span><u>As technological capabilities improve to intercept long-range ballistic missiles,</u> <u>the argument that <span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan isn't allowed by its constitution</span>al interpretation <span style="background-color: yellow;">to shoot down a missile</span> heading toward the United States might be perceived as unacceptable</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

The socio-cultural reticence in Japan to any military engagement hasn't made the country's populace fully tolerant of missile defense. </span><u>Nevertheless, the recent threats from North Korea have dimmed opposition.</u> <u>A 2006 public opinion poll conducted by the Cabinet Office indicated that 56.6 percent of respondents supported missile defense</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; similarly, a Yomiuri-Gallup public opinion poll [in Japanese] conducted in December 2006 showed that 60 percent of respondents supported it. </span><u>For those against it, cost seems to be a primary reason why</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. According to the Ministry of Defense, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the missile defense</span> program <span style="background-color: yellow;">is estimated to cost Japan </span>$7.4 billion to <span style="background-color: yellow;">$8.9 billion</span> through 2012</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And since Tokyo plans to pursue still more advanced technologies, costs are likely to increase</span><u>. China's response Regionally, China has been disturbed by the accelerated progress of the U.S.-Japanese missile defense cooperative. Specifically, China is worried that U.S.-Japanese missile defense could thwart Beijing's limited nuclear deterre</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nt, encourage Japanese militarization, protect Taiwan, and trigger a regional arms race. Chinese opposition to the U.S.-Japan missile defense cooperation isn't as vehement as that of Russia to the U.S. missile defense deployment in Eastern Europe, </span><u>but if <span style="background-color: yellow;">China perceives that the missile shield will shift the balance of power</span> in the region, <span style="background-color: yellow;">its opposition will intensif</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">y</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Future prospects for missile defense in Japan </span><u>The current security environment in East Asia and the Bush administration's interest in missile defense have helped bring the U.S.-Japanese missile defensive cooperative to where it stands today</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That said, President-elect Barack Obama has a different view on missile defense; moreover, he has repeatedly stated that strengthening the nonproliferation regime should be a priority. </span><u>Thus, it's likely that changes in U.S. security priority will alter Japanese missile defense plans somewhat. Nonetheless, Japan's already <span style="background-color: yellow;">scheduled</span> system <span style="background-color: yellow;">deployment</span> date <span style="background-color: yellow;">of 2011</span> probably <span style="background-color: yellow;">will be met</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> More generally, a robust Japanese missile defense capability isn't conducive to sustainable peace in East Asia. </span><u>That's <span style="background-color: yellow;">why it's particularly important that Japan and the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background-color: yellow;">avoid</span> building a structure that <span style="background-color: yellow;">looks</span> confrontational <span style="background-color: yellow;">to China</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which would obviously decrease stability in the region.

<u>Current Chinese Nuclear Policy It can be safely said that of all the nuclear states, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the nuclear policy of China has</span> so far <span style="background-color: yellow;">been the most consistent</span>. From the day China first exploded an atomic bomb, its nuclear policy-related statements have remained unchanged. Five major components can be derived from these statements: No First Use Policy No first use (NFU) has been most frequently and consistently repeated in numerous Chinese government statements ever since China became a nuclear weapon state in 1964</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. By conceding the first use option, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">China has limited itself to retaliatory</span> nuclear <span style="background-color: yellow;">use only</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. China has also called all nuclear weapon states to commit themselves to a NFU policy at any time and in any circumstances. </span><u>Security Assurance to Non Nuclear Weapons States and Nuclear Free Zones China has been very critical of the use of nuclear threats against non-nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapons zones</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">It has repeatedly called on all the nuclear weapon states to agree to a legally-binding, multilateral agreement under which they would pledge not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states and nuclear free zone<u>s.</u></span> <u>This policy component limits China’s potential nuclear adversaries to just the few nuclear weapon states. Apart from the negative security assurance, which China gives unconditionally to all non-nuclear weapon states, <span style="background-color: yellow;">China issued </span>its <span style="background-color: yellow;">first formal</span> positive <span style="background-color: yellow;">security assurance with</span> the other f<span style="background-color: yellow;">our</span> declared <span style="background-color: yellow;">nuclear weapon states</span> in April 1995, <span style="background-color: yellow;">promising to come to the aid of</span> any non-nuclear weapon <span style="background-color: yellow;">state subject to</span> nuclear <span style="background-color: yellow;">attack</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and pursue appropriate punishment against the attacking state, under the auspices of the UN Security Council. This policy has become part of the UN Security Council Resolution 984. Limited Development of Second Strike, Retaliatory Capability </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">China has repeated</span> its <span style="background-color: yellow;">intention to maintain</span> a very <span style="background-color: yellow;">small nuclear arsenal on many occasions</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In its 2003 Defense White Paper, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">China states</span> that <span style="background-color: yellow;">it “has</span> always e<span style="background-color: yellow;">xercised</span> utmost <span style="background-color: yellow;">restraint on</span> the development of nuclear weapons, and <span style="background-color: yellow;">its</span> nuclear <span style="background-color: yellow;">arsena</span>l is kept <span style="background-color: yellow;">at the lowest level</span> necessary <span style="background-color: yellow;">for</span> self-<span style="background-color: yellow;">defense only</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”[1] However, <span style="background-color: yellow;">t</span></span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">o make this</span> small <span style="background-color: yellow;">arsenal</span> a <span style="background-color: yellow;">credible</span> deterrent, China has to make it survivable to a first nuclear strike, even that strike is overwhelming and devastating.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In Chinese literature, “</span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">few but effective</span>” (jinggan youxiao) are the words most frequently <span style="background-color: yellow;">used to describe its necessary arsenal.</span> Opposition to Nuclear Deployment outside National Territories China is opposed to the policy of extended nuclear deterrence, or the policy of providing &quot;nuclear umbrellas&quot; by nuclear weapon states to their allies. In consistence with China’s long standing policy of not sending or stationing any troops outside China, it is also officially opposed to the deployment of nuclear weapons outside national territories,</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">and has stated that China will never deployed nuclear weapons on any foreign soil. Complete Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and Thorough Nuclear Disarmament China first called for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons in its proposal for a world summit in1963, before its first nuclear explosion.</span> <u>On the same day of China’s first nuclear explosion, it again stated that “<span style="background-color: yellow;">the Chinese government</span> hereby solemnly <span style="background-color: yellow;">proposes to</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">governments</span> of the world that a summit conference of all the countries of the world be convened <span style="background-color: yellow;">to discuss the questions of the complete prohibition</span> and thorough destruction <span style="background-color: yellow;">of nuclear weapons</span>, and that as the first step, the summit conference conclude an agreement to the effect that the nuclear powers and those countries which may soon become nuclear powers undertake not to use nuclear weapons either against non-nuclear countries and nuclear-free zones or against each other</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot;[2] This has evolved into China’s basic position on nuclear disarmament and it has never given up its efforts to promote an international convention to ban nuclear weapons. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The above major components of Chinese nuclear policy</span>, if interpreted through the lens of Western deterrence terminology, <span style="background-color: yellow;">can be characterized as: Strategic Rather than Operational</span> and Tactical Deterrence Mao Zedong, in elaborating China's reason to develop nuclear weapons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, said “we will not only have possession of more aircraft and artillery pieces, but also atom bombs. In today’s world, we must have this thing if we don’t want to be bullied by others.”[3] </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The original purpose</span> of nuclear development in China <span style="background-color: yellow;">was to “break up the nuclear threat and smash </span>the <span style="background-color: yellow;">nuclear blackmai</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">l</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (dabuo he weixie, fensui he ezha).” </span><u>As a political instrument, nuclear weapons are to be utilized mainly at the level of grand strategy, not as a winning tool in military operations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The military value of nuclear weapons lies only in its deterrent effect against nuclear attack. The officially declared missions of the Second Artillery Force are twofold: T</span><u>o deter the use of nuclear weapons against China, and To launch an effective nuclear counter-attack in the case of such an attack.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[4] No distinction has been made in categorizing nuclear operations. A nuclear strike against China—whether conducted at strategic, operational or tactical level, with high or low yield warheads, or deadly or tolerable lethality—is perceived as the utmost form of warfare in Chinese war categorization, which must be responded strategically. In Chinese strategic literature, we only see the discussion on how to deter a nuclear war from happening, on how to prevent a conventional conflict from escalating into a nuclear war, and how to retaliate after suffering a nuclear attack—but never how to win a nuclear war. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The primary Chinese perception is that nuclear wars are not to be won, but to be prevented</span>. Retaliatory—Rather than Denial—Deterrence</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[5] Many Chinese cite Deng Xiaoping when explaining China's nuclear thinking. He explained, in a meeting with foreigners in 1983: &quot;</span><u>While you have some deterrence force, we also have some; but we don't want much. It will do just to possess it. Things like strategic weapons and deterrence forces are there to scare others. They must not be used first. But our possession will have some effect. The limited possession of nuclear weapons itself exert some pressure. It remains our position that we will develop a little (nuclear weapons). But the development will be limited</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">We have said repeatedly that our small amount (of nuclear weapons) is nothing. It is only to show that we also have what you have. If you want to destroy us, you yourself have to suffer some punishment at the same time.&quot;[6] Deng’s statement echoed Mao’s nuclear thinking in several aspects: Nuclear weapons are desirable only for its deterrent value, not for battlefield utility. Nuclear weapons, if ever used, will be used to cause the enemy as much pain as possible, so as to enhance its deterrent value in the first place. Therefore, China has to adopt counter-value as opposed to counterforce targeting strategies, in order to strengthen its deterrence posture. Only a small number of nuclear weapons will satisfy China’s deterrent needs—to convince potential nuclear adversary of a possible nuclear retaliation. Both Mao and Deng are very explicit that the deterrent effectiveness does not increase in proportion with numbers of nuclear weapons. A survivable and invulnerable small arsenal can be equally effective in terms of deterrence. Deterrence effect depends on invulnerability to nuclear strikes, not on large amount of nuclear attack capabilities. Accordingly, what China has been seeking is a nuclear arsenal that is small in size but good in quality.</span> <u>As confined by its adherence to NFU policy, <span style="background-color: yellow;">China has to focus its nuclear development efforts on “second strike capabilities</span>” which must be credible and survivable in order <span style="background-color: yellow;">to have deterrent effect</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Central Rather than Extended Deterrence[7] By declaring to counter-attack with nuclear weapons only after being attacked by nuclear weapons, China has preserved nuclear capabilities to protect its own most vital interests—that is, the existence of the nation. Even during the Cold War years, China has never provided nuclear umbrella to any other country in the world. </span><u>For China, the concept of extended deterrence has simply not entered into it nuclear calculus—yet. General Rather than Immediate Deterrence The mutual deterrence exercised by the two nuclear superpowers during the Cold War had been directed at one another.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> They were both 69the ones to deter, and the ones to be deterred. They </span><u>formed a bilateral deterrent relationship, in which each side was very clear whom it wanted to deter, and what it wanted to deter them from. Their deterrence was more of an immediate nature.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">China had never comfortably fitted into the bipolar context. It had been in one of the poles for some time, then outside of both poles for some time, and then it tried to be closer to the other pole. In addition, China had not had the luxury of a nuclear umbrella for most of the Cold War years. </span><u>Therefore, <span style="background-color: yellow;">China’s nuclear deterrence had been more of a general nature</span>—in which China tried to form a multilateral deterrent relationship with all the nuclear powers, which only made clear what China wanted to deter.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Defensive </span><u>Rather than Offensive Deterrence One famous tenet laid down by Chairman Mao Zedong is the Sixteen Character Guideline for the use of force—“We will never attack unless we are attacked; and if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” (ren bu fan wo, wo bu fan ren; ren ruo fan wo, wo bi fan ren). Behind this guideline is a sober headed analysis of power balances. The PLA and its predecessors entered and won most wars as an inferior side against great odds. So a defensive posture had always been preferred to an offensive one. However, Chinese forces have managed to turn from being the weaker into the stronger party in the course—usually a protracted course—of previous conventional wars. </span><u>When applied to nuclear policy, <span style="background-color: yellow;">this Guideline simply means a rejection of preemptive thinking</span>. The renunciation of the first-use option, the willingness to accept vulnerability, the confinement to retaliatory nuclear use, the principle of attacking only after being attacked</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (hou fa zi ren), the focus on second strike capabilities, and the reservation of nuclear means as the last resort to protect only the most vital national interests, all point to the defensiveness of China’s nuclear policy. </span><u>Although nuclear weapons are inherently offensive weapons, when deterrence strategies are applied in the way China does, they acquire a pure defensive posture</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Minimum Rather than Limited or Maximum Deterrence If I am to choose from Western deterrence classifications to describe Chinese nuclear deterrence posture in general, I would have to use the handy concept of “minimum deterrence” as compared to maximum or limited deterrence. Personally, I think the word “minimum” has too strong a quantitative connotation that is misleading. It sometimes suggests a quantitative standard instead of a qualitative standard. The word “minimum” has for some time been officially used in Chinese government documents.[8]</span> <u>But what I want to emphasize is that <span style="background-color: yellow;">Chinese strategists take the concept as a relative one,</span> defined not only by pure numbers, but more importantly by such key criteria as invulnerability of nuclear forces, assurance of retaliation, and credibility of counter-attack.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">When a Chinese document says that China intends to possess nuclear weapons only at the minimum (or lowest) level for the needs of self-defense, that means to have the minimum but assured capabilities for a retaliatory second strike. Some studies have suggested a shift of Chinese nuclear posture toward limited deterrence, where China could employ nuclear weapons to deter both conventional and nuclear wars, and even to exercise escalation control in the event of a conventional confrontation.[9]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Ho</span><u>wever, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the basic logic of China’s nuclear thinking dictates nuclear weapons as deterring—not as a means of winning</span> against nuclear weapons.</u><br />

<strong>2 Internal Links for Modernization</strong><br />

<strong>Upper tier BMD is perceived as Taiwan-Japan alliance- causes quick modernization</strong><br />

Hughes, Principal Research Fellow &amp; Acting Co-Director at the Centre for the Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation at the University of Warwick, December 2006, “Ballistic Missile Defence and US-Japan and US-UK Alliances Compared”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:7894:http://www.garnet-eu.org/fileadmin/documents/working_papers/1106.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.garnet-eu.org/fileadmin/documents/working_papers/1106.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.garnet-eu.org/fileadmin/documents/working_papers/1106.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:7894 -->]<br />
<u>Japan’s existing security dilemma</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> vis-à-vis North Korea is well known. Japan’s participation in BMD, although not likely to stimulate the North’s already on-going missile programme which is so vital to its diplomatic and military campaign to break out of its international isolation, is also unlikely to curb the North’s build-up of its missile forces, and this is despite opinions which see BMD as a means to convince the North of the futility of threatening Japan and the US. Instead, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the</span> principal <span style="background-color: yellow;">security dilemma that BMD is likely to exacerbate</span> for Japan <span style="background-color: yellow;">is that visàvis China. Chinese policy-makers are concerned that</span> Japan’s <span style="background-color: yellow;">development of</span> a <span style="background-color: yellow;">BMD</span> 25 system developed in conjunction <span style="background-color: yellow;">with the US could lead to the negation of its nuclear deterrent</span> by providing Japan with both a ‘spear’ and ‘shield’</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The spear of the US extended nuclear deterrent would be complemented by a BMD shield, allowing Japan deterrence by both punishment and denial vis-à-vis China. Chinese </span><u>fears might <span style="background-color: yellow;">in part be justified as the Aegis BMD system may have</span> some residual or ‘break out’ <span style="background-color: yellow;">capabilities to defend</span> against its inter-continental ballistic missiles (<span style="background-color: yellow;">ICBMS</span>), and certainly <span style="background-color: yellow;">the US regards the Aegi</span>s/SMD component of its <span style="background-color: yellow;">missile defence as part of a</span> defensive <span style="background-color: yellow;">shield against ICBMs</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.25 </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">China</span> in all likelihood though <span style="background-color: yellow;">could overcome the negation of its </span>strategic nuclear <span style="background-color: yellow;">arsenal through the employment of countermeasures a</span>nd development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV) <span style="background-color: yellow;">to overwhelm any BMD system</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. China’s concerns extend also to the </span><u>Japan’s possible countering of its tactical ballistic missiles and involvement in the Taiwan issue</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. China’s </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">worst case scenario would be</span> Japan’s d<span style="background-color: yellow;">eployment</span> either individually or <span style="background-color: yellow;">in conjunction with the US of its sea-mobile</span> NTWD <span style="background-color: yellow;">system to defend Taiwan</span> in a future crisis situation. In particular, China would fear the formation of a quasi-alliance amongst the US, Japan and Taiwan. For if the US were to sell AWS and BMD technology to Taiwan, this could result in all three powers being equipped with fully interoperable equipment, so smoothing the way for three-way military cooperation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Japan’s reluctance to become embroiled directly in a Taiwan Straits crisis makes this an unlikely scenario except in circumstances of a full scale conflict. </span><u>Far more likely is that Japan would utilise its BMD system to defend US forces operating in a Taiwan Straits crisis from bases in Japan; an action that would complicate any attempts by China to intimidate US forces in the region short of initiating a war also against Japan. China can ultimately overcome any BMD system through increasing production of its missiles; a process that is relatively cheap and likely to saturate and overcome any defence. Therefore, <span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan’s interest in BMD,</span> although not initiating the process, <span style="background-color: yellow;">carries the risk of accelerating China’s upgrading</span> of <span style="background-color: yellow;">its nuclear and</span> conventional ballistic <span style="background-color: yellow;">missile capabilities</span> and generating further momentum for a regional arms race</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

Ultimately, the Chinese leadership would like to regain control of what it considers to be a renegade province. For 20 THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE </span><u>China, unification with Taiwan is a cherished national goal. In the past <span style="background-color: yellow;">China’s leaders have threatened the use of force if Taiwan</span> formally <span style="background-color: yellow;">declared independence</span>, a Chinese government white paper released in February 2000 broadened the reasons that Beijing considered would justify the use of military force—specifically</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, “if Taiwan’s authorities refused indefinitely ‘the peaceful settlement of cross-Straits reunification through negotiations.’ ”56 </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Believing that a US-Japan TMD</span> system <span style="background-color: yellow;">will also be clearly designed to counter China’s ballistic missiles</span>, then it would eliminate Beijing’s only credible military option to bring Taipei to the negotiating table on China’s terms. Reinforcing this belief is the joint <span style="background-color: yellow;">US-Japanese decision to pursue</span></u> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">R&amp;D on an upper</span>-<span style="background-color: yellow;">tier</span>, NTW<span style="background-color: yellow;">-like TMD system</span>. Such a ship-based system would have wide-area defensive coverage and be highly mobile; it could therefore <span style="background-color: yellow;">be moved </span>quickly <span style="background-color: yellow;">to thwart Chinese actions against Taiwan</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Chinese argue that, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">even if there is no US or Japanese intent</span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> at the present time to use a missile defense system <span style="background-color: yellow;">to protect Taiwan in the event of a cross-strait crisis</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">a shipbased TMD system will</span> clearly <span style="background-color: yellow;">provide</span> the United States and Japan such a <span style="background-color: yellow;">capabilit</span>y which they may then choose to use</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span><u>based on extensive interviews conducted in 1996 and 1998 with military and civilian analysts in Chinese government think tanks and academicians at leading Chinese institutions, Christensen concludes that Chinese officials view the Japanese as more likely than the United States to oppose Taiwan’s reintegration with the mainland. Christensen supports his conclusion with the following: Taiwan is a former Japanese colony (1895–1945). It is near international sea-lanes that are important to Japan.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In addition, . . . </span><u>Japan has a strategic interest in preventing Taiwan’s high-technology and capital-rich economy from linking politically with the mainland</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, </span><u>some Chinese analysts view Taiwan as having geostrategic significance for Japan as a potential ally because of its location near the Chinese mainland</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.57 </span><u>Perhaps of even greater concern to Beijing than <span style="background-color: yellow;">the use of missile defenses</span> by the United States or Japan in a possible future China-Taiwan contingency is that defensive weapons, <span style="background-color: yellow;">such as a TMD</span> system, <span style="background-color: yellow;">deployed by Taiwan’s allies</span> and friends may bolster Taiwanese leadership’s confiKIZIAH 21 dence <span style="background-color: yellow;">to declare permanent independence</span> from China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.58 </span><u>Preventing Taiwan from legitimizing the current territorial status quo, that is, de facto independence, is a high-priority Chinese security goal as evidenced by their ever increasing coastal ballistic missile deployments near Taiwan and their frequent veiled threats indicating a willingness to risk war to prevent others from intervening in their internal affairs.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And </span><u>Beijing’s concerns and rhetoric do not appear to be diminished by the US’s “three no’s” policy that includes no support for Taiwan’s independence</u><br />

<strong>A war with Taiwan draws in major powers- only scenario for war with China</strong><br />
<strong>Hunkovic 8</strong> [American Military University “The Chinese-Taiwanese Conflict Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan and the United States of America”<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Actors and Perceptions: </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">A war between China, Taiwan and the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background-color: yellow;">has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world w</span>ar, therefore, many countries <span style="background-color: yellow;">other than the primary actors</span> could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, <span style="background-color: yellow;">if they were drawn in</span>to the war, <span style="background-color: yellow;">as well as</span> all <span style="background-color: yellow;">other countries in the world that participate in the</span> global <span style="background-color: yellow;">economy, in which the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background-color: yellow;">and China are the two most dominant members</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. </span><u>However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study. China: China is undoubtedly the country in this conflict that has the most influence over how it will eventually unfold, particularly, whether or not it turns into a military conflict</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While China’s apparent obsession with such a small country for the simple reason that they use to be part of Chinese territory nearly sixty years ago might seem irrational to an observer with a superficial understanding of the situation, the loss of Taiwan could have dangerous political and national security concerns for the country. The Taiwan issue has become a crucial issue of territorial integrity to Beijing, as well as a symbol of the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party; <span style="background-color: yellow;">if </span></span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Taiwan</span> successfully <span style="background-color: yellow;">gains its independence</span>, other renegade provinces may attempt to break free as well and the government in <span style="background-color: yellow;">Beijing may be viewed as weak</span> by its own people, <span style="background-color: yellow;">which could incite revolts</span> and civil unrest.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Chinese government’s worst fears are that the loss of Taiwan could begin a downward spiral for China, leading to the loss of territory, party power and </span><u>China’s military superiority in the region. Political: Despite the push towards state-sponsored capitalism and the loosening of some restrictions on trade and travel for Chinese citizens, the Chinese Communist Party still rules its country in an autocratic, authoritarian fashion.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, breakaway provinces, challenges to the government and civil unrest have been dealt with quickly and forcefully, with occasionally infamous results, such as the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989. Definite resentment exists between some members of the Chinese populace who favor democracy and the dictatorial Chinese government, as well as between Beijing and renegade provinces, such as Tibet and the largely Muslim Xinhua province. The Chinese Communist Party has been struggling in recent years to balance its very successful move towards capitalism and modernization with maintaining its Marxist ideals, with Westernizing itself enough to attract international investment and trade without giving its citizens enough freedoms to be able to question and challenge the party’s power and legitimacy. China’s economic future depends on further international investment and being able to present itself as a modernized mainstream state to the world, while maintaining its power over renegade provinces and factions within its borders. This dilemma has caused a degree of infighting within CCP ranks and caused the party to resort to patriotism as a point of agreement. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Taiwan has become the focal issue of the CCP,</span> as they view being able to <span style="background-color: yellow;">reacquire Taiwan as a move that would strengthen party unity, end a historical humiliation</span>,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> cause renegade elements within China to abandon their challenges to party legitimacy and allow China to reach its greatest point in history. Economic: Contrary to political and national security concerns, China’s booming economy and lucrative trade and international investment in its country are very strong incentives to avoid any military action towards Taiwan. If China were to attack Taiwan, trade and investment from the United States, who are business partners, but military rivals with the PRC, could come to an end, which would significantly damage the Chinese economy. </span><u>If the world were to see Chinese military aggression towards Taiwan as the gross brutalization of a smaller country by a much larger and more powerful one, akin to the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, China could quickly not only find other countries ceasing trade with and investment in Chinese companies, but find them reinvesting their capital with Japan instead, permanently stopping China’s meteoric economic rise. Additionally, despite their rivalry, <span style="background-color: yellow;">Taiwan is a very valuable trading partner</span> with China and each country has tens of billions of dollars invested in each others’ economies, <span style="background-color: yellow;">which would only serve to worsen the economic impact</span> if a Cross-Strait war were to break out.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Given the currently dire world economic situation, an unprovoked attack of Taiwan could not only cost China its position as one of the economic titans of the world, but cause depression within the PRC, giving the CCP an entirely new set of problems to address. </span><u>Therefore, from this perspective, <span style="background-color: yellow;">China has a vested interest in</span> either <span style="background-color: yellow;">maintaining the status quo</span> with Taiwan, which allows each country to have a working compromise, despite political rhetoric on both sides or being able to place diplomatic pressure on Taiwan to peacefully reunite. The uncertainty of militarily invading Taiwan, especially with the prospect of military intervention on behalf of the United States quite frankly makes an invasion far too risky to contemplate, as the negative impact on the Chinese economy would be certain. Therefore, a war with Taiwan is a losing prospect for China and would be wise to avoid unless determined to be absolutely necessary. National Security: <span style="background-color: yellow;">Despite its small size, Taiwan holds much strategic value to the PRC.</span> If it were to establish full independence, Taiwan would be free to not only challenge to power of China and gain UN membership, but would also be free to establish much close military ties with the United States,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> which would quite possibly include an American military presence in Taiwan, eighty miles from the coast of China. This presence could also include strategic weaponry, including a nuclear arsenal capable of hitting anywhere within the PRC and would effectively end any ambitions of China expanding its territory into the Pacific or Southeast Asia. </span><u>Such a scenario would have grim national security implications for the PRC. <span style="background-color: yellow;">China’s</span> national <span style="background-color: yellow;">security issues could</span> possibly <span style="background-color: yellow;">go beyond the loss of Taiwan and</span> American <span style="background-color: yellow;">military encroac</span>hment, if Taiwan were able to gain full independence.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">After being defeated by a tiny country with a fraction of the military might as the PLA, the PRC could find itself facing a chain reaction of breakaway province trying to secede, including Xinhua and possibly even Tibet. </span><u>Furthermore, while the international standoff with North Korea over its nuclear program has officially ended, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the next leader after</span> the reportedly ailing <span style="background-color: yellow;">Kim Jung</span> Il <span style="background-color: yellow;">could see a weakened China as an opportunity to resume</span> the de<span style="background-color: yellow;">velopment of a nuclear arsenal</span>, which would leave China in a precarious national security situation if relations with North Korea were to deteriorate in the future</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In other words, the national security concerns for China regarding Taiwan are potentially grave</span><u>. <span style="background-color: yellow;">If China were to lose Taiwan, at best, its ability to expand into the Pacific would be curtailed</span> and it would most likely find itself encroached upon by the U.S. military and at worst, it could find itself losing other territories, in a similar fashion to the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War and facing a nuclear arsenal or arsenals just beyond its borders, which would effectively end any reign of military supremacy that the PRC currently enjoys.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">If such were to occur, the CCP could easily lose control of their country, given their loss of power and territory and be in no position to make any demands of the United States on any issues, </span><u>including the democratization of China, as the U.S. could gain a first-strike nuclear capability against them. Considering these facts, the People’s Republic of <span style="background-color: yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">China may not be desirous of a war with Taiwan under the current conditions, but absolutely must militarily defend their interests</span> if an attempt at secession occurs, as failing to do so could reduce their formerly powerful nation to a fraction of its former self, as well as incite revolution within the country and a possible overthrow of the CCP.</u><br />

<strong>Nuclear War</strong><br />

China is another matter...a nuclear holocaust.<br />
China is another matter. <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">No sane figure</span> in the Pentagon <span style="background-color: yellow;">wants a war with China</span>, and <span style="background-color: yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">all serious US militarists know that China's</span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">minuscule nuclear capacity is not</span> o<span style="background-color: yellow;">ffensive</span> but a deterrent <span style="background-color: yellow;">against the overwhelming US power</span> arrayed against it</span> (twenty archaic Chinese warheads versus more than 7,000 US warheads). <span style="background-color: yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Taiwan,</span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> whose status constitutes the still incomplete last act of the Chinese civil war, <span style="background-color: yellow;">remains the most dangerous place on earth</span>.</span></u> Much as the 1914 assassination of the Austrian crown prince in Sarajevo led to a war that no one wanted, <span style="background-color: yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">a misstep in Taiwan by any side could bring the Un</span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">ited <span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background-color: yellow;">and China into a conflict that neither wants. Such a war would bankrupt the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span>tates</span>, deeply divide Japan and probably end in a Chinese victory, given that China is the world's most populous country and would be defending itself against a foreign aggressor. <u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">More seriously, <span style="background-color: yellow;">it could easily escalate into a nuclear holocaust</span></span>. Since any Taiwanese attempt to declare its independence formally <span style="background-color: yellow;">would be viewed as a challenge to China's sovereignty</span>, forward-deployed US forces on China's borders have virtually no deterrent effect. The United States uses satellites to observe changes in China's basic military capabilities. But the coastal surveillance flights by our twelve (now eleven) EP-3E Aries II spy planes, like the one that was forced down off Hainan Island, seek information that is useful only in an imminent battle. They are inherently provocative and inappropriate when used to monitor a country with which we are at peace.</u> The United States itself maintains a 200-mile area off its coasts in which it intercepts any aircraft attempting similar reconnaissance. <span style="background-color: yellow;">A<u>merica's provocative</u></span> <u>military <span style="background-color: yellow;">posture in East Asia makes war with China more likely</span> because <span style="background-color: yellow;">it legitimizes military strategies</span> in both Beijing and Taipei as well as in Washington and Tokyo. Although the spy-plane incident may have provoked new caution in a few Taiwanese who fear becoming the battleground in a China-US war, <span style="background-color: yellow;">it also emboldens those who advocate independence</span> from China <span style="background-color: yellow;">to continue fostering Chinese-American conflict</span> as a cover for their own aspirations. Former President Lee Teng-hui's controversial visits to both Japan and the United States may be an attempt to do precisely that.</u><br />

<span class="underline">One major issue</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">that</span> </span><span class="underline">is</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">not being talked about in regard to this new plan is the implications it has for</span> </span><span class="underline">space security</span><span class="small"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Space security has many definitions. In the US, it is commonly defined as protecting space assets and capabilities. In Europe, most would define it as using space capabilities to enable human security on Earth. More broadly, it can also be defined as protecting the long-term sustainability of and access to the space environment for continued socioeconomic benefits. All of these definitions are valid and may be in play at different times for different people. Many people assume that space security inevitably means a ban on space weapons or military activities in space. However, that is not true and there are many different perspectives on this. For example, from the perspective of space sustainability, only those space weapons that adversely affect the space environment, such as kinetic energy interceptors, would be seen as something to control or ban. Many states also recognize the difference between militarization and weaponization of space, and increasingly define peaceful uses as non-aggressive instead of non-military.</span></span> <span class="underline">At the heart of the relationship between BMD and space security is the issue of dual-use technology</span><span class="small"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Broadly defined, these are technologies</span></span> <span class="underline">that have both a legitimate defensive use and potential military weapons application</span><span class="small"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Now, this definition has its issues—many would argue that everything is potentially dual-use, such as a pencil that could be used to both write and stab. But an essential element of arms control and proliferation is the concept that certain technologies are important (and potentially dangerous) enough that they require special controls. This was behind the addition of many space-related items to the United States Munitions List (USML) after two US companies were fined for providing technical help to China on space launch vehicles, which allegedly also benefited their ballistic missile program in the 1990s. The USML contains many technologies and articles that fall under export controls. A current example of this issue of dual use is North Korea’s ballistic missile program. <u>The DPRK maintains the position that its space program is solely for peaceful purposes and is geared towards developing space launch capability, something that many other sovereign States have pursued in the past. However, it is also the case that much of the same technology behind space launch vehicles is also applicable to ICBMs capable of carrying a WMD payload (see “A space launch vehicle by any other name…”, The Space Review, March 9, 2009</u>).</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">The same dual-use argument can be made for</span> several <span style="background-color: yellow;">technologies being used for BMD</span>. The same kinetic-kill i<span style="background-color: yellow;">nterceptors</span> that <span style="background-color: yellow;">can destroy a missile in-flight</span> could also be capable of destroying a satellite</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">in low Earth orbit (</span></span><span class="underline">and in doing so, effectively become</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">anti-satellite weapons, or</span> </span><span class="underline">ASATs</span><span class="small"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">). This was unequivocally demonstrated by the previously mentioned Operation Burnt Frost, which only required minor modifications, reportedly just software, to an existing Aegis SM-3 interceptor to destroy a satellite (USA-193), albeit one that was in the initial stages of atmospheric re-entry.</span></span> <span class="underline">There are limits on the utility of BMD systems as ASATs: the maximum speed of the interceptor limits the maximum altitude at which it can attack satellites</span><span class="small"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. <u>In the case of the SM-3 Block 1A, its maximum velocity is reportedly around 3 km/s. This gives it a maximum ballistic flight range of about 1000 kilometers and a maximum theoretical ASAT altitude of about 500 kilometers, about twice the altitude of 240 kilometers at which it destroyed USA-193.</u></span></span> <span class="underline">However, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the newer Block</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">1B and</span> </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">2A of the SM-3 will have a much greate</span>r burnout <span style="background-color: yellow;">velocity a</span>nd thus increased ASAT engagement altitude, reportedly around 4.5 km/s</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">for Block 2A.</span> </span><span class="underline">This <span style="background-color: yellow;">would allow it to reach satellites</span> throughout</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">low</span> </span><span class="underline">Earth orbit</span><span class="small"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, up to a theoretical altitude of around 2000 kilometers. From this it is clear that</span></span> <span class="underline">as BMD interceptors increase <span style="background-color: yellow;">their maximum velocity to </span>be able to intercept <span style="background-color: yellow;">ICBMs, </span>they also increase <span style="background-color: yellow;">in potential ASAT capability.</span> </span><br />

<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mitchell 1</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> [Gordon R., Member of the Center for Strategic and International Studies Working Group on Theater Missile Defenses in the Asia-Pacific Region., Winter “Japan-U.S. Missile Defense Collaboration: Rhetorically Delicious, Deceptively Dangerous”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Egordonm/JPubs/JapanTMD.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/JPubs/JapanTMD.pdf</a>] </span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Any clear-cut distinction between offensive and defense in the TMD context is hopelessly muddied when one realizes that plans for the NTW system include a substantial space component. An elaborate network of space satellites (as well as spaceborne forces to protect them)</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">would be essential features of any robust NTW system, providing early warning data of enemy missile launches, as well as tracking information designed to guide SM-3 interceptors to their targets in mid-flight</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. It is instructive to note that politically powerful missile defense proponents such as U.S. Senator Bob “Spaceman” Smith (R-NH) envision NTW integrated into an overall space force that would pursue both defensive and offensive military missions.49 We need to incorporate forward-deployed capabilities like the Navy Theater Wide program and the Air Force Airborne Laser as space-based missile defense programs to ensure [that] we can stop missiles in their boost phase, dropping the debris fallout over our adversary’s homes, not ours…[S]pace offers us…the prospect of inflicting violence—all with great precision and nearly instantaneously, and often more cheaply. With credible offensive and defensive space control, we will deter our adversaries, reassure our allies, and guard our nation’s growing reliance on global commerce.50 This full-throated call for a robust blend of offensive and defensive space weaponry reflects a strategic principle elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens,</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">“<span style="background-color: yellow;">anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand</span>.”</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">51</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent “dual capability” of spaceborne weapon components</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. To the extent that</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">ballistic missile interceptors</span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such </span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">interceptors</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">can</span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">also</span> </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">be used as orbiting “death stars,” capable of sending munitions hurtling through the earth’s atmosphere at dizzying velocities</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">.52 As Marc</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Vidricaire, a member of the Canadian Delegation to the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, explains: “If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">.”53 Furthermore,</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">spaceborne BMD components can be used for offensive attacks in outer space itself, where orbiting space assets belonging to adversaries could be targeted for destruction</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. According to defense analyst James E. Oberg, “…the benign, defensive nature of a ballistic missile killer is not the only facet of such a system—it also has inherent offensive capability against satellites.”54</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">This</span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">dual capability of BMD systems</span> </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">provides one rationale for why space weapons advocates such as Senator Smith propose to make offensive attack weapons part of missile defense</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. In a world where deployment of purely offensive space weaponry might be difficult to justify as a stand-alone military initiative, Oberg speculates, “the means by which the placement of space-based weapons will likely occur is under a second U.S. space policy directive—that of ballistic missile defense.”55 Although these “death star” scenarios might seem like they come straight out of Hollywood special effects studios,</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">it is worth noting that the U.S. Space Command is on record endorsing military strategy that favors weaponization of space</span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">as a force multiplier</span> </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">for offensive attack missions</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. An official planning document entitled “Vision for 2020” foresees “space-based strike weapons” as part of “global engagement capabilities” designed to enable “application of precision force from, through, and to space.”56 Aggressive pursuit of these “strike weapons” is imperative, according to Space Command officials, because “space superiority is emerging as an essential element of battlefield success and future warfare.”57 Arguing that “it is inevitable that mankind will weaponize space,” Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas D. Bell claims in a 1999 paper that, “The U.S. ability to conduct combat operations in this environment will provide the technical asymmetry that the U.S. will need to win the next war, just as it used strategic bombers and the atomic bomb to win World War II and stealth technology and precision guided munitions to win the Gulf War.”58 These plans recently received concrete expression in comments from Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, Air Force Space Command Commander. While addressing a group at the Joint Tactical Ground Station in South Korea, Eberhart declared that “[s]pace is the ultimate high ground…Not only do we have to use it, we have to be able to defend it and deny our enemy the use of space if we are at war…we have to ensure space superiority for our commanders and men and women who rely on it during the fight.”59</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Although missile defense advocates frequently trumpet the “purely defensive” nature of BMD, such systems exist in</span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">a strategic framework</span> </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">that ineluctably includes offensive space weaponry</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. “The PR spin is that the U.S. military push into space is about missile defense or defense of U.S. space satellites. But</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">the volumes of material coming out of the military are concerned mainly with offense— with using space to establish military domination over the world below</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">,” notes professor Karl Grossman.60</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Such</span></span> <span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">a suggestion</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">carries particular significance for</span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">Japan</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, since as Frank Umbach, Senior Research Fellow at the German Society of Foreign Affairs, explains, “</span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">a possible Japanese TMD deploymen</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">t</span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">may require an integration of the anti-missile defense command and control (</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">C-2) systems of Japan and the U.S., which could have far-reaching implications for both sides.”61 Eventual deployment of a joint Japan-U.S. TMD system could saddle Japanese officials with the sober responsibility of making command decisions regarding use of spaceborne weapons for offensive military missions. It is tempting to take comfort in the idea that JDA leaders would not permit a joint missile defense system such as NTW to evolve into a platform for offensive space power, especially since such a development would flout Japanese legal and constitutional prohibitions against such military adventures. However, in a joint command situation,</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">it is not clear that</span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> <span class="small">such</span> </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">constraints would hold up, especially in light of intimidating comments</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> by space power enthusiasts such as Senator Smith, who vows to use his position on Capitol Hill to ram space weaponry down the throats of opponents, regardless of how vocal they are</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">: “If the Air Force cannot or will not embrace spacepower, we in Congress will have to drag them there, kicking and screaming if necessary.”62 Another possibility is that Japanese objections against incorporation of offensive space power into a joint missile defense program could be rendered moot by strategic deception. Part II of this essay explored cases where U.S. missile defense advocates deployed subterfuge to camouflage the actual purpose of BMD programs, in order to insulate the program from political criticism. A similar approach would seem politically attractive for public affairs officers dealing with the sensitive issue of a Japanese TMD’s offensive military capabilities. Since such capabilities would clearly prove to be public relations liabilities for missile defense advocates attempting to justify TMD to Asian publics,</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">there could be great institutional inertia to pursue a Pentagon-style public relations strategy of hiding such capabilities behind layers of secrecy</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">, classification, and obfuscation</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, then dominating public debate with talk of “purely defensive” BMD systems. However,</span></span> <span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">ba</span><span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">ck door deployment of offensive space weapons would pose grave security risks, given the potentially disastrous consequences of an unconstrained arms race in space</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Lt. Col. Bell provides a glimpse of some of the varieties of space weapons that might be produced in such a scenario: “A mix of space weapons will offer the capability to destroy various types of surface and sub-surface targets with three types of weapons: continuous</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">lasers</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> that use heat to melt structures and destroy them; pulsed lasers <span style="background-color: yellow;">that vaporize material</span> and penetrate the structure; <span style="background-color: yellow;">and kinetic energy weapons that provide the capability to attack targets hundreds of feet under the</span> surface of the <span style="background-color: yellow;">earth</span></span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">.”63 According to Senator Charles S. Robb (D-VA),</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">space weaponization could transform Reagan’s hopeful Star Wars vision into an ominous “death star” future</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. During the Reagan years, advocates of the Strategic Defense Initiative ran an effective television spot featuring children being saved from nuclear attack by a shield represented by a rainbow. If we weaponize space, we will face a very different image—the image of</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">hundreds of</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">weapons</span>-laden <span style="background-color: yellow;">satellites orbiting</span> directly <span style="background-color: yellow;">over our homes and our families 24 hours a day, ready to fire within seconds</span></span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. If fired, they would destroy thousands of ground, air, and space targets within minutes, before there is even a chance of knowing what has happened, or why. This would be a dark future, a future we should avoid at all costs.64 A buildup of space weapons with capability to execute offensive missions might begin with noble intentions of “peace through strength” deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that “…the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use.”65</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Military commanders desiring to harness the precision strike capability afforded by spacebased “smart” weapons might order deliberate attacks on enemy ground targets in a crisis</span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense “use or lose” pressure into strategic calculations</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, with the specter of split-second laser attacks</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">creating incentives to rig orbiting death stars <span style="background-color: yellow;">with automated “hair trigger” devices</span></span></span><span class="small"><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However,</span></span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict</span></span><span class="small"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed “complexly interactive, tightly coupled” industrial systems, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other’s flawless performance.

<u>China's position on TMD is largely influenced by its profound mistrust of Japan, which dates back to the Japanese annexation of Manchuria in 1931 and atrocities committed during World War II.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Ambassador Sha has stated, &quot;We are still suffering from our nightmare with Japan since the war. These are a people who even deny the fact that there was something called the Nanking Massacre; some of them feel it didn't happen at all. </span><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">So how can we have any confidence in a country like that?&quot;21 Despite China's strong opposition to TMD cooperation with Japan, PRC officials have indicated a willingness to accept deployment of lower-tier TMD in Japan</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>China considers lower-tier theater missile defenses to be &quot;legitimate&quot; missile defenses since these systems have a limited footprint that can only protect small areas such as military bases and troop deployments from missile attack</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s.22 </span><u>China's concerns about Japan's development of an upper-tier TMD system, especially a sea-based one, are based on the fear that such a system would also be capable of defending Taiwan in the event of a missile attack from the mainland.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The US Navy's Theater Wide (NTW) system could be based in Japan but still be easily deployed near Taiwan. </span><u>According to a 1999 Pentagon report, one Aegis cruiser equipped with the NTW system could defend all of Taiwan. China's Opposition to National Missile Defense China's vehement opposition to US NMD plans is based on two main arguments. On the one hand, China is concerned that US efforts to modify the ABM Treaty and plans to deploy a multi-site NMD system will severely undermine China's small strategic deterrent capability. On the other hand, US NMD plans would lead to a complete halt to US-Russian strategic arms reductions, a possible resumption of an arms race and a general deterioration in other global arms control and nonproliferation efforts such as CTBT ratification and negotiation of a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT).</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23 Chinese analysts argue that the </span><u>United States has exaggerated the risk of rogue nations developing long range missiles with nuclear warheads.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Chinese experts have argued that spending the time and resources on </span><u>developing NMD in response to the rogue-nation missile threat is akin to &quot;using a cannon to hit a fly.&quot; US retaliatory capabilities are sufficient to deter rogue nations from launching an attack</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Many Chinese further maintain that the </span><u>United States is using the rogue missile threat as &quot;a pretext&quot; to develop and deploy NMD, when its actual purpose is to contain China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Undermining China's Strategic Nuclear Deterrent China's primary concern is that NMD will downgrade or negate China's strategic nuclear deterrent. </span><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">China's nuclear arsenal is the smallest of the five declared nuclear powers and is centered around about 20 land-based ICBMs</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>China's strategic nuclear forces are mostly based upon woefully outdated 1950s and 1960s aircraft and missile technologies. China's nuclear capable bombers lack sufficient range and are too slow to penetrate modern air defenses. The</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> bulk of China's ICBM forces are liquid-fueled, based at fixed sites (including highly vulnerable silos) and require lengthy launch preparation. China is believed to store its nuclear warheads separate from its missiles, further increasing launch preparation time. </span><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Although the PRC has begun to modernize its long-range missile force by developing solid fueled, road-mobile systems, none of these missiles have been deployed.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> China conducted its first flight-test of its new 8000 km range DF-31 missile in August 1999; the 13000 km range DF-41 is still under development. Finally, China's single Xia-class submarine is virtually non-operational. </span><u>With such a small, technologically inferior force, China is concerned that a missile defense system would render its second strike capability impotent and thus enable the United States to use nuclear blackmail against China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Collapse of US-Russian Arms Control Efforts </span><u>China is also concerned that NMD deployment will halt US-Russian arms reduction efforts such as Russia's ratification of the START II treaty and negotiations on a START III treaty</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Russia may refuse to continue to reduce its nuclear arsenal or Russia may backtrack on some of commitments by retaining a small number of land-based MIRVd missiles</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (which are banned under START II). Russia's response to NMD could also degrade China's deterrent capabilities. Russian deployment of new missiles or refusal to reduce its current arsenal significantly affects China given the small size of China's force relative to Russia's and the possibility of renewed Sino-Russian conflict. A Russian decision to continue nuclear testing could also threaten China if Russia develops new types of nuclear weapons or smaller warheads that could be MRVed. </span><u>Chinese Efforts to Counter NMD China has identified three ways to counter NMD: (1) expanding its missile force; (2) developing countermeasures such as penetration aids; and (3) developing multiple reentry vehicle (MRV) or multiple independently targeted reentry vehicle (MIRV) technology. However, it has been difficult to separate Chinese ballistic missile development and deployment efforts aimed at overcoming ballistic missile defenses from China's general strategic modernization program.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As early as 1981 China delivered three satellites with one launch vehicle, indicating an incipient MRV capability. According to a leaked 1999 National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC) report, China's 2 August 1999 test launch of the DF-31 ICBM included the use of penetration aids.24 While development of penetration aids suggests that China is seeking to overcome future missile defenses, to date China has not engaged in a rapid increase in its ICBM force. China is developing new missiles such as the DF-31 and DF-41, but these programs were initiated over a decade ago and were probably not a direct response to NMD. Despite these indications, China has stated that it will not enter an arms race with the United States.25 Having seen the demise of the Soviet Union, Chinese leaders do not want to sacrifice China's economic modernization in a costly arms race with the United States. M</span><u>atching the United States missile for missile or developing a Chinese NMD system would require diverting billions of US dollars and many of China's brightest minds away from economic modernization.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This reallocation of resources would only delay China's emergence as a world power and ultimately hinder China's overall military modernization. China's Anti-NMD Diplomatic Offensive China has launched a broad diplomatic effort to oppose US efforts to modify the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and to deploy NMD. Bilaterally, China has begun cooperating with Russia to denounce NMD as a violation of the ABM Treaty and to halt US efforts to modify the ABM Treaty. </span><u>Multilaterally, China has used the Conference on Disarmament (CD) to oppose missile defense (and especially space-based missile defenses).</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Opposition to Revision of ABM Treaty China opposes any revisions to the ABM Treaty that would allow deployment of new missile defense systems. </span><u>In a speech before the United Nations, China's deputy director general of arms control, Hu Xiaodi, has stated: the ABM Treaty is, however, now confronted with grave challenges flowing from some recent negative developments in the international situation. In seeking its own absolute security and strategic advantage, a state party to the Treaty is now not only vigorously pursuing its own NMD program, but also pressing rapidly ahead with its joint TMD development program with some other individual countries.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Such moves not only fly in the face of the purposes and principles of the Treaty, but are also very much at odds with the core provision of the Treaty.26 China believes that initial US moves to amend the Treaty will only be followed by requests for more amendments, which will eviscerate the Treaty. Sha Zukang has stated: We can say with certainty that once the treaty is amended, it will be amended again and again because of the change of situations, and finally it will be nullified. If so, the &quot;Anti-Missile Treaty&quot; will exist in name only and will be a mere scrap of paper. We hope that the United States will start afresh, give up the treaty amendment attempt, and return to the correct track of really safeguarding the ABM Treaty.27 As part of its effort to pressure the United States not to modify the ABM Treaty, China has begun cooperating with Russia to condemn US efforts to develop missile defense systems. On 14 April 1999, China and Russia released a joint press communiqué on the ABM Treaty which stated that &quot;to preserve and strengthen the ABM Treaty is of critical importance&quot; and that the ABM Treaty is the &quot;cornerstone for maintaining global strategic stability.&quot; The statement also committed both sides to continue &quot;consultations and cooperation&quot; on efforts to preserve the ABM Treaty.28 As a result of this cooperation, on 21 October 1999 China co-sponsored a Russian resolution at the United Nations entitled, &quot;Prevention and Compliance with Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.&quot; The resolution called for &quot;renewed efforts by each of the states parties to preserve and strengthen the ABM Treaty through full and strict compliance.&quot;</span><u>29 However, Sino-Russian cooperation has thus far been limited to rhetoric. Responding to a question on whether Chinese and Russian opposition to missile defense systems would result in cooperative efforts, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji stated that while both countries are opposed to missile defenses, it &quot;did not mean that [we] have already discussed joint measures to counter this program.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The time has not yet come for that.&quot;30 Despite Sino-Russian cooperation on revisting changes in the ABM Treaty, </span><u>Chinese officials are aware that US NMD deployment would not threaten the credibility of Russia's deterrent</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. They worry that Russia will ultimately compromise with the United States on ABM Treaty revisions at the expense of Chinese interests. </span><u>China has also proposed making the ABM Treaty a multilateral accord.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31 By becoming a member of the ABM Treaty China would be able to influence negotiations between the United States and Russia, strengthening Russia's opposition to amending the Treaty. </span><u>China would also be able to prevent the transfer of missile defense technology from the United States to Russia as payment for Russia's approval of the amendments to the Treaty</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This effort indicates Chinese fears that Russia will agree to modifications of the ABM treaty that harm China's strategic interests. </span><u>Opposition at the Conference on Disarmament China has also used multilateral fora such as the Conference on Disarmament (CD) to express its opposition to ABM revisions and NMD deployment. Believing that the development of missile defenses will lead to arms race in outer space, China has repeatedly called for the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of An Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS).</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The United States has opposed such efforts. </span><u>In a 13 October 1999 speech to the United Nations General Assembly, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations Shen Guofang condemned US efforts to block the formation of such a committee: A certain country has, on the one hand, tried hard to block the establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on PAROS at the Conference on Disarmament, but on the other hand, pressed rapidly ahead in pursuing its outer space and missile defense programs in an attempt to seek military advantage on the ground through dominating and controlling outer space</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. . .The development in the vigorous pursuit of missile defense systems since the beginning of this year is most disturbing.32 </span><u>Since China currently lacks the resources to compete with the United States in an outer space arms race, it fears that deployment of space-based weapons could give the United States an overwhelming edge and the ability to negate China's nuclear deterrent for years to come.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">China is also concerned that an arms race with the technologically superior United States could derail China's economic growth. Although China has a vibrant space program, it would require years and billions of dollars to even approach US space defense technology. China's Indigenous Missile Defense Capabilities China is not opposed to every form of missile defense</span><u>. China considers lower-tier theater missile defenses to be &quot;legitimate&quot; missile defenses since these systems can only protect small areas from missile attacks. China's approval of lower-tier missile defenses also stems from the fact that China has purchased S-300 (NATO designation: SA-10) anti-aircraft missile systems from Russia which have an inherent anti-missile capability</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. According to an unconfirmed source, China is also developing its own TMD, called KDI. KDI is said to have a range of 25 km with a maximum speed of Mach 4 and is capable of hitting a number of missiles.33China and Russia have reportedly discussed the potential for cooperation in the missile defense area, but to date there has been no evidence that any specific development efforts are underway.34 </span><br />

<strong>Empirically proven BMD development causes restructuring of Article 9- Upper Tier pushes it to the brink</strong><br />
<strong>Toki 8</strong> “Under Fukuda, Japan Accelerates Ballistic Missile Defense Cooperation with the United States”<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In December 2007, U.S.-Japan BMD cooperation reached a new milestone when the Japanese Maritime Self- Defense Force (MSDF) successfully conducted its first missile intercept test. </span><u>The test also indicated that Japan’s new <span style="background-color: yellow;">Prime Minister</span> Yasuo <span style="background-color: yellow;">Fukuda may be as strong a supporter of BMD</span> as his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, who resigned in September 2007.</u> <u>Abe had been vigorously <span style="background-color: yellow;">advocating the revision</span> or reinterpretation <span style="background-color: yellow;">of Article 9</span> of Japan’s constitution in order to allow Japan to deploy a more extensive BMD system and to cooperate more fully in collective self-defense with the United States</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Fukuda, while not as vocal on these issues, has continued to accelerate the deployment of BMD systems and push for closer security cooperation with Washington. (Most recently, he promoted the Diet’s January 11 passage of a bill to extend the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law to allow the Japanese MSDF to continue its refueling mission in the Indian Ocean, as part of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.) [1] </span><u>While Fukuda is continuing Japan’s push toward a more robust BMD system, <span style="background-color: yellow;">BMD faces on-going opposition in Japan</span>, based both on its costs and its potential to roil relations with China. Transition from Abe to Fukuda <span style="background-color: yellow;">Prime Minister</span> Fukuda is generally perceived as more moderate than Abe, who was famous for his conservative nationalism and outspoken support</u> <u>of BMD.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In his October 2007 policy statement to the 168th session of the Diet, for example, Fukuda did not directly mention missile defense or collective self-defense with the United States; in contrast, </span><u>Abe <span style="background-color: yellow;">continually highlighted </span>these issues, particularly <span style="background-color: yellow;">his desire to amend Article 9, which currently bars</span> collective <span style="background-color: yellow;">self-defense</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [2] (Fukuda’s silence on missile defense issues in his statement derived, in part, from the need to stress more urgent agenda items facing his cabinet, particularly the extension of the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law.) </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">As part of</span> his <span style="background-color: yellow;">efforts to foster</span> closer <span style="background-color: yellow;">cooperation with the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span>tates, in April 2007, Abe formed a 13-member “Council on Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security” to make recommendations to the Cabinet by September 2007 on issues related to whether Japan should revise its interpretation of the constitution to allow collective self-defense.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Such a change would be needed to permit Japan to participate in a joint missile defense system with the United States that was intended to protect the latter, as well as Japan. [3] However, after the devastating defeat of Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the Upper House Election in July 2007 and Abe’s sudden resignation in September, the Council’s members reportedly decided to delay making their recommendations. In early January Japanese media outlets reported that the Council planned to submit its recom-mendation by mid-January; however, as of January 24, a search of Japanese media failed to reveal whether the recommendations had been submitted to Prime Minister Fukuda. </span><u>The Council had been expected to recommend that Japan interpret its constitution to allow collective self-defense, as Abe advocated. However, <span style="background-color: yellow;">Fukuda’s policy is unlikely to reflect these recommendations</span>, as he is reluctant to <span style="background-color: yellow;">revise the interpretation of Article 9</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Thus, in effect, the submission of a report will be largely ceremonial, formally completing the work of the Council. [4] Media sources have suggested that, given Fukuda’s cautious attitude toward the collective self-defense debate, he might seal any recommendations offered by the Council. [5] </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">However, Fukuda may not be able to avoid</span> more active <span style="background-color: yellow;">engagement</span> on the collective self-defense issue <span style="background-color: yellow;">for long</span>. Currently, the <span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan</span>ese <span style="background-color: yellow;">and U.S. governments are jointly developing</span> an advanced version of the Standard Missile-3 <span style="background-color: yellow;">(SM-3) Block II A missile to improve</span> its <span style="background-color: yellow;">defensive capabilities</span> against longer-range missiles, such as the Taepodong. [6] <span style="background-color: yellow;">The</span> new <span style="background-color: yellow;">SM-3 is scheduled to be available by 2014. If Japan decides to deploy</span> the advanced version of <span style="background-color: yellow;">the SM-3</span>, in addition to the current version, theoretically, Japan would also have the capability to intercept a missile heading for the United States. Thus, the decision to deploy <span style="background-color: yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">the advanced SM-3 version would rekindle the debate over Article 9</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. [7] Opposition to BMD in Japan remains significant, based primarily on the considerable cost of the system. [8] According to the Ministry of Defense, the missile defense program is estimated to cost between 800 billion yen ($7.4 billion) and one trillion yen ($8.9 billion) through 2012. However, since Japan plans to continue to pursue still more advanced technologies, costs are likely to increase well beyond this amount. [9] According to the Ministry of Defense, fiscal year 2007, because it was the first year of actual deployment, is expected to mark the greatest annual expenditure for missile defense to date – 186.3 billion yen ($1.7 billion). [10] </span><u>The total budget allocated for missile defense for fiscal year 2008 is 171.4 billion yen ($1.6 billion), only slightly lower than 2007. [11] Some Japanese defense industry officials assert that the domestic defense industry does not benefit from the government’s spending on BMD, because U.S.-developed and built SM-3s are used for flight tests</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. [12] </span><u>In response to such criticism, Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba has insisted, “We can’t talk about how much money should be spent when human lives are at stake</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” [13] </span><br />

<strong>The Japanese model article 9 spills over globally to solve every instance of war and environmental degradation</strong><br />
<strong>Jain 7</strong> [Speech of Hon'ble Mr. Justice Vijender Jain, Chief Justice, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh (India) in a Conference on Global Article 9 at Tokyo, Japan]<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution contains “No war” clause. It came into effect on May 3, 1947, immediately after World War II. The text of the article of the Japanese Government formally renounce war as a right of sovereignty and the refuses to settle disputes using military force. The Article also states that military forces with war potential will not be maintained. A few of the preamble’s relevant words are: “We, the Japanese people, . . . proclaim that sovereign power resides with the people. . . .” and “We, the Japanese people, desire peace for all time and are deeply conscious of the high ideals 1 controlling human relationship, and we have determined to preserve our security and existence, trusting in the justice and faith of the peace-loving peoples of the world. We desire to occupy an honored place in an international society striving for the preservation of peace, and the banishment of tyranny and slavery, oppression and intolerance for all time from the earth. We recognize that all peoples of the world have the right to live in peace, free from fear and want.” The failure of the collective security of the League of Nations led to the realization that a universal system of security could only be effective if nations agreed to some limitation of their national sovereignty with regard to their right to go to war. Like the German Article 24, which was incorporated in the post-war German Constitution, and which provides for delegating or limiting sovereign powers in favor of collective security, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Article 9</span> was added to 2 the Constitution of Japan during the occupation following World War II. Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution not only forbids the use of force as a means to settling international disputes but also forbids Japan from maintaining an army, navy or air force. Therefore, in strictly legal terms, the Self Defense Forces are not an army, navy and air force, but are extensions of the national police force. This <span style="background-color: yellow;">has had broad implications for foreign, security and defense policy</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> According to a May 2007 opinion poll conducted by the Asahi Shimbun, a national newspaper with the second largest readership in Japan, in May 2007, nearly 80% of the population recognized that “</span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Article 9 has helped maintain peace in Japan</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” With regard to a constitutional revision, although nearly 60% answered that a constitutional revision is necessary, less than 20% supported the idea of having a Self-Defense Army by changing Article 9. With regard to the revision of Article 9 specifically, almost 50% preferred not to change it, 3 while 30% supported change. I have fallen deeply and profoundly in love with the beautiful wisdom that is Article 9 of Japan’s Constitution and the wonderfully related words in that Constitution’s preamble. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Article 9</span> as not just Japan’s but <span style="background-color: yellow;">as all humanity’s cry for an end t</span>o that <span style="background-color: yellow;">brutal,</span> dominantly masculine <span style="background-color: yellow;">obscenity called war</span>. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Article 9, metaphorically</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">as having risen out of the radioactive ashes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</span> and out of the holocaust that was World War II. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Article 9 as Japan’s apology to all the</span> nations of East and Southeast Asia <span style="background-color: yellow;">that suffered from its militarism</span> before and during World War II. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Article 9 as Japan’s promise</span> to those nations <span style="background-color: yellow;">that never again will</span> this <span style="background-color: yellow;">militarist scourge be unleashed on the world</span>. Thus I see <span style="background-color: yellow;">Article 9 as a mode</span>l <span style="background-color: yellow;">to be emulated by all nations</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on Planet Earth before we eliminate all life from mother earth. </span><u>Increasingly ominous application o<span style="background-color: yellow;">f</span> engineering and scientific knowledge and talents to ever more lethal means to kill and destroy and by our inequitable consumptions of Earth’s resources, globally warming 4 ourselves to death by turning these bountiful resource gifts into irretrievable high-entropy waste streams</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Article 9 as</span> its badge of honor, Japan is d<span style="background-color: yellow;">emonstrating</span> to Planet Earth, <span style="background-color: yellow;">nonviolent and nonmilitary solutions to</span> our <span style="background-color: yellow;">inevitable human</span> and ecospheric <span style="background-color: yellow;">conflicts</span> and problems.</u> <u>Since most people on Planet Earth have never heard of Article 9, this conference will contribute in shaking and awakening the whole world to Article 9’s wisdom.</u> <u>I see a world that needs to collectively organize itself so as to permit and massively encourage Japan to demonstrate nonviolent, nonmilitary means to prevent wars and violence and means for resolving our inevitable human conflicts under “rules of law” rather than under “rules of war.”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> What is wrong with encouraging Japan to demonstrate how we, with appropriate use of our science and engineering talents, might keep our beautiful Planet Earth from becoming another lifeless Mars? 5 </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The current situation</span> in Japan <span style="background-color: yellow;">is not so healthy for Article</span> 9, and a major external threat to Article 9 comes from out side to be able to use Japanese SelfDefense Forces. Japanese peace activists are going global with their Article 9 campaign, inspired by the 1999 Hague Appeal for Peace’s call that “<span style="background-color: yellow;">every Parliament should adopt a resolution</span> prohibiting their government from going to war, <span style="background-color: yellow;">like</span> the Japanese <span style="background-color: yellow;">Article 9,”</span> and the 2006 Vancouver World Peace Forum’s declaration that “We call for governments to constitutionally renounce wa</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">r (e.g. Japan’s Article 9).” </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">In order to break the cycle of war and violence worldwide</span>, the Global Article 9 Campaign to Abolish War encourages the peoples and governments of the world to adopt peace laws similar to Article 9 in every country, and <span style="background-color: yellow;">work towards demilitarization</span> and a culture of peace. The campaign articulates nine mechanisms for peace that include reductions in military spending, promotion of nuclear-weapon-free zones, ending violence against women, supporting 6 conflict prevention, and mitigating the negative environmental impact of the military. International civil society organizations have recognized <span style="background-color: yellow;">the global impact of Article 9,</span> including its relevance <span style="background-color: yellow;">in regards to human rights</span>, disarmament, nuclear weapons abolition, conflict prevention, development, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the environment</span>, globalization, UN reform <span style="background-color: yellow;">and other global issues.</span></u> <u>The world today remains threatened by the continuation of violent conflicts, the proliferation of arms, and environmental destruction. Within this situation, Article 9 paves the way for the adoption of non-violent alternatives to dealing with such international crises. This movement thus demonstrates that <span style="background-color: yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Article 9 is not merely a domestic Japanese</span> issue; rather, <span style="background-color: yellow;">it is one of</span> immediate <span style="background-color: yellow;">international relevance</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This growing international movement of support makes clear that the world does value Article 9 as an ideal to which all people aspire, as a model to follow. 7 The Article 9 Campaign demonstrates the active value of Article 9 and proposes ways to realize its potential. To that end, the Campaign links Article 9 to other international norms and institutions, notably the United Nations, whose Charter calls for decreases in military expenditure and the reallocation of limited resources to solving poverty and to protecting humans from war and violence. I earnestly seek an “</span><u>Article 9 Without Borders” for all of Planet Earth - <span style="background-color: yellow;">so that we as a species</span>, and all other species, and Earth itself - <span style="background-color: yellow;">might continue to exist</span>.</u><br />

<u>It is not easy to predict Japan’s future path. <span style="background-color: yellow;">The outlines of Japan’s security policy</span>—the <span style="background-color: yellow;">realignment</span> of the U.S. forces in Japan, <span style="background-color: yellow;">BMD, space development,</span> and the demands of the business sector—<span style="background-color: yellow;">were all established</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> during the Bush-Koizumi era. </span><u>The <span style="background-color: yellow;">Obama</span> and Hatoyama administrations <span style="background-color: yellow;">might uphold this</span> new status quo, <span style="background-color: yellow;">or</span> they might <span style="background-color: yellow;">set off in very different directions</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Hatoyama government is, for now, buying time before making any major decisions on basic security policy. Under the previous government of Aso Taro, a report by an advisory panel to the prime minister on Japan’s future security was presented in June 2008. </span><u>The key thrust of this panel was to change constitutional interpretation in order to allow the exercise of the right to collective self-defense.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This report was essentially the supreme expression of the “defense reform” built by the Bush and Koizumi regimes. According to this plan, revision of the National Defense Program Guidelines and the Mid-Term Defense Program were also planned for the end of 2009. However, Prime Minister Hatoyama decided to postpone revision of defense policy by one year. He has also announced the establishment of a new panel of experts. Currently, the United States spends 42 percent of the $1.46 trillion dollars of annual global military expenditures, and East Asia is responsible for 13 percent. Furthermore, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">military expenditure</span> in East Asia <span style="background-color: yellow;">is increasing</span> at a speed, which is pronounced even on an international scale. East Asia, home to an enormous U.S. military presence, is <span style="background-color: yellow;">becoming the world’s largest weapons market. <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Japan has considerable latent potential to contribute to the freezing and reduction of regional, and global, military expenditure</span></strong></span><strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">s</span></strong>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Although Japan’s military expenditures remain quite high by global standards, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan could set <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">an important example</span></span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> for other countries</span> <span style="background-color: yellow;">by not increasing this amount</span> and remaining within a standard of less than 1 percent of the GDP.</u> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The key issue is whether Japan will </span>continue to <span style="background-color: yellow;">develop</span> high-tech military technology relating to <span style="background-color: yellow;">BMD</span> or not.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Japanese government and the Japanese public must answer a set of questions connected to these systems. Do they really function? What exactly is this system trying to protect, and from what? Is Japanese industry and technology just being mobilized in order to assume the place of U.S. defense? Is there a calm, efficient, and alternative method to removing the missile threat other than developing intercepting missiles? <strong>Toward Innovative Disarmament Cooperation</strong> </span><u>Japanese and U.S. <span style="background-color: yellow;">development</span> of missile defense and related technology <span style="background-color: yellow;">is</span> clearly <span style="background-color: yellow;">stimulating a backlash from China</span>. <span style="background-color: yellow;">This</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in turn, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">helps China justify the modernization of its nuclear</span> missile <span style="background-color: yellow;">forces, leading to</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">promotion <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">of a regional arms race</span></strong></span><strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> and a worsening of the regional security environment.</span></strong> It is possible</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, through coordinated regional diplomacy and strengthened transparency and verification measures, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">to remove the</span> nuclear and <span style="background-color: yellow;">missile threats</span> in a cooperative manner. Such an approach <span style="background-color: yellow;">would increase confidence</span> within the region, <span style="background-color: yellow;">improve</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">security</span> environment, <span style="background-color: yellow;">ensure</span> that regional <span style="background-color: yellow;">resources are not being wastefully invested</span> in military purposes, <span style="background-color: yellow;">and bring us </span>closer <span style="background-color: yellow;">to</span> building a sustainable <span style="background-color: yellow;">peace in East Asia</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">To the extent that the realignment of U.S. forces reinforces U.S. regional and global power projection capabilities—</span><u>rather than functioning as a cost-saving mechanism or as a means to enhance collective security—the backlash in Northeast Asia will be strengthened.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">If North Korea were to view the realignment of U.S. bases in Japan and South Korea as a threat, it will be less likely to follow through on denuclearization. If the relocation of U.S. bases leads to the construction of new bases within Japan or elsewhere, and increases expenses to that end, a key opportunity will have been lost. In order to serve the purpose of regional peace, the realignment of U.S. bases must be used to close redundant bases and promote their withdrawal. The new Hatoyama government is re-examining and trying to readjust the alliance with the United States in the name of “equal partnership” while also calling for the creation of an East Asia Community. </span><u>Japan must not be misunderstood as reviving its early 20th-century ambitions for military hegemony in the region. <span style="background-color: yellow;">The</span> military spending <span style="background-color: yellow;">issue can be a breakthrough for Japan</span>, a way <span style="background-color: yellow;">to show</span> its <span style="background-color: yellow;">commitment to peace</span> while contributing to the construction of a new regional order. Japan should initiate</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> negotiations with China and Korea toward a mutually coordinated freeze and </span><u>reduction in military expenditure. Rather than abandoning its ties with the U.S. military industry, <span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan should use the arms-export ban principle to</span> negotiate and <span style="background-color: yellow;">establish a regional framework to curb</span> the arms trade and weapons <span style="background-color: yellow;">proliferation</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">In 1967, Prime Minister Sato Eisaku introduced Japan’s Three Non-Nuclear Principles: not possessing, producing, or permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons. The Diet established these principles as national policy through a resolution in 1971. However, despite the “non-introduction” provision, considerable evidence indicates the existence of secret deals between the U.S. and Japanese government to allow the transit and port-calls of nuclear-weapons-equipped vessels, even since 1960. The Hatoyama government has established a commission to look into these secret deals. It is important to legalize these three principles to prevent a reintroduction of nuclear weapons into Japan. Legalizing the Non-Nuclear Principles will also create momentum for a nuclear weapon free zone in Northeast Asia that would, in turn, strengthen the nonproliferation regime in the region. Despite the advocacy of Keidanren</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>a concentrated investment in high-tech, military-civilian integrated technology would not lead to overall benefits for the Japanese economy. Such investments would have little economic effect</u> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">for the vast majority of the Japanese labor force working in small or mid-size business. If Japan were to throw away its reputation as a “peaceful nation,” which it has maintained throughout the post-war era, the Japanese economy, so dependent on trade with Asia and the Middle East, would necessarily suffer. Instead of viewing the Self-Defense Forces as a way to boost employment, the Japanese government should establish an independent organization with straightforward humanitarian purposes such as disaster relief. Through exchange and humanitarian activities with and in neighboring countries, such an organization could reduce military expenditures and build regional confidence</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The development of innovative cooperation for disarmament is now needed. At this critical juncture in history, <span style="background-color: yellow;">only a cooperative-security approach can lead the way to the creation of a new order of peace.</span></u><br />

Further, the large number of states that became capable of building nuclear weapons over the years, but chose not to, can be reasonably well explained by the fact that most were formally allied with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Both these superpowers had strong nuclear forces and put great pressure on their allies not to build nuclear weapons. <span class="underline">Since the Cold War</span>, the US has retained all its allies. In addition, NATO has extended its protection to some of the previous allies of the Soviet Union and plans on taking in more. <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Nuclear proliferation</span> by India and Pakistan, and proliferation programmes by North Korea, Iran and Iraq, all <span style="background-color: yellow;">involve states in the opposite situation</span>: all judged that they faced serious military opposition and had little prospect of establishing a reliable supporting alliance with a suitably strong, nuclear-armed state</span>. What would await the world if strong protectors, especially the United States, were [was] no longer seen as willing to protect states from nuclear-backed aggression? At least a few additional <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">states</span></span> would <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">begin to build their own nuclear weapons</span> and the means to deliver</span> them to <span class="underline">distant targets</span>, and <span class="underline">these initiatives would spur <span style="background-color: yellow;">increasing numbers of the world’s </span><strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">capable states to follow suit</span></strong></span><span style="background-color: yellow;">. <span class="underline">Restraint would seem</span></span><span class="underline"> ever <span style="background-color: yellow;">less necessary</span> and ever more dangerous.</span> Meanwhile, <span class="underline">more states are becoming capable of building nuclear weapons</span> and long-range missiles. Many, perhaps most, of the world’s states are becoming sufficiently wealthy, and the technology for building nuclear forces continues to improve and spread. Finally, <span class="underline">it seems highly likely that at some point, halting proliferation will come to be seen as a lost cause and the restraints on it will disappear</span>. Once that happens<span style="background-color: yellow;">, </span><span class="underline"><strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">the transition</span></strong> <strong>to a highly proliferated world <span style="background-color: yellow;">would</span> probably <span style="background-color: yellow;">be very rapid</span></strong></span><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> While some regions might be able to hold the line for a time, the <span class="underline">threats posed by wildfire proliferation</span> in most other areas could <span class="underline">create pressures that would finally overcome all restraint. </span>Many <span class="underline">readers</span> are probably willing to <span class="underline">accept that nuclear proliferation is such a grave threat to world peace that every effort should be made to avoid it. However, every effort has not been made in the past</span>, and we are talking about much more substantial efforts now. For new and substantially more burdensome efforts to be made to slow or stop nuclear proliferation, it needs to be established that the highly proliferated nuclear world that would sooner or later evolve without such efforts is not going to be acceptable. And, for many reasons, it is not. First, the <span class="underline">dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous</span>. <span class="underline"><strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">Proliferating states will feel great pressures to obtain nuclear weapons and delivery systems before any potential opponent does.</span></strong> Those who succeed in outracing an opponent</span> <span style="background-color: yellow;">may </span><span class="underline"><strong>consider preemptive nuclear war</strong> before the opponent becomes capable of nuclear retaliation. Those who lag behind might try to preempt their opponent’s nuclear programme or defeat the opponent using conventional forces</span>. And <span class="underline">those who feel threatened</span> but are incapable of building nuclear weapons may still be able to <span class="underline">join in this arms race by building other types of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological weapons</span>. [The article continues…] The war between Iran and Iraq during the 1980s led to the use of chemical weapons on both sides and exchanges of missiles against each other’s cities. And more recently, <span class="underline">violence in the Middle East escalated in a few months from rocks and small arms to heavy weapons on one side, and from police actions to air strikes and armoured attacks on the other. <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">Escalation of violence is also basic human nature</span></strong><strong>.</strong> Once the violence starts, <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">retaliatory exchanges</span></strong> of violent acts <span style="background-color: yellow;">can escalate</span> to levels unimagined</span> by the participants before hand. <span class="underline">Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse</span>. And such anger can lead us to impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible. In sum, widespread <span class="underline">proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons,</span> and that <span class="underline">such <span style="background-color: yellow;">shoot-outs will have </span><strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possible</span></strong> with the weapons at hand</span>. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we <span class="underline">are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild West</span> of the late 1800s. With most, if not all, <span class="underline">nations wearing nuclear 'six-shooters' on their hips</span>, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of</span></span> dead cities or even <span class="underline"><strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">whole nations</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif;">, </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Japan’s interest in BMD dates to the mid-1980s, when several Japanese companies participated in the Pentagon’s WESTPAC project, a preliminary study of missile defense requirements in the Western Pacific. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The Japanese government got directly involved in BMD discussions</span></u> <u>in 1993, when an official Japan-U.S. TMD Working Group was created “to provide a forum for regular discussion of TMD.”2 Subsequently, U.S. corporations and defense <span style="background-color: yellow;">officials lobbied heavily for Japan to endorse</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">TMD</span> concept and pursue collaborative missile defense projects.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Some commentators criticized such back room lobbying because it preempted more robust public discussion regarding the wisdom of TMD for Japan. As one editorial in the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun argued</span><u>, “[A]mid the absence of government and public arguments, the actual situation is that the defense industry is jumping the gun…”3</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Toshiyuki Toyoda, a physicist at Meiji Gakun University, expressed </span><u>similar skepticism with the observation that “people who harbor a blind belief in technology may be easily deceived by the promoters of these expensive scheme</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s.”4 Such reservations did little to temper American zeal in promoting a Japanese TMD system. </span><u>At the second meeting of the <span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan-U.S. TMD Working Group</span> in 1995, U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) representatives <span style="background-color: yellow;">presented</span> Japanese <span style="background-color: yellow;">officials with</span> a 40-page document entitled “<span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan’s Choices Regarding TMD</span>.” <span style="background-color: yellow;">Strongly endorsing</span> several <span style="background-color: yellow;">Asian t</span>heater <span style="background-color: yellow;">m</span>issile <span style="background-color: yellow;">d</span>efense <span style="background-color: yellow;">options,</span> the report warned that TMD is “the last military business opportunity for this century.”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5 While visiting with a senior Japan Defense Agency (JDA) official, a former U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of Defense said on March 10, 1995 that “relations with the U.S. military, industry, and Congress will suffer if no progress is made in introducing the TMD.”6 </span><u>After release of the 1995 report, JDA officials questioned the feasibility of TMD and protested the language of BMDO’s presentation on the grounds that it “gives the impression that Japan has already committed itself to the TMD.”7 During the next few years, preliminary discussions continued, with <span style="background-color: yellow;">U.S. officials pushing for TMD and Japanese officials</span> largely soft-pedaling such proposals, until a dramatic event profoundly changed the valence of discussions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. On August 31, 1998, North Korea launched a prototype Taepodong three-stage missile over the Japanese archipelago. According to Yoichi Funabashi, chief diplomatic correspondent for the Asahi Shimbun, this dramatic test was the “direct impetus” </span><u>behind Japan’s decision to pursue TMD.8 As The Economist reported, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the North Korean launch provided the stimulus needed</span> to break the logjam on Japanese attitudes toward missile defense: “After years of dithering, the Japanese government promptly agreed to participate in America’s proposed Theatre Missile Defense system</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">…”9 There are early indications that the </span><u>Japan<span style="background-color: yellow;">-U.S. TMD project will focus on</span> Research and Development <span style="background-color: yellow;">(R&amp;D)</span> options for the Navy Theater Wide (NTW) missile defense system, with project costs running upwards of $524 million, and expenses split evenly by the two parties over five to six years. D</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">esigned to protect against incoming missiles flying within a 1,860-mile radius, NTW is categorized by the U.S. as a theater system, even though it would be designed to have strategic capability for Japan (i.e. to protect the entirety of its geographical land mass).10 </span><u>In the R&amp;D effort, U.S. <span style="background-color: yellow;">officials hope to gain from</span> Japanese <span style="background-color: yellow;">contributions in</span> the areas of miniaturization, sensors, propulsion, and cryogenics.11 Also, it is believed that Japan could help with development of <span style="background-color: yellow;">the NTW system</span>, by contributing technology and expertise enabling weight reduction of the Navy’s Standard Missile (used as the interceptor component of the new system), as well as refinement of multicolored imagers designed to enhance the ability of NTW sensors to discriminate between actual warheads and decoys.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Lighter interceptor missiles could improve NTW’s overall performance by enhancing interceptor range and maneuverability, while more powerful sensor imaging technology might increase the probability that interceptor missiles could locate and home in on target missiles. </span><u>One way to shed light on the possible course of public argument and scientific collaboration in the Japan-U.S. TMD project is to look to the past. The promotion campaign for this collaborative effort carries the imprints of advocacy schemes deployed to buoy the political fortunes of many missile defense</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">programs since 1983, when U.S. president Ronald Reagan put BMD on the front pages of the world’s newspapers with his famous “Star Wars address.” </span><u>As historian Frances FitzGerald points out, Reagan’s key motivation for advocating Star Wars was to fashion a rhetorical tool that would allow him to respond to the ominous dangers of the superpower arms race in a way that would appeal to the nuclear freeze constituency</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 12 After the speech, missile defense advocates seized upon Reagan’s claim that missile defense could render nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete” </span><u>by packaging the concept of BMD in the language of peace and disarmament. Remarkably, it appears that marching orders for this rhetorical strategy of co-option were laid out in a “Proposed Plan for Project on BMD and Arms Control” entitled “High Frontier: A New Option in Space</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” apparently produced by the Heritage Foundation late into President Reagan’s first term.13 According to former aerospace industry insider Carol Rosin, the objectives of this secret plan are to “get an early BMD underway and develop enough political support to ensure that it could not be turned off,” and to force a drastic reorientation of the U.S. arms control debate in such a way as to “make it politically risky for BMD opponents to invoke alleged ‘arms control arguments’ against an early, or any other BMD system.”14 Specifically, the “High Frontier” document instructs BMD advocates to “unambiguously seek to recapture the term ‘arms control’ and all of the idealistic images and language attached to this term.”15 In a section on “Tactics,” the report recommends a “radical approach that seeks to disarm BMD opponents, either by stealing their language and cause, ‘arms control,’ or by putting them into a tough political corner through their explicit or de facto advocacy of classical anti-population war crimes.” The report continues: “[T]o the extent possible, BMD proponents should begin to stress nuclear disarmament as a new end point, perhaps using such descriptions as arms control through BMD = nuclear disarmament.”16 The report also establishes a rhetorical foundation for strategic deception on the technical aspects of SDI, by suggesting that ethical arguments for BMD should be uncoupled from scientific concerns about technical feasibility; BMD “will be driven by ethical urgency, rather than by technological availability…”17 Examination of the official discourse supporting the Japan-U.S. TMD project reveals areas of overlap in the basic organizing themes </span><u>for the project and patterns of persuasion pursued in the early U.S. Star Wars promotion campaign. Discussing the joint Japan-U.S. TMD project, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen said, “Our interests are purely defensive.”18 <span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan’s Foreign Minister</span>, Masahiko Komura, <span style="background-color: yellow;">paralleled this rhetorical tack,</span> by telling the Diet that “the TMD will be purely defensive and will never pose any military threat to other countries.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”19 The East Asian Strategic Review, compiled by the National Institute for Defense Studies (</span><u>a research arm of the JDA) rebutted China’s criticisms of Japan-U.S. TMD collaboration, arguing that such research is “purely defensive.” <span style="background-color: yellow;">comments reflect TMD’s strong potential appeal in Japan</span>, where heightened threat perceptions stir calls for pro-active JDA measures, but where political and legal constraints rule out pursuit of deterrence based on a buildup of offensive weaponry. In this</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">climate, TMD seems to be a “delicious” rhetorical option for politicians and military leaders seeking to satisfy hawks and doves simultaneously. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Missile defense’s potential</span></u> <u>appeal <span style="background-color: yellow;">cuts across a broad spectrum of military</span> and public <span style="background-color: yellow;">opinion</span>. The argument that missile defense <span style="background-color: yellow;">can contribute to sec</span>urity through maintenance of technological superiority over adversaries resonates with hawks who endorse peace-through-strength logic, while missile defense’s <span style="background-color: yellow;">very name sounds reassuring</span> to some doves who favor defensive military postures and doctrines.</u> <u>Reflecting on the rhetorical potential of Japanese missile defense in this regard, one commentator notes that since “the missiles do not detonate and are intended for defense, adoption could be more politically palatable in a country that…has explicitly renounced war in its constitution</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”21 As an antiweapon weapon, missile defense can be lacquered in a veneer of anti-war rhetoric. The same rhetorical maneuver that President Reagan used to sell Star Wars as a </span><u>tool of disarmament to the U.S. freeze movement during the 1980s appears to have been appropriated by <span style="background-color: yellow;">Japanese BMD advocates seeking to reconcile missile defense</span> with their nation’s peace constitution in the contemporary milieu.</u><br />

<u>The fact that Japanese leaders have already shown a proclivity to extol TMD’s “purely defensive” qualities is evidence that <span style="background-color: yellow;">any American export of missile defense to Japan will likely include</span> not only technology, but also accompanying <span style="background-color: yellow;">rhetorical strategies designed to politically safeguard such hardware</span> in the crucible of public debate</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As discussed earlier, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">missile defense advocates</span></u> <u>used Reagan’s suggestion that Star Wars could render nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete” to <span style="background-color: yellow;">co-opt the rhetorical high ground occupied by the disarmament left</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Tests were rigged and scientific processes manipulated to buoy the political fortunes of the Star Wars, Patriot, THAAD, and NMD programs. Further, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">the actual purposes of the</span></u> <u>Timberwind and <span style="background-color: yellow;">NMD programs were covered up</span> in attempts <span style="background-color: yellow;">to hide politically unpopular aspects</span> of such initiatives. Perhaps these episodes of strategic deception in U.S. missile defense advocacy would be easier to excuse if they were conducted by “rogue” scientists who broke the law for profit or fame.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But CIA defense guidance documents, internal DOD directives, and presidential National Security Decision Directives reveal that during the Reagan Star Wars era, strategic deception was not only legally authorized, but also officially mandated, as part of the public relations campaign to promote missile defense.69 </span><u>Although Japanese leaders greeted American Star Wars-era missile defense overtures with skepticism, the 1998 launch of a Taepodong missile by North Korea over Japan galvanized political support for TMD in Japan and led eventually to the inking of the August 1999 MOU between Japan and the U.S.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Unfortunately, </span><u>the <span style="background-color: yellow;">same threatening environment that drives support for missile defense</span> also <span style="background-color: yellow;">provides rationales</span> for public officials <span style="background-color: yellow;">to ratchet up secrecy</span> and dodge public accountability, with the explanation that <span style="background-color: yellow;">full disclosure of the nature of TMD</span> plans and <span style="background-color: yellow;">their lack of scientific basis would give comfort to the enemy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, </span><u>this <span style="background-color: yellow;">preemption of public debate</span> i<span style="background-color: yellow;">ntroduces</span> its own set of <span style="background-color: yellow;">security concerns</span>.</u> <u>Excessive <span style="background-color: yellow;">secrecy locks in Cold War</span> patterns of public <span style="background-color: yellow;">discourse,</span> where defense officials and industry representatives monopolize arguments, sealing their positions with the unassailable proof of classified evidence</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Threat assessments drift toward worst-case scenarios generated from simulation and speculation, rather than more sober appraisals of foreign military capabilities and intentions. </span><u>Military <span style="background-color: yellow;">officials who see the idea of public debate as</span> a <span style="background-color: yellow;">superfluous</span> luxury <span style="background-color: yellow;">skirt critical arguments</span>, removing issues of grave national importance from arenas of democratic deliberation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>With these patterns of public argument structuring official missile defense discourse in the U.S. during the past two decades, American <span style="background-color: yellow;">citizens have been coaxed to spend billions</span> of dollars for doctored scientific experiments <span style="background-color: yellow;">that cover up the technical flaws of</span> ill-conceived <span style="background-color: yellow;">BMD initiatives</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The recent Japan-U.S. MOU on joint missile defense research clears the way for such strategies to be exported to Japanese public spheres. Export of these patterns of public argument to Japan could potentially produce tragic consequences. </span><u>Profit-hungry aerospace companies, working with government scientists well-schooled in the art of technical deception, could <span style="background-color: yellow;">swell political momentum for deployment of a TMD system</span> that appears flawless, yet is riddled with systemic deficiencies that may only come to light in combat situations.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This outcome my rockets in future conflicts, when in fact their level of vulnerability to missile strikes would be much greater than believed. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">could invite catastrophic miscalculations in Japanese foreign policy</span></u><u>.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Evangelista’s analysis of the influence exerted by transnational peace movement activists in the U.S. and Russia during the late 1980s provides one concrete illustration of how energetic dissent can loosen the grip of the Cold War language game. Using what Olson and Goodnight call “discursive oppositional arguments,” </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">American and Soviet anti-nuclear movements linked up to create</span>, in Rita Felski’s terminology, <span style="background-color: yellow;">a “counter-public sphere</span>” that rejected the self-reinforcing logic of what Herbert York calls an “<span style="background-color: yellow;">internal arms race.</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">78 Bernd W. Kubbig, of the Peace Research Institute at Frankfurt, Germany, notes that scientists and scholars critical of the arms race “</span><u>functioned as icebreakers during the Cold War,” working as an “epistemic community” with “an authoritative claim to policy-relevant knowledge</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”79 According to Evangelista, the successful efforts of transnational movement allies to shift the terms of public debate through “strategic use of norms, ideas, and information,” created conditions where the superpowers were coaxed to step back from the abyss of nuclear annihilation.80 </span><u>A similar opportunity presents itself today, with the Japan-U.S. TMD research project still in an embryonic stage. Recent official discourse on this project largely reflects Cold War themes and norms of argumentation. In Japan, Funabashi notes that so far, “<span style="background-color: yellow;">government responses to questions on TMD” have been “provided at only a cursory level,</span>” and that <span style="background-color: yellow;">the TMD issue “is something that has been discussed only within an extremely small circle of security professionals</span>— <span style="background-color: yellow;">the so-called</span> security high priests.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”81 However, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">peace movement advocates in Japan and the U.S. could use the TMD issue to galvanize transnational counter-public spheres, opening up spaces for perennially excluded and co-opted voices</span> to gain traction in public debates on security policy.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In such spaces, citizens from both nations could draw upon each other’s experience to shape the tenor and substance of public discourse. In this regard, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Americans sorting through the missile defense issue have much to learn from Japanese nuclear abolition advocate</span>s, whose passionate opposition to nuclear weaponry is informed by the direct experience of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. According to Joseph Gerson, of the American Friends Service Committee, the “spirit and commitment” of the Japanese hibakusha (nuclear war survivors) are inspiring examples of the “will and steadfastness necessary to force governments to disarm and to return the nuclear genie back to its bottle</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”82 As the only nation to have ever been subjected to nuclear attack, </span><u>Japan brings an important perspective to discussions of international security in a world bristling with weapons of mass destruction</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Such perspective can help refocus missile defense debates in constructive ways on both sides of the Pacifi</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">c. For example, as the recent report of the Tokyo Forum for Nuclear Non-Proliferation recommends, </span><u>whatever the outcome of pending missile defense deployment decisions, nuclear <span style="background-color: yellow;">disarmament should be the top priority in security policy:</span> “Missile defenses should not be seen as an alternative to the norm of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” 83 The report further suggests that it is especially important to maintain this emphasis on disarmament even in the event of affirmative BMD deployment decisions, through establishment of clear exit strategies that codify conditions under which missile defenses would be removed: “</span><u>Nations would be wise to leave open the possibility that defensive deployments could be scaled back, or even eliminated, if the sources of concern were reduced or removed</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”84 </span><u>In the other direction, Japanese citizens pondering the wisdom of spending billions of yen on American missile defense technology might reach more informed decisions by learning from the experience of American citizens, who have witnessed their government’s numerous</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(and largely futile) attempts to engineer an </span><u>effective missile shield</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> since 1944, when the U.S. Army initiated Project Thumper, the nation’s first BMD program. The </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">history of U.S. missile defense is a trail littered with false promises, dashed expectations, and fraudulent science</span>. Americans could do a service to their Japanese counterparts by sharing the details of this history, thereby putting missile defense advocates’ shopworn claim that effective defense is “just around the corner” in proper perspective</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To the extent that </span><u>reciprocal dialogue of this sort carves out deliberative spaces for citizens to participate more critically in public debates over missile defense, it has potential to challenge the hegemonic status of technocratic thinking as the basis of security polic</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">y. As security studies scholar Simon Dalby explains, the Cold War produced security discourses that “act to reduce the role of political discussion by recasting political issues in terms of technical problems.” </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Such discourses “depoliticize issues by involving technical expertise in the place of political decision-making.”</span>85 Today’s arguments for missile defense reflect this Cold War pattern of reasoning, with advocates prescribing the technical solution of defensive weapons as an elixir for the political problem of WMD proliferation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this context, </span><u>can dialogue and diplomacy really compete with the rhetorically delicious appeal of the missile defense tech-fix?</u> <u>The answer to this question hinges in large part on the efforts of scientists, scholars, and citizens to develop concrete security frameworks that provide credible alternatives to the technocratic model.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> One promising initiative in this regard is the “Diplomacy First!” proposal recently announced by the Union of German Scientists (VDW). </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">This proposal is remarkable for the way it indicts American calls for NMD and TMD by developing detailed alternatives for dealing politically with the problem of WMD proliferation.</span> Such alternatives are founded on a “policy of prevention” that seeks to control the spread of arms through means of “institutionalized dialogue.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”86 Kubbig’s Modernized, Mutually Minimizing Missile Threat Concept (“Quadruple M-TC”) represents one concrete expression of this strategy for achieving post-Cold War security through diplomacy, rather than technological dominance. </span><u>Kubbig’s security blueprint may be of particular interest to Japanese officials and citizens, since it draws from recent successes in the North Korean case to illustrate the effectiveness of a “Diplomacy First!” approa</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ch</span><u>. Contemporary missile defense discussions are freighted with weighty subtexts that often fail to surface in technically oriented debates conducted in official spheres of deliberation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One such subtext can be cast as a question of governance.87 </span><u>Should hard choices on nuclear weapons policy be left to the security “high priests,”88 who generally make decisions based on secret data churned through recycled Cold War models? If not, is the vision of a post-Cold War democracy dividend on security policy a workable alternative worth pursuing? These questions signal that missile defense deployment decisions not only present important choices regarding military strategy; as moments of collective judgment, they can also be seen as virtual referenda on the relative merits of technocratic versus democratic forms of governance.</u><br />

<span class="Underline">Despite its avowed pacifist security policy, Japan has cooperated with the United States on missile defense since the 1980s. Some in Japan would like to alter the country's laws further to allow for an even stronger missile defense cooperative with the United States. Naturally, China is watching this alliance carefully, warning that it could lead to regional instability and a renewed arms race in East Asia. Japanese security policy is at a crossroads, shifting from a traditional pacifist security policy to a more assertive security policy. As part of this shift, Tokyo is steadily moving toward the deployment of a more robust missile defense system, which the Japanese government doesn't think contradicts the country's &quot;exclusively defensive defense&quot; policy anyway. And while the debate about U.S. missile defense installations in Eastern Europe remains contentious, in East Asia, political debate about missile defense installations in Japan seems to be fading away. Under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, U.S.-Japanese security ties were enhanced post-9/11. His friendship with President George W. Bush also augmented the two countries' bond. As such, it was under Koizumi that Japan officially decided to deploy missile defense in collaboration with the United States. In fact, Koizumi made missile defense a cornerstone of the country's security policy. He wasn't alone in this thinking; many Japanese government officials perceive missile defense as a more realistic option in responding to regional threats such as North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. In addition, Japan's 2004 National Defense Guidelines, for the first time, stated concerns over China's military modernization. History of missile defense in Japan U.S.-Japanese cooperation on missile defense dates back to the 1980s and the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). At that time, Japan's participation in SDI was merely symbolic of U.S.-Japanese security cooperation and helpful to mitigate economic and trade disputes with Washington. This changed in August 1998 when North Korea tested its Taepodong-1 ballistic missile. Even for the Japanese people, who are generally considered pacifists post-World War II, the Taepodong-1 flying over their heads was an alarming wake-up call. Immediately afterward, Tokyo joined Washington in cooperative research and development of a ballistic missile defense system. On the basis of seemingly positive results of missile defense tests and the U.S. decision to deploy an initial national missile defense capability in December 2002, the Japanese government determined that ballistic missile defense had high technological feasibility. In addition, the revelation that North Korea had continued its work on nuclear weapons development and Pyongyang's subsequent withdrawal from the NPT in 2003 convinced Tokyo to officially acquire a ballistic missile defense capability. Thus, on December 19, 2003, it issued the cabinet decision &quot;On Introduction of Ballistic Missile Defense System and Other Measure.&quot; Ever since, establishing a robust missile defense system has been a top national security priority. To implement its new agenda, Tokyo altered its National Defense Program Guidelines in 2005 to indicate that the country's Three Principles on Arms Export and related provisions could be modified as necessary for the deployment of ballistic missile defense. The &quot;Three Principles,&quot; a hallmark of Japan's pacifism policy, long barred Tokyo from jointly developing and producing weapons or transferring weapon parts to foreign countries, including the United States. Tokyo's surprisingly determined and quick adoption of these decisions in order to be ready for the actual deployment of ballistic missile defense seem to be influenced by North Korea's actions. In particular, since North Korea's July 2006 missile launches, which ended its 1999 missile test moratorium, and Pyongyang's October 2006 nuclear test, Tokyo has accelerated its missile defense deployment. Japan's current missile defense capabilities As of January, Tokyo has deployed a multilayered missile defense system that consists of sea-based midcourse missile defense (the Aegis ballistic missile defense system); and ground-based terminal phase missile defense (Patriot Advanced Capabilities-3, or PAC-3). With the accelerated process, a PAC-3 installment in the Tokyo Metropolitan area has been completed. By March 2011, PAC-3 missiles will be deployed at 16 fire units around Japan's major cities. The Aegis system features a three-stage missile (SM-3) with a range of 1,000 kilometers designed to intercept a short- to intermediate-range ballistic missile in outer space. At its first flight test in December 2007, the SM-3 launched from Kongo, a Japanese Aegis ship, and detected, tracked, and destroyed a mock missile that resembled North Korea's Nodong outside the atmosphere at an altitude of approximately 100 miles. With its mission accomplished, Kongo was deployed at Japan's Air Self Defense Force (MSDF) Sasebo base in Nagasaki on January 4, 2008. As the first country other than the United States to succeed in intercepting a mock missile with the Aegis system, Japan might have been overconfident in its technical feasibility. Moreover, at its first test-firing of the PAC-3 interceptor, MSDF successfully shot down a mock ballistic missile at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico last September. This sequence of successful tests might have brought somewhat more optimistic prospects to Japan's defense ministry. Therefore, the failure of a second Aegis test in November significantly disappointed both U.S. and Japanese missile defense proponents. While officials said the failure won't affect the program's future--The Ministry of Defense plans to deploy four Aegis-equipped destroyers by March 2011--some setbacks will be unavoidable. Impediments to missile defense in Japan &quot;Basic Space Law.&quot; Japan's long-standing, self-imposed restriction on the military use of space has impeded it from enhancing its missile defense capabilities. However, in August 27, a new law, the &quot;Basic Space Law,&quot; entered into force, lifting the ban on Tokyo's use of space for defensive purposes. Thirty years earlier, when Japan's Space Agency was established, the Diet unanimously adopted a resolution committing the country only to using space for peaceful purposes, which has been interpreted as non-military. The Basic Space Law changed that interpretation to nonaggressive, meaning the MSDF now can manufacture, possess, and operate its own satellites to support military operations such as ballistic missile defense. Thus, the MSDF plans to procure reconnaissance satellites, early warning satellites, and tracking and communications satellites--all areas in which Japan had been relying on the United States. (See &quot;Japan Enters New Space Age.&quot;) For instance, it was the U.S. Defense Support Program satellites that detected the North Korean missile launches in July 2006. The Japanese Constitution. Under the current Japanese government's interpretation of Article 9 of its Constitution, Japan's participation in collective self-defense is prohibited, as is using missile defense capabilities to defend a third country--even an ally such as the United States. Therefore, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a strong advocate of changing Article 9, formed the Council on Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security in April 2007 to provide recommendations on the right of collective self-defense. &quot;Whether it is appropriate for Japan to use its missile defense to intercept ballistic missiles targeting the United States&quot; was one of four scenarios he tasked the council to answer. The council was supposed to submit recommendations to the Cabinet by September 2007, but after the devastating defeat of Abe's ruling party in the upper house election in July 2007 and his abrupt resignation two months later, the council's members delayed making their recommendations. Abe's successor, Yasuo Fukuda, wasn't as enthusiastic about changing the constitutional interpretation. So even though the council submitted its recommendations stating that Japan should have the right to exercise collective self-defense last June, nothing has changed. Taro Aso, the country's third prime minister in two years, is more supportive of the right to collective self-defense, which might revitalize debate over the issue. Technologically, Japan currently doesn't have the capability to shoot down a missile heading toward the United States even if it legally could. But the two countries are currently developing SM-3 Block II A missiles that could potentially intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles. (See &quot;Japan Test Fires Its First Raytheon-Built Standard Missile-3.&quot;) As technological capabilities improve to intercept long-range ballistic missiles, the argument that Japan isn't allowed by its constitutional interpretation to shoot down a missile heading toward the United States might be perceived as unacceptable. Technical limitations. Although both the Japanese and U.S. governments have highlighted successful flight tests, all flight intercept tests have been conducted under highly structured conditions with information about the missile attack. In a real missile launch, it's highly unlikely that the launch location, timing of launch, and flight trajectories will be known, making it almost impossible to predict the percentage of success of an intercept in a real-world attack. (See &quot;Technical Realities: National Missile Defense Deployment in 2004.&quot;) The Japanese people. The socio-cultural reticence in Japan to any military engagement hasn't made the country's populace fully tolerant of missile defense. Nevertheless, the recent threats from North Korea have dimmed opposition. A 2006 public opinion poll conducted by the Cabinet Office indicated that 56.6 percent of respondents supported missile defense; similarly, a Yomiuri-Gallup public opinion poll [in Japanese] conducted in December 2006 showed that 60 percent of respondents supported it. For those against it, cost seems to be a primary reason why. According to the Ministry of Defense, the missile defense program is estimated to cost Japan $7.4 billion to $8.9 billion through 2012. And since Tokyo plans to pursue still more advanced technologies, costs are likely to increase. China's response Regionally, China has been disturbed by the accelerated progress of the U.S.-Japanese missile defense cooperative. Specifically, China is worried that U.S.-Japanese missile defense could thwart Beijing's limited nuclear deterrent, encourage Japanese militarization, protect Taiwan, and trigger a regional arms race. Chinese opposition to the U.S.-Japan missile defense cooperation isn't as vehement as that of Russia to the U.S. missile defense deployment in Eastern Europe, but if China perceives that the missile shield will shift the balance of power in the region, its opposition will intensify. Future prospects for missile defense in Japan The current security environment in East Asia and the Bush administration's interest in missile defense have helped bring the U.S.-Japanese missile defensive cooperative to where it stands today. That said, President-elect Barack Obama has a different view on missile defense; moreover, he has repeatedly stated that strengthening the nonproliferation regime should be a priority. Thus, it's likely that changes in U.S. security priority will alter Japanese missile defense plans somewhat. Nonetheless, Japan's already scheduled system deployment date of 2011 probably will be met. More generally, a robust Japanese missile defense capability isn't conducive to sustainable peace in East Asia. That's why it's particularly important that Japan and the United States avoid building a structure that looks confrontational to China, which would obviously decrease stability in the region. Therefore, President-elect Obama should shift U.S.-Japanese security cooperation to matters of arms control and nonproliferation while inviting other countries in the region such as China to join in this endeavor. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Pan 4 [Chengxin, is Lecturer in International Relations at Deakin University, Australia; The &quot;China Threat&quot; in American Self-Imagination: The Discursive Construction of Other as Power Politics Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, Vol. 29, 2004. /HN] </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Certainly, I do not deny China's potential for strategic misbehavior in the global context, nor do I claim the &quot;essential peacefulness&quot; of Chinese culture. (40) Having said that, my main point here is that there is no such thing as &quot;Chinese reality&quot; that can automatically speak for itself, for example, as a &quot;threat.&quot; Rather, the &quot;China threat&quot; is essentially a specifically social meaning given to China by its U.S. observers, a meaning that cannot be disconnected from the dominant U.S. self-construction. Thus, to fully understand the U.S. &quot;China threat&quot; argument, it is essential to recognize its autobiographical nature. Indeed, the construction of other is not only a product of U.S. self-imagination, but often a necessary foil to it. For example, by taking this particular representation of China as Chinese reality per se, those scholars are able to assert their self-identity as &quot;mature,&quot; &quot;rational&quot; realists capable of knowing the &quot;hard facts&quot; of international politics, in distinction from those &quot;idealists&quot; whose views are said to be grounded more in &quot;an article of faith&quot; than in &quot;historical experience.&quot; (41) On the other hand, given that history is apparently not &quot;progressively&quot; linear, the invocation of a certain other not only helps explain away such historical uncertainties or &quot;anomalies&quot; and maintain the credibility of the allegedly universal path trodden by the United States, but also serves to highlight U.S. &quot;indispensability.&quot; As Samuel Huntington puts it, &quot;If being an American means being committed to the principles of liberty, democracy, individualism, and private property, and if there is no evil empire out there threatening those principles, what indeed does it mean to be an American, and what becomes of American national interests?&quot; (42) In this way, it seems that the constructions of the particular U.S. self and its other are always intertwined and mutually reinforcing. Some may suggest that there is nothing particularly wrong with this since psychologists generally agree that &quot;individuals and groups define their identity by differentiating themselves from and placing themselves in opposition to others.&quot; (43) This is perhaps true. As the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure tells us, meaning itself depends on difference and differentiation. (44) Yet, to understand the U.S. dichotomized constructions of self/other in this light is to normalize them and render them unproblematic, because it is also apparent that not all identity-defining practices necessarily perceive others in terms of either universal sameness or absolute otherness and that difference need not equate to threat. The Discursive Construction of China as Other in the &quot;China Threat&quot; Literature Having examined how the &quot;China threat&quot; literature is enabled by and serves the purpose of a particular U.S. self-construction, I want to turn now to the issue of how this literature represents a discursive construction of other, instead of an &quot;objective&quot; account of Chinese reality. This, I argue, has less to do with its portrayal of China as a threat per se than with its essentialization and totalization of China as an externally knowable object, independent of historically contingent contexts or dynamic international interactions. In this sense, the discursive construction of China as a threatening other cannot be detached from (neo)realism, a positivist, ahistorical framework of analysis within which global life is reduced to endless interstate rivalry for power and survival. As many critical IR scholars have noted, (neo)realism is not a transcendent description of global reality but is predicated on the modernist Western identity, which, in the quest for scientific certainty, has come to define itself essentially as the sovereign territorial nation-state. This realist self-identity of Western states leads to the constitution of anarchy as the sphere of insecurity, disorder, and war. In an anarchical system, as (neo)realists argue, &quot;the gain of one side is often considered to be the loss of the other,&quot; (45) and &quot;All other states are potential threats.&quot; (46) In order to survive in such a system, states inevitably pursue power or capability. In doing so, these realist claims represent what R. B. J. Walker calls &quot;a specific historical articulation of relations of universality/particularity and self/Other.&quot; (47) The (neo)realist paradigm has dominated the U.S. IR discipline in general and the U.S. China studies field in particular. As Kurt Campbell notes, after the end of the Cold War, a whole new crop of China experts &quot;are much more likely to have a background in strategic studies or international relations than China itself.&quot; (48) As a result, for those experts to know China is nothing more or less than to undertake a geopolitical analysis of it, often by asking only a few questions such as how China will &quot;behave&quot; in a strategic sense and how it may affect the regional or global balance of power, with a particular emphasis on China's military power or capabilities. As Thomas J. Christensen notes, &quot;Although many have focused on intentions as well as capabilities, the most prevalent component of the [China threat] debate is the assessment of China's overall future military power compared with that of the United States and other East Asian regional powers.&quot; (49) Consequently, almost by default, China emerges as an absolute other and a threat thanks to this (neo)realist prism. The (neo)realist emphasis on survival and security in international relations dovetails perfectly with the U.S. self-imagination, because for the United States to define itself as the indispensable nation in a world of anarchy is often to demand absolute security. As James Chace and Caleb Carr note, &quot;for over two centuries the aspiration toward an eventual condition of absolute security has been viewed as central to an effective American foreign policy.&quot; (50) And this self-identification in turn leads to the definition of not only &quot;tangible&quot; foreign powers but global contingency and uncertainty per se as threats. For example, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush repeatedly said that &quot;the enemy [of America] is unpredictability. The enemy is instability.&quot; (51) Similarly, arguing for the continuation of U.S. Cold War alliances, a high-ranking Pentagon official asked, &quot;if we pull out, who knows what nervousness will result?&quot; (52) Thus understood, by its very uncertain character, China would now automatically constitute a threat to the United States. For example, Bernstein and Munro believe that &quot;China's political unpredictability, the always-present possibility that it will fall into a state of domestic disunion and factional fighting,&quot; constitutes a source of danger. (53) In like manner, Richard Betts and Thomas Christensen write: If the PLA [People's Liberation Army] remains second-rate, should the world breathe a sigh of relief? Not entirely.... Drawing China into the web of global interdependence may do more to encourage peace than war, but it cannot guarantee that the pursuit of heartfelt political interests will be blocked by a fear of economic consequences.... U.S. efforts to create a stable balance across the Taiwan Strait might deter the use of force under certain circumstances, but certainly not all. (54) The upshot, therefore, is that since China displays no absolute certainty for peace, it must be, by definition, an uncertainty, and hence, a threat. In the same way, a multitude of other unpredictable factors (such as ethnic rivalry, local insurgencies, overpopulation, drug trafficking, environmental degradation, rogue states, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and international terrorism) have also been labeled as &quot;threats&quot; to U.S. security. Yet, it seems that in the post-Cold War environment, China represents a kind of uncertainty par excellence. &quot;Whatever the prospects for a more peaceful, more democratic, and more just world order, nothing seems more uncertain today than the future of post-Deng China,&quot; (55) argues Samuel Kim. And such an archetypical uncertainty is crucial to the enterprise of U.S. self-construction, because it seems that only an uncertainty with potentially global consequences such as China could justify U.S. indispensability or its continued world dominance. In this sense, Bruce Cumings aptly suggested in 1996 that China (as a threat) was basically &quot;a metaphor for an enormously expensive Pentagon that has lost its bearings and that requires a formidable 'renegade state' to define its mission (Islam is rather vague, and Iran lacks necessary weights).&quot; (56) </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Current Chinese Nuclear Policy It can be safely said that of all the nuclear states, the nuclear policy of China has so far been the most consistent. From the day China first exploded an atomic bomb, its nuclear policy-related statements have remained unchanged. Five major components can be derived from these statements: No First Use Policy No first use (NFU) has been most frequently and consistently repeated in numerous Chinese government statements ever since China became a nuclear weapon state in 1964. By conceding the first use option, China has limited itself to retaliatory nuclear use only. China has also called all nuclear weapon states to commit themselves to a NFU policy at any time and in any circumstances. Security Assurance to Non Nuclear Weapons States and Nuclear Free Zones China has been very critical of the use of nuclear threats against non-nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapons zones. It has repeatedly called on all the nuclear weapon states to agree to a legally-binding, multilateral agreement under which they would pledge not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states and nuclear free zones. This policy component limits China’s potential nuclear adversaries to just the few nuclear weapon states. Apart from the negative security assurance, which China gives unconditionally to all non-nuclear weapon states, China issued its first formal positive security assurance with the other four declared nuclear weapon states in April 1995, promising to come to the aid of any non-nuclear weapon state subject to nuclear attack and pursue appropriate punishment against the attacking state, under the auspices of the UN Security Council. This policy has become part of the UN Security Council Resolution 984. Limited Development of Second Strike, Retaliatory Capability China has repeated its intention to maintain a very small nuclear arsenal on many occasions. In its 2003 Defense White Paper, China states that it “has always exercised utmost restraint on the development of nuclear weapons, and its nuclear arsenal is kept at the lowest level necessary for self-defense only.”[1] However, to make this small arsenal a credible deterrent, China has to make it survivable to a first nuclear strike, even that strike is overwhelming and devastating. In Chinese literature, “few but effective” (jinggan youxiao) are the words most frequently used to describe its necessary arsenal. Opposition to Nuclear Deployment outside National Territories China is opposed to the policy of extended nuclear deterrence, or the policy of providing &quot;nuclear umbrellas&quot; by nuclear weapon states to their allies. In consistence with China’s long standing policy of not sending or stationing any troops outside China, it is also officially opposed to the deployment of nuclear weapons outside national territories, and has stated that China will never deployed nuclear weapons on any foreign soil. Complete Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and Thorough Nuclear Disarmament China first called for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons in its proposal for a world summit in1963, before its first nuclear explosion. On the same day of China’s first nuclear explosion, it again stated that “the Chinese government hereby solemnly proposes to the governments of the world that a summit conference of all the countries of the world be convened to discuss the questions of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and that as the first step, the summit conference conclude an agreement to the effect that the nuclear powers and those countries which may soon become nuclear powers undertake not to use nuclear weapons either against non-nuclear countries and nuclear-free zones or against each other.&quot;[2] This has evolved into China’s basic position on nuclear disarmament and it has never given up its efforts to promote an international convention to ban nuclear weapons. The above major components of Chinese nuclear policy, if interpreted through the lens of Western deterrence terminology, can be characterized as: Strategic Rather than Operational and Tactical Deterrence Mao Zedong, in elaborating China's reason to develop nuclear weapons, said “we will not only have possession of more aircraft and artillery pieces, but also atom bombs. In today’s world, we must have this thing if we don’t want to be bullied by others.”[3] The original purpose of nuclear development in China was to “break up the nuclear threat and smash the nuclear blackmail (dabuo he weixie, fensui he ezha).” As a political instrument, nuclear weapons are to be utilized mainly at the level of grand strategy, not as a winning tool in military operations. The military value of nuclear weapons lies only in its deterrent effect against nuclear attack. The officially declared missions of the Second Artillery Force are twofold: To deter the use of nuclear weapons against China, and To launch an effective nuclear counter-attack in the case of such an attack.[4] No distinction has been made in categorizing nuclear operations. A nuclear strike against China—whether conducted at strategic, operational or tactical level, with high or low yield warheads, or deadly or tolerable lethality—is perceived as the utmost form of warfare in Chinese war categorization, which must be responded strategically. In Chinese strategic literature, we only see the discussion on how to deter a nuclear war from happening, on how to prevent a conventional conflict from escalating into a nuclear war, and how to retaliate after suffering a nuclear attack—but never how to win a nuclear war. The primary Chinese perception is that nuclear wars are not to be won, but to be prevented. Retaliatory—Rather than Denial—Deterrence[5] Many Chinese cite Deng Xiaoping when explaining China's nuclear thinking. He explained, in a meeting with foreigners in 1983: &quot;While you have some deterrence force, we also have some; but we don't want much. It will do just to possess it. Things like strategic weapons and deterrence forces are there to scare others. They must not be used first. But our possession will have some effect. The limited possession of nuclear weapons itself exert some pressure. It remains our position that we will develop a little (nuclear weapons). But the development will be limited. We have said repeatedly that our small amount (of nuclear weapons) is nothing. It is only to show that we also have what you have. If you want to destroy us, you yourself have to suffer some punishment at the same time.&quot;[6] Deng’s statement echoed Mao’s nuclear thinking in several aspects: Nuclear weapons are desirable only for its deterrent value, not for battlefield utility. Nuclear weapons, if ever used, will be used to cause the enemy as much pain as possible, so as to enhance its deterrent value in the first place. Therefore, China has to adopt counter-value as opposed to counterforce targeting strategies, in order to strengthen its deterrence posture. Only a small number of nuclear weapons will satisfy China’s deterrent needs—to convince potential nuclear adversary of a possible nuclear retaliation. Both Mao and Deng are very explicit that the deterrent effectiveness does not increase in proportion with numbers of nuclear weapons. A survivable and invulnerable small arsenal can be equally effective in terms of deterrence. Deterrence effect depends on invulnerability to nuclear strikes, not on large amount of nuclear attack capabilities. Accordingly, what China has been seeking is a nuclear arsenal that is small in size but good in quality. As confined by its adherence to NFU policy, China has to focus its nuclear development efforts on “second strike capabilities” which must be credible and survivable in order to have deterrent effect. Central Rather than Extended Deterrence[7] By declaring to counter-attack with nuclear weapons only after being attacked by nuclear weapons, China has preserved nuclear capabilities to protect its own most vital interests—that is, the existence of the nation. Even during the Cold War years, China has never provided nuclear umbrella to any other country in the world. For China, the concept of extended deterrence has simply not entered into it nuclear calculus—yet. General Rather than Immediate Deterrence The mutual deterrence exercised by the two nuclear superpowers during the Cold War had been directed at one another. They were both 69the ones to deter, and the ones to be deterred. They formed a bilateral deterrent relationship, in which each side was very clear whom it wanted to deter, and what it wanted to deter them from. Their deterrence was more of an immediate nature. China had never comfortably fitted into the bipolar context. It had been in one of the poles for some time, then outside of both poles for some time, and then it tried to be closer to the other pole. In addition, China had not had the luxury of a nuclear umbrella for most of the Cold War years. Therefore, China’s nuclear deterrence had been more of a general nature—in which China tried to form a multilateral deterrent relationship with all the nuclear powers, which only made clear what China wanted to deter. Defensive Rather than Offensive Deterrence One famous tenet laid down by Chairman Mao Zedong is the Sixteen Character Guideline for the use of force—“We will never attack unless we are attacked; and if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack” (ren bu fan wo, wo bu fan ren; ren ruo fan wo, wo bi fan ren). Behind this guideline is a sober headed analysis of power balances. The PLA and its predecessors entered and won most wars as an inferior side against great odds. So a defensive posture had always been preferred to an offensive one. However, Chinese forces have managed to turn from being the weaker into the stronger party in the course—usually a protracted course—of previous conventional wars. When applied to nuclear policy, this Guideline simply means a rejection of preemptive thinking. The renunciation of the first-use option, the willingness to accept vulnerability, the confinement to retaliatory nuclear use, the principle of attacking only after being attacked (hou fa zi ren), the focus on second strike capabilities, and the reservation of nuclear means as the last resort to protect only the most vital national interests, all point to the defensiveness of China’s nuclear policy. Although nuclear weapons are inherently offensive weapons, when deterrence strategies are applied in the way China does, they acquire a pure defensive posture. Minimum Rather than Limited or Maximum Deterrence If I am to choose from Western deterrence classifications to describe Chinese nuclear deterrence posture in general, I would have to use the handy concept of “minimum deterrence” as compared to maximum or limited deterrence. Personally, I think the word “minimum” has too strong a quantitative connotation that is misleading. It sometimes suggests a quantitative standard instead of a qualitative standard. The word “minimum” has for some time been officially used in Chinese government documents.[8] But what I want to emphasize is that Chinese strategists take the concept as a relative one, defined not only by pure numbers, but more importantly by such key criteria as invulnerability of nuclear forces, assurance of retaliation, and credibility of counter-attack. When a Chinese document says that China intends to possess nuclear weapons only at the minimum (or lowest) level for the needs of self-defense, that means to have the minimum but assured capabilities for a retaliatory second strike. Some studies have suggested a shift of Chinese nuclear posture toward limited deterrence, where China could employ nuclear weapons to deter both conventional and nuclear wars, and even to exercise escalation control in the event of a conventional confrontation.[9] However, the basic logic of China’s nuclear thinking dictates nuclear weapons as deterring—not as a means of winning against nuclear weapons. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">This is not to imply that the kind of perspectives outlined above will automatically be translated into actual China policy, but one does not have to be exceedingly perceptive to note that the &quot;China threat&quot; perspective does exert enormous influence on U.S. policy making on China. To illustrate this point, I want now to examine some specific implications of U.S. representations of the &quot;China threat&quot; for U.S.-China relations in relation to the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis and the &quot;spy plane&quot; incident of 2001. Theory as Practice 1: The Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis In the eyes of many U.S. China watchers, China's approach to the Taiwan question is a microcosm of its grand strategy to dominate Asia. The argument is that nowhere is the threatening ambition more palpable than in China's saber-rattling missile tests near Taiwan's coast in 1995-1996, in addition to its long-standing refusal to renounce the use of force as a last resort to settle the dispute. (72) While the 1995-1996 missile crisis has been a favorite &quot;starting point&quot; for many pundits and practitioners to paint a frightening picture of China and to justify U.S. firm response to it, what is often conveniently overlooked is the question of how the &quot;China threat&quot; discourse itself had played a constitutive role in the lead-up to that crisis. Limits of space forbid exploring this complex issue here. Simply put, the Taiwan question was created largely as a result of widespread U.S. perceptions of China as a &quot;Red Menace&quot; in the wake of the &quot;loss of China&quot; and the outbreak of the Korean War. To thwart what it saw as an orchestrated Communist offensive in Asia, the United States deployed the U.S. Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait as part of its Cold War containment strategy, thereby effectively preventing the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. While the United States abandoned its containment and isolation policy toward China in the 1970s and the two countries established full diplomatic relations in 1979, the conventional image of the &quot;Red Menace&quot; lingered on in the United States. To manage such a &quot;threat,&quot; the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act shortly after the normalization of U.S.-China relations, renewing U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense even though diplomatic ties with the island had been severed. (73) This confrontational policy serves not only to shore up Taiwan's defense capabilities but also to induce its independent ambition and further complicate cross-strait relations. As former U.S. defense official Chas Freeman remarked, &quot;U.S. arms sales to Taiwan no longer work to boost Taipei's confidence that it can work out its differences with Beijing. Instead, they bolster the view that Taiwan can go its own way.&quot; (74) For instance, amid growing sympathy from the Republican-dominated Congress and the elite media as well as the expanded ties with the United States, Taiwan responded coolly to Beijing's call for dialogue in January 1995. In June 1995, Taiwan's flexible diplomacy, designed to burnish its independent image, culminated in its president Lee Teng-hui's high-profile visit to the United States. This in turn reinforced Beijing's suspicion that the real U.S. intention was to frustrate its reunification goal, leaving it apparently no other choice but to prepare militarily for what it saw as a worst-case scenario. All this constituted the major context in which the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait missile exercises took place. For most Chinese, the carrying out of these military exercises, well within their own territory, had little to do with attacking Taiwan, much less with challenging U.S. security interests in the western Pacific, Rather, it was about China's long-cherished dream of national unity, with its &quot;sabre rattling&quot; tactics serving merely as a warning to the United States, as well as to Taiwan. However, interpreting such exercises as China's muscle-flexing with direct security implications for the region, with &quot;an almost 19th-century display of gunboat diplomacy,&quot; (75) the United States dispatched two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers to the region of Taiwan. While not denying the potential security repercussions of China's missile tests for the region, I suggest that the flashpoint of Taiwan says as much about the danger of this U.S. approach to China as about the threat of Beijing's display of force itself. &quot;Had Bill Clinton projected a constancy of purpose and vision in China policy ... in 1993-1994,&quot; David M. Lampton argues, &quot;he might not have been challenged in the Taiwan Strait in 1995-1996 with missile exercises.&quot; (76) Indeed, it was primarily in the context of this U.S. intervention that Zhongguo keyi shuo bu (China can say no), one of the most anti-U.S. books ever produced in China, emerged and quickly became a best-seller in the Chinese reading world. (77) Mean-while, some Chinese strategic thinkers were so alarmed by the U.S. show of strength that they told Helmut Sonnenfeldt, one of Henry Kissinger's close associates, that they were rereading the early works of George F. Kennan because &quot;containment had been the basis of American policy toward the Soviet Union; now that the United States was turning containment against China, they wanted to learn how it had started and evolved.&quot; (78) If such a scary interaction between the United States and China remained somehow obscured here, it would soon be manifested again in another standoff in U.S.-China relations; namely, the spy-plane incident of 2001. Theory as Practice 2: The 2001 Spy-Plane Incident Following the 1995-1996 missile crisis, mainstream China observers have continued to take the Taiwan question as a purely geopolitical or security issue, which accordingly should be understood and dealt with simply from the time-honored balance-of-power, zero-sum game perspectives. For example, Bernstein and Munro insist that Taiwan's reunification with the mainland &quot;will leave China in possession of yet another immense economic prize.... Complete Chinese reunification, in other words, would further upset the balance of power and vastly enhance China's economic and strategic strength.&quot; (79) Commenting on this typical way of representing the Taiwan question, the Taiwan-based scholar Chih-yu Shih suggests that the national security analysis may seem to be a more tangible approach to dissecting the rationale behind Beijing's &quot;policy of coercion&quot; and, because it appears sensible to us, can alleviate our need to pursue Beijing's motivations more deeply. Not only can we thus camouflage our embarrassment at not really knowing China, but also Beijing's discomforting behavioural patterns become comfortably familiar. (80) Clearly, the practical implications of this kind of representation go far beyond that. After perceiving a power imbalance in the Taiwan Strait in favor of China, James Lilley (former U.S. ambassador to China) and Carl Ford proposed: &quot;The name of the game for Taiwan, then, is deterrence,&quot; which means that the United States must help Taiwan's military maintain &quot;a qualitative edge over the PRC.&quot; (81) The 2002 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Security Review Commission reached similar conclusions, recommending, among other things, &quot;deterring China attacking Taiwan&quot; and &quot;supporting Taiwan's ability to defend itself without outside assistance.&quot; In its formal conclusion, the review commission, made up of well-known U.S. China experts as well as influential policymakers, vows to continue monitoring China in every aspect relating to &quot;our national security concerns.&quot; (82) In fact, U.S. monitoring activity, such as conducting reconnaissance flights along Chinese borders, had always been part of its China policy. So went the rationale: The Chinese say they have the right to use force to reclaim Taiwan because it belongs to them, and they regularly practice for an invasion. This threat of force is why on April 1st [2001], the U.S. Navy's EP-3 surveillance plane was in the area to monitor China's military preparations. (83) Yet it turned out that the EP-3 spy plane collided with a Chinese navy fighter jet that was tailing it over the South China Sea, some fifty miles from the coast of China's Hainan Province. The Chinese jet crashed into the waters below, while the crippled spy plane landed on Hainan island. Washington demanded immediate return of its crew and plane, while Beijing insisted that the United States bear the responsibility for the midair collision and apologize for the incident. Rather than reflecting on how their new containment policy might have contributed to this incident in the first place, many U.S. realist analysts hastily interpreted it as further objective proof of the long-suspected &quot;China threat.&quot; As Allen S. Whiting put it, the collision &quot;focused attention anew on Beijing's willingness to risk the use of force in pursuit of political objectives.&quot; (84) It was as if the whole incident had little to do with U.S. spying, which was seen as &quot;routine&quot; and &quot;normal.&quot; Instead, it was the Chinese who were said to be &quot;playing a dangerous game,&quot; without regard to the old spy etiquette formulated during the Cold War. (85) For other observers, China's otherness was embodied also in its demand for a U.S. apology. For example, Merle Goldman, a history professor at Boston University, said that the Chinese emphasis on apologies was rooted in the Confucian value system: &quot;This kind of internalized consensus was the way China was ruled for thousands of years.&quot; (86) From this perspective, China's request for an apology was preordained by a fixed Chinese tradition and national psyche and had nothing whatsoever to do with the specific context of this incident in which China was spied on, its sovereignty violated, and one of its pilots lost. Thus, even in the face of such a potentially explosive incident, the self-fulfilling effect of the &quot;China threat&quot; discourse has not been acknowledged by mainstream U.S. China analysts. To the contrary, deterring and containing China has gained new urgency. For example, in the aftermath of this standoff, neoconservative columnists Robert Kagan and William Kristol (chairman of the Project for the New American Century) wrote that &quot;not only is the sale of Aegis [to Taiwan] ... the only appropriate response to Chinese behavior; We have been calling for the active containment of China for the past six years precisely because we think it is the only way to keep the peace.&quot; (87) Although the sale of the Aegis destroyers was deferred, President George W. Bush approved an arms package for Taiwan that included so-called &quot;defensive&quot; weapons such as four Kidd class destroyers, eight diesel submarines, and twelve P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft, as well as minesweeping helicopters, torpedoes, and amphibious assault vehicles. On this arms sale, David Shambaugh, a Washington-based China specialist, had this to say: &quot;Given the tangible threats that the Chinese military can present to Taiwan--particularly a naval blockade or quarantine and missile threats--this is a sensible and timely package.&quot; (88) Given the danger and high stakes involved, some may wonder why China did not simply cooperate so that there would be no need for U.S. &quot;containment.&quot; To some extent, China has been cooperative. For example, Beijing was at pains to calm a disgruntled Chinese public by explaining that the U.S. &quot;sorry&quot; letter issued at the end of the spy-plane incident was a genuine &quot;apology,&quot; with U.S. officials openly rejecting that interpretation. On the Taiwan question, China has dropped many of its previous demands (such as &quot;one China&quot; being defined as the People's Republic). As to the South China Sea, China has allowed the ASEAN Regional Forum to seek a negotiated solution to the Spratly Islands dispute and also agreed to join the Philippines as cochairs of the working group on confidence-building measures. (89) In January 2002, China chose to play down an incident that a presidential jet outfitted in the United States had been crammed with sophisticated satellite-operated bugs, a decision that, as the New York Times puts it, &quot;illustrates the depth of China's current commitment to cultivating better relations with the United States.&quot; (90) Also, over the years, China has ratified a number of key nonproliferation treaties and pledged not to assist countries in developing missiles with ranges that exceed the limits established under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). More recently, China has collaborated with the United States in the war on terrorism, including issuing new regulations to restrict the export of missile technology to countries usually accused by the United States of aiding terrorists. Indeed, as some have argued, by any reasonable measure China is now more responsible in international affairs than at any time since 1949. (91) And yet, the real problem is that, so long as the United States continues to stake its self-identity on the realization of absolute security, no amount of Chinese cooperation would be enough. For instance, Iain Johnston views the constructive development of China's arms-control policy as a kind of &quot;realpolitik adaptation,&quot; rather than &quot;genuine learning.&quot; (92) From this perspective, however China has changed, it would remain a fundamentally threatening other, which the United States cannot live with but has to take full control of. I have argued above that the &quot;China threat&quot; argument in mainstream U.S. IR literature is derived, primarily, from a discursive construction of otherness. This construction is predicated on a particular narcissistic understanding of the U.S. self and on a positivist-based realism, concerned with absolute certainty and security, a concern central to the dominant U.S. self-imaginary. Within these frameworks, it seems imperative that China be treated as a threatening, absolute other since it is unable to fit neatly into the U.S.-led evolutionary scheme or guarantee absolute security for the United States, so that U.S. power preponderance in the post-Cold War world can still be legitimated. Not only does this reductionist representation come at the expense of understanding China as a dynamic, multifaceted country but it leads inevitably to a policy of containment that, in turn, tends to enhance the influence of realpolitik thinking, nationalist extremism, and hard-line stance in today's China. Even a small dose of the containment strategy is likely to have a highly dramatic impact on U.S.-China relations, as the 1995-1996 missile crisis and the 2001 spy-plane incident have vividly attested. In this respect, Chalmers Johnson is right when he suggests that &quot;a policy of containment toward China implies the possibility of war, just as it did during the Cold War vis-a-vis the former Soviet Union. The balance of terror prevented war between the United States and the Soviet Union, but this may not work in the case of China.&quot; (93) For instance, as the United States presses ahead with a missile-defence shield to &quot;guarantee&quot; its invulnerability from rather unlikely sources of missile attacks, it would be almost certain to intensify China's sense of vulnerability and compel it to expand its current small nuclear arsenal so as to maintain the efficiency of its limited deterrence. In consequence, it is not impossible that the two countries, and possibly the whole region, might be dragged into an escalating arms race that would eventually make war more likely. Neither the United States nor China is likely to be keen on fighting the other. But as has been demonstrated, the &quot;China threat&quot; argument, for all its alleged desire for peace and security, tends to make war preparedness the most &quot;realistic&quot; option for both sides. At this juncture, worthy of note is an interesting comment made by Charlie Neuhauser, a leading CIA China specialist, on the Vietnam War, a war fought by the United States to contain the then-Communist &quot;other.&quot; Neuhauser says, &quot;Nobody wants it. We don't want it, Ho Chi Minh doesn't want it; it's simply a question of annoying the other side.&quot; (94) And, as we know, in an unwanted war some fifty-eight thousand young people from the United States and an estimated two million Vietnamese men, women, and children lost their lives. Therefore, to call for a halt to the vicious circle of theory as practice associated with the &quot;China threat&quot; literature, tinkering with the current positivist-dominated U.S. IR scholarship on China is no longer adequate. Rather, what is needed is to question this un-self-reflective scholarship itself, particularly its connections with the dominant way in which the United States and the West in general represent themselves and others via their positivist epistemology, so that alternative, more nuanced, and less dangerous ways of interpreting and debating China might become possible. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Japan’s existing security dilemma vis-à-vis North Korea is well known. Japan’s participation in BMD, although not likely to stimulate the North’s already on-going missile programme which is so vital to its diplomatic and military campaign to break out of its international isolation, is also unlikely to curb the North’s build-up of its missile forces, and this is despite opinions which see BMD as a means to convince the North of the futility of threatening Japan and the US. Instead, the principal security dilemma that BMD is likely to exacerbate for Japan is that visàvis China. Chinese policy-makers are concerned that Japan’s development of a BMD 25 system developed in conjunction with the US could lead to the negation of its nuclear deterrent by providing Japan with both a ‘spear’ and ‘shield’. The spear of the US extended nuclear deterrent would be complemented by a BMD shield, allowing Japan deterrence by both punishment and denial vis-à-vis China. Chinese fears might in part be justified as the Aegis BMD system may have some residual or ‘break out’ capabilities to defend against its inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMS), and certainly the US regards the Aegis/SMD component of its missile defence as part of a defensive shield against ICBMs.25 China in all likelihood though could overcome the negation of its strategic nuclear arsenal through the employment of countermeasures and development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV) to overwhelm any BMD system. China’s concerns extend also to the Japan’s possible countering of its tactical ballistic missiles and involvement in the Taiwan issue. China’s worst case scenario would be Japan’s deployment either individually or in conjunction with the US of its sea-mobile NTWD system to defend Taiwan in a future crisis situation. In particular, China would fear the formation of a quasi-alliance amongst the US, Japan and Taiwan. For if the US were to sell AWS and BMD technology to Taiwan, this could result in all three powers being equipped with fully interoperable equipment, so smoothing the way for three-way military cooperation. Japan’s reluctance to become embroiled directly in a Taiwan Straits crisis makes this an unlikely scenario except in circumstances of a full scale conflict. Far more likely is that Japan would utilise its BMD system to defend US forces operating in a Taiwan Straits crisis from bases in Japan; an action that would complicate any attempts by China to intimidate US forces in the region short of initiating a war also against Japan. China can ultimately overcome any BMD system through increasing production of its missiles; a process that is relatively cheap and likely to saturate and overcome any defence. Therefore, Japan’s interest in BMD, although not initiating the process, carries the risk of accelerating China’s upgrading of its nuclear and conventional ballistic missile capabilities and generating further momentum for a regional arms race. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">A war with Taiwan draws in major powers- only scenario for war with China </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Hunkovic 8 [American Military University “The Chinese-Taiwanese Conflict Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan and the United States of America” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Actors and Perceptions: A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study. China: China is undoubtedly the country in this conflict that has the most influence over how it will eventually unfold, particularly, whether or not it turns into a military conflict. While China’s apparent obsession with such a small country for the simple reason that they use to be part of Chinese territory nearly sixty years ago might seem irrational to an observer with a superficial understanding of the situation, the loss of Taiwan could have dangerous political and national security concerns for the country. The Taiwan issue has become a crucial issue of territorial integrity to Beijing, as well as a symbol of the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party; if Taiwan successfully gains its independence, other renegade provinces may attempt to break free as well and the government in Beijing may be viewed as weak by its own people, which could incite revolts and civil unrest. The Chinese government’s worst fears are that the loss of Taiwan could begin a downward spiral for China, leading to the loss of territory, party power and China’s military superiority in the region. Political: Despite the push towards state-sponsored capitalism and the loosening of some restrictions on trade and travel for Chinese citizens, the Chinese Communist Party still rules its country in an autocratic, authoritarian fashion. Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, breakaway provinces, challenges to the government and civil unrest have been dealt with quickly and forcefully, with occasionally infamous results, such as the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989. Definite resentment exists between some members of the Chinese populace who favor democracy and the dictatorial Chinese government, as well as between Beijing and renegade provinces, such as Tibet and the largely Muslim Xinhua province. The Chinese Communist Party has been struggling in recent years to balance its very successful move towards capitalism and modernization with maintaining its Marxist ideals, with Westernizing itself enough to attract international investment and trade without giving its citizens enough freedoms to be able to question and challenge the party’s power and legitimacy. China’s economic future depends on further international investment and being able to present itself as a modernized mainstream state to the world, while maintaining its power over renegade provinces and factions within its borders. This dilemma has caused a degree of infighting within CCP ranks and caused the party to resort to patriotism as a point of agreement. Taiwan has become the focal issue of the CCP, as they view being able to reacquire Taiwan as a move that would strengthen party unity, end a historical humiliation, cause renegade elements within China to abandon their challenges to party legitimacy and allow China to reach its greatest point in history. Economic: Contrary to political and national security concerns, China’s booming economy and lucrative trade and international investment in its country are very strong incentives to avoid any military action towards Taiwan. If China were to attack Taiwan, trade and investment from the United States, who are business partners, but military rivals with the PRC, could come to an end, which would significantly damage the Chinese economy. If the world were to see Chinese military aggression towards Taiwan as the gross brutalization of a smaller country by a much larger and more powerful one, akin to the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, China could quickly not only find other countries ceasing trade with and investment in Chinese companies, but find them reinvesting their capital with Japan instead, permanently stopping China’s meteoric economic rise. Additionally, despite their rivalry, Taiwan is a very valuable trading partner with China and each country has tens of billions of dollars invested in each others’ economies, which would only serve to worsen the economic impact if a Cross-Strait war were to break out. Given the currently dire world economic situation, an unprovoked attack of Taiwan could not only cost China its position as one of the economic titans of the world, but cause depression within the PRC, giving the CCP an entirely new set of problems to address. Therefore, from this perspective, China has a vested interest in either maintaining the status quo with Taiwan, which allows each country to have a working compromise, despite political rhetoric on both sides or being able to place diplomatic pressure on Taiwan to peacefully reunite. The uncertainty of militarily invading Taiwan, especially with the prospect of military intervention on behalf of the United States quite frankly makes an invasion far too risky to contemplate, as the negative impact on the Chinese economy would be certain. Therefore, a war with Taiwan is a losing prospect for China and would be wise to avoid unless determined to be absolutely necessary. National Security: Despite its small size, Taiwan holds much strategic value to the PRC. If it were to establish full independence, Taiwan would be free to not only challenge to power of China and gain UN membership, but would also be free to establish much close military ties with the United States, which would quite possibly include an American military presence in Taiwan, eighty miles from the coast of China. This presence could also include strategic weaponry, including a nuclear arsenal capable of hitting anywhere within the PRC and would effectively end any ambitions of China expanding its territory into the Pacific or Southeast Asia. Such a scenario would have grim national security implications for the PRC. China’s national security issues could possibly go beyond the loss of Taiwan and American military encroachment, if Taiwan were able to gain full independence. After being defeated by a tiny country with a fraction of the military might as the PLA, the PRC could find itself facing a chain reaction of breakaway province trying to secede, including Xinhua and possibly even Tibet. Furthermore, while the international standoff with North Korea over its nuclear program has officially ended, the next leader after the reportedly ailing Kim Jung Il could see a weakened China as an opportunity to resume the development of a nuclear arsenal, which would leave China in a precarious national security situation if relations with North Korea were to deteriorate in the future. In other words, the national security concerns for China regarding Taiwan are potentially grave. If China were to lose Taiwan, at best, its ability to expand into the Pacific would be curtailed and it would most likely find itself encroached upon by the U.S. military and at worst, it could find itself losing other territories, in a similar fashion to the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War and facing a nuclear arsenal or arsenals just beyond its borders, which would effectively end any reign of military supremacy that the PRC currently enjoys. If such were to occur, the CCP could easily lose control of their country, given their loss of power and territory and be in no position to make any demands of the United States on any issues, including the democratization of China, as the U.S. could gain a first-strike nuclear capability against them. Considering these facts, the People’s Republic of China may not be desirous of a war with Taiwan under the current conditions, but absolutely must militarily defend their interests if an attempt at secession occurs, as failing to do so could reduce their formerly powerful nation to a fraction of its former self, as well as incite revolution within the country and a possible overthrow of the CCP. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">China is another matter...a nuclear holocaust. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">China is another matter. No sane figure in the Pentagon wants a war with China, and all serious US militarists know that China's minuscule nuclear capacity is not offensive but a deterrent against the overwhelming US power arrayed against it (twenty archaic Chinese warheads versus more than 7,000 US warheads). Taiwan, whose status constitutes the still incomplete last act of the Chinese civil war, remains the most dangerous place on earth. Much as the 1914 assassination of the Austrian crown prince in Sarajevo led to a war that no one wanted, a misstep in Taiwan by any side could bring the United States and China into a conflict that neither wants. Such a war would bankrupt the United States, deeply divide Japan and probably end in a Chinese victory, given that China is the world's most populous country and would be defending itself against a foreign aggressor. More seriously, it could easily escalate into a nuclear holocaust. Since any Taiwanese attempt to declare its independence formally would be viewed as a challenge to China's sovereignty, forward-deployed US forces on China's borders have virtually no deterrent effect. The United States uses satellites to observe changes in China's basic military capabilities. But the coastal surveillance flights by our twelve (now eleven) EP-3E Aries II spy planes, like the one that was forced down off Hainan Island, seek information that is useful only in an imminent battle. They are inherently provocative and inappropriate when used to monitor a country with which we are at peace. The United States itself maintains a 200-mile area off its coasts in which it intercepts any aircraft attempting similar reconnaissance. America's provocative military posture in East Asia makes war with China more likely because it legitimizes military strategies in both Beijing and Taipei as well as in Washington and Tokyo. Although the spy-plane incident may have provoked new caution in a few Taiwanese who fear becoming the battleground in a China-US war, it also emboldens those who advocate independence from China to continue fostering Chinese-American conflict as a cover for their own aspirations. Former President Lee Teng-hui's controversial visits to both Japan and the United States may be an attempt to do precisely that. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The Chinese leadership thus sees the TMD system as enhancing the capability of the US strategic missile force. Despite US reiteration that TMD is of a purely defensive nature, Chinese analysts see defensive capability as an integral part of an overall offensive design. In this view, TMD cannot be treated independently. This is particularly the case for the United States because of its massive offensive capability, which is further enhanced by the TMD system. 9 Chinese analysts also argue that the operational elements of TMD are more threatening than those allowed by the ABM Treaty. They point out that the ABM Treaty requires that anti-ballistic missiles be deployed in certain sites, and that the size and capability of the deployed anti-ballistic missiles must be limited. The TMD system, whether land-based or sea-based, can be highly mobile, substantially enhancing overall US offensive capabilities. 10 Chinese Arms Control Ambassador Sha Zukang’s remarks at the UN First Committee reflected these concerns. He said, “The so-called TMD which certain countries are going all out to develop will in fact possess the capacity to intercept strategic missiles, thus breaking the limits imposed by the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and rendering the treaty virtually meaningless.” 11 Space Militarization and Weaponization The Chinese leadership is also concerned that TMD will inevitably intensify competition in outer space. Their argument is, first, that TMD will lead to an arms race among major countries. In order to counter this trend and increase anti-ballistic missile capability, military equipment, such as surveillance devices, anti-satellite weapons, and even space-based interceptors, are likely to be deployed in outer space. If one country takes the lead in doing this, other countries will follow suit, leading to space weaponization. Chinese analysts also argue that ballistic missile and anti-ballistic missile technology is convertible, leading to the proliferation of anti-satellite technology. A Chinese analyst with a missile technology background indicated this possibility: “development of the ballistic missile defense system can pave the technological basis for [an] anti-satellite system. When technology for ballistic missile defense is successfully upgraded, the antisatellite system can also be easily developed.” 12 Or as Chinese arms control official Fu Zhigang said at the UN First Committee on November 12, 1997: China is concerned with the use of advanced technology for the development of weapons of mass destruction. An even greater concern to China is the use of advanced technology for the development of outer space weapons (such as anti-satellite weapons) and so-called theater missile defense (TMD) systems. From this perspective, the military use of science and technology is as significant in terms of conventional weapons as it is in terms of weapons of mass destruction. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Any clear-cut distinction between offensive and defense in the TMD context is hopelessly muddied when one realizes that plans for the NTW system include a substantial space component. An elaborate network of space satellites (as well as spaceborne forces to protect them) would be essential features of any robust NTW system, providing early warning data of enemy missile launches, as well as tracking information designed to guide SM-3 interceptors to their targets in mid-flight. It is instructive to note that politically powerful missile defense proponents such as U.S. Senator Bob “Spaceman” Smith (R-NH) envision NTW integrated into an overall space force that would pursue both defensive and offensive military missions.49 We need to incorporate forward-deployed capabilities like the Navy Theater Wide program and the Air Force Airborne Laser as space-based missile defense programs to ensure [that] we can stop missiles in their boost phase, dropping the debris fallout over our adversary’s homes, not ours…[S]pace offers us…the prospect of inflicting violence—all with great precision and nearly instantaneously, and often more cheaply. With credible offensive and defensive space control, we will deter our adversaries, reassure our allies, and guard our nation’s growing reliance on global commerce.50 This full-throated call for a robust blend of offensive and defensive space weaponry reflects a strategic principle elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, “anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand.”51 The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent “dual capability” of spaceborne weapon components. To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting “death stars,” capable of sending munitions hurtling through the earth’s atmosphere at dizzying velocities.52 As Marc Vidricaire, a member of the Canadian Delegation to the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, explains: “If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land.”53 Furthermore, spaceborne BMD components can be used for offensive attacks in outer space itself, where orbiting space assets belonging to adversaries could be targeted for destruction. According to defense analyst James E. Oberg, “…the benign, defensive nature of a ballistic missile killer is not the only facet of such a system—it also has inherent offensive capability against satellites.”54 This dual capability of BMD systems provides one rationale for why space weapons advocates such as Senator Smith propose to make offensive attack weapons part of missile defense. In a world where deployment of purely offensive space weaponry might be difficult to justify as a stand-alone military initiative, Oberg speculates, “the means by which the placement of space-based weapons will likely occur is under a second U.S. space policy directive—that of ballistic missile defense.”55 Although these “death star” scenarios might seem like they come straight out of Hollywood special effects studios, it is worth noting that the U.S. Space Command is on record endorsing military strategy that favors weaponization of space as a force multiplier for offensive attack missions. An official planning document entitled “Vision for 2020” foresees “space-based strike weapons” as part of “global engagement capabilities” designed to enable “application of precision force from, through, and to space.”56 Aggressive pursuit of these “strike weapons” is imperative, according to Space Command officials, because “space superiority is emerging as an essential element of battlefield success and future warfare.”57 Arguing that “it is inevitable that mankind will weaponize space,” Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas D. Bell claims in a 1999 paper that, “The U.S. ability to conduct combat operations in this environment will provide the technical asymmetry that the U.S. will need to win the next war, just as it used strategic bombers and the atomic bomb to win World War II and stealth technology and precision guided munitions to win the Gulf War.”58 These plans recently received concrete expression in comments from Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, Air Force Space Command Commander. While addressing a group at the Joint Tactical Ground Station in South Korea, Eberhart declared that “[s]pace is the ultimate high ground…Not only do we have to use it, we have to be able to defend it and deny our enemy the use of space if we are at war…we have to ensure space superiority for our commanders and men and women who rely on it during the fight.”59 Although missile defense advocates frequently trumpet the “purely defensive” nature of BMD, such systems exist in a strategic framework that ineluctably includes offensive space weaponry. “The PR spin is that the U.S. military push into space is about missile defense or defense of U.S. space satellites. But the volumes of material coming out of the military are concerned mainly with offense— with using space to establish military domination over the world below,” notes professor Karl Grossman.60 Such a suggestion carries particular significance for Japan, since as Frank Umbach, Senior Research Fellow at the German Society of Foreign Affairs, explains, “a possible Japanese TMD deployment may require an integration of the anti-missile defense command and control (C-2) systems of Japan and the U.S., which could have far-reaching implications for both sides.”61 Eventual deployment of a joint Japan-U.S. TMD system could saddle Japanese officials with the sober responsibility of making command decisions regarding use of spaceborne weapons for offensive military missions. It is tempting to take comfort in the idea that JDA leaders would not permit a joint missile defense system such as NTW to evolve into a platform for offensive space power, especially since such a development would flout Japanese legal and constitutional prohibitions against such military adventures. However, in a joint command situation, it is not clear that such constraints would hold up, especially in light of intimidating comments by space power enthusiasts such as Senator Smith, who vows to use his position on Capitol Hill to ram space weaponry down the throats of opponents, regardless of how vocal they are: “If the Air Force cannot or will not embrace spacepower, we in Congress will have to drag them there, kicking and screaming if necessary.”62 Another possibility is that Japanese objections against incorporation of offensive space power into a joint missile defense program could be rendered moot by strategic deception. Part II of this essay explored cases where U.S. missile defense advocates deployed subterfuge to camouflage the actual purpose of BMD programs, in order to insulate the program from political criticism. A similar approach would seem politically attractive for public affairs officers dealing with the sensitive issue of a Japanese TMD’s offensive military capabilities. Since such capabilities would clearly prove to be public relations liabilities for missile defense advocates attempting to justify TMD to Asian publics, there could be great institutional inertia to pursue a Pentagon-style public relations strategy of hiding such capabilities behind layers of secrecy, classification, and obfuscation, then dominating public debate with talk of “purely defensive” BMD systems. However, back door deployment of offensive space weapons would pose grave security risks, given the potentially disastrous consequences of an unconstrained arms race in space. Lt. Col. Bell provides a glimpse of some of the varieties of space weapons that might be produced in such a scenario: “A mix of space weapons will offer the capability to destroy various types of surface and sub-surface targets with three types of weapons: continuous lasers that use heat to melt structures and destroy them; pulsed lasers that vaporize material and penetrate the structure; and kinetic energy weapons that provide the capability to attack targets hundreds of feet under the surface of the earth.”63 According to Senator Charles S. Robb (D-VA), space weaponization could transform Reagan’s hopeful Star Wars vision into an ominous “death star” future. During the Reagan years, advocates of the Strategic Defense Initiative ran an effective television spot featuring children being saved from nuclear attack by a shield represented by a rainbow. If we weaponize space, we will face a very different image—the image of hundreds of weapons-laden satellites orbiting directly over our homes and our families 24 hours a day, ready to fire within seconds. If fired, they would destroy thousands of ground, air, and space targets within minutes, before there is even a chance of knowing what has happened, or why. This would be a dark future, a future we should avoid at all costs.64 A buildup of space weapons with capability to execute offensive missions might begin with noble intentions of “peace through strength” deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that “…the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use.”65 Military commanders desiring to harness the precision strike capability afforded by spacebased “smart” weapons might order deliberate attacks on enemy ground targets in a crisis. The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense “use or lose” pressure into strategic calculations, with the specter of split-second laser attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting death stars with automated “hair trigger” devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed “complexly interactive, tightly coupled” industrial systems, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other’s flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. He further explains, “[t]he odd term ‘normal accident’ is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable.”66 Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to “normal accidents.” It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to Bowman, “even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage—even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!”67 In the same laser technology touted by President Reagan as the quintessential tool of peace, David Langford sees one of the most wicked offensive weapons ever conceived: “One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people.”68 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to a space weapon attack would escalate by retaliating with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Empirically proven BMD development causes restructuring of Article 9- Upper Tier pushes it to the brink </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Toki 8 “Under Fukuda, Japan Accelerates Ballistic Missile Defense Cooperation with the United States” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In December 2007, U.S.-Japan BMD cooperation reached a new milestone when the Japanese Maritime Self- Defense Force (MSDF) successfully conducted its first missile intercept test. The test also indicated that Japan’s new Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda may be as strong a supporter of BMD as his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, who resigned in September 2007. Abe had been vigorously advocating the revision or reinterpretation of Article 9 of Japan’s constitution in order to allow Japan to deploy a more extensive BMD system and to cooperate more fully in collective self-defense with the United States. Fukuda, while not as vocal on these issues, has continued to accelerate the deployment of BMD systems and push for closer security cooperation with Washington. (Most recently, he promoted the Diet’s January 11 passage of a bill to extend the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law to allow the Japanese MSDF to continue its refueling mission in the Indian Ocean, as part of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.) [1] While Fukuda is continuing Japan’s push toward a more robust BMD system, BMD faces on-going opposition in Japan, based both on its costs and its potential to roil relations with China. Transition from Abe to Fukuda Prime Minister Fukuda is generally perceived as more moderate than Abe, who was famous for his conservative nationalism and outspoken support of BMD. In his October 2007 policy statement to the 168th session of the Diet, for example, Fukuda did not directly mention missile defense or collective self-defense with the United States; in contrast, Abe continually highlighted these issues, particularly his desire to amend Article 9, which currently bars collective self-defense. [2] (Fukuda’s silence on missile defense issues in his statement derived, in part, from the need to stress more urgent agenda items facing his cabinet, particularly the extension of the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law.) As part of his efforts to foster closer cooperation with the United States, in April 2007, Abe formed a 13-member “Council on Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security” to make recommendations to the Cabinet by September 2007 on issues related to whether Japan should revise its interpretation of the constitution to allow collective self-defense. Such a change would be needed to permit Japan to participate in a joint missile defense system with the United States that was intended to protect the latter, as well as Japan. [3] However, after the devastating defeat of Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the Upper House Election in July 2007 and Abe’s sudden resignation in September, the Council’s members reportedly decided to delay making their recommendations. In early January Japanese media outlets reported that the Council planned to submit its recom-mendation by mid-January; however, as of January 24, a search of Japanese media failed to reveal whether the recommendations had been submitted to Prime Minister Fukuda. The Council had been expected to recommend that Japan interpret its constitution to allow collective self-defense, as Abe advocated. However, Fukuda’s policy is unlikely to reflect these recommendations, as he is reluctant to revise the interpretation of Article 9. Thus, in effect, the submission of a report will be largely ceremonial, formally completing the work of the Council. [4] Media sources have suggested that, given Fukuda’s cautious attitude toward the collective self-defense debate, he might seal any recommendations offered by the Council. [5] However, Fukuda may not be able to avoid more active engagement on the collective self-defense issue for long. Currently, the Japanese and U.S. governments are jointly developing an advanced version of the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block II A missile to improve its defensive capabilities against longer-range missiles, such as the Taepodong. [6] The new SM-3 is scheduled to be available by 2014. If Japan decides to deploy the advanced version of the SM-3, in addition to the current version, theoretically, Japan would also have the capability to intercept a missile heading for the United States. Thus, the decision to deploy the advanced SM-3 version would rekindle the debate over Article 9. [7] Opposition to BMD in Japan remains significant, based primarily on the considerable cost of the system. [8] According to the Ministry of Defense, the missile defense program is estimated to cost between 800 billion yen ($7.4 billion) and one trillion yen ($8.9 billion) through 2012. However, since Japan plans to continue to pursue still more advanced technologies, costs are likely to increase well beyond this amount. [9] According to the Ministry of Defense, fiscal year 2007, because it was the first year of actual deployment, is expected to mark the greatest annual expenditure for missile defense to date – 186.3 billion yen ($1.7 billion). [10] The total budget allocated for missile defense for fiscal year 2008 is 171.4 billion yen ($1.6 billion), only slightly lower than 2007. [11] Some Japanese defense industry officials assert that the domestic defense industry does not benefit from the government’s spending on BMD, because U.S.-developed and built SM-3s are used for flight tests. [12] In response to such criticism, Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba has insisted, “We can’t talk about how much money should be spent when human lives are at stake.” [13] </span><br />

<span class="Underline">It is not easy to predict Japan’s future path. The outlines of Japan’s security policy—the realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan, BMD, space development, and the demands of the business sector—were all established during the Bush-Koizumi era. The Obama and Hatoyama administrations might uphold this new status quo, or they might set off in very different directions. The Hatoyama government is, for now, buying time before making any major decisions on basic security policy. Under the previous government of Aso Taro, a report by an advisory panel to the prime minister on Japan’s future security was presented in June 2008. The key thrust of this panel was to change constitutional interpretation in order to allow the exercise of the right to collective self-defense. This report was essentially the supreme expression of the “defense reform” built by the Bush and Koizumi regimes. According to this plan, revision of the National Defense Program Guidelines and the Mid-Term Defense Program were also planned for the end of 2009. However, Prime Minister Hatoyama decided to postpone revision of defense policy by one year. He has also announced the establishment of a new panel of experts. Currently, the United States spends 42 percent of the $1.46 trillion dollars of annual global military expenditures, and East Asia is responsible for 13 percent. Furthermore, military expenditure in East Asia is increasing at a speed, which is pronounced even on an international scale. East Asia, home to an enormous U.S. military presence, is becoming the world’s largest weapons market. Japan has considerable latent potential to contribute to the freezing and reduction of regional, and global, military expenditures. Although Japan’s military expenditures remain quite high by global standards, Japan could set an important example for other countries by not increasing this amount and remaining within a standard of less than 1 percent of the GDP. The key issue is whether Japan will continue to develop high-tech military technology relating to BMD or not. The Japanese government and the Japanese public must answer a set of questions connected to these systems. Do they really function? What exactly is this system trying to protect, and from what? Is Japanese industry and technology just being mobilized in order to assume the place of U.S. defense? Is there a calm, efficient, and alternative method to removing the missile threat other than developing intercepting missiles? Toward Innovative Disarmament Cooperation Japanese and U.S. development of missile defense and related technology is clearly stimulating a backlash from China. This, in turn, helps China justify the modernization of its nuclear missile forces, leading to the promotion of a regional arms race and a worsening of the regional security environment. It is possible, through coordinated regional diplomacy and strengthened transparency and verification measures, to remove the nuclear and missile threats in a cooperative manner. Such an approach would increase confidence within the region, improve the security environment, ensure that regional resources are not being wastefully invested in military purposes, and bring us closer to building a sustainable peace in East Asia. To the extent that the realignment of U.S. forces reinforces U.S. regional and global power projection capabilities—rather than functioning as a cost-saving mechanism or as a means to enhance collective security—the backlash in Northeast Asia will be strengthened. If North Korea were to view the realignment of U.S. bases in Japan and South Korea as a threat, it will be less likely to follow through on denuclearization. If the relocation of U.S. bases leads to the construction of new bases within Japan or elsewhere, and increases expenses to that end, a key opportunity will have been lost. In order to serve the purpose of regional peace, the realignment of U.S. bases must be used to close redundant bases and promote their withdrawal. The new Hatoyama government is re-examining and trying to readjust the alliance with the United States in the name of “equal partnership” while also calling for the creation of an East Asia Community. Japan must not be misunderstood as reviving its early 20th-century ambitions for military hegemony in the region. The military spending issue can be a breakthrough for Japan, a way to show its commitment to peace while contributing to the construction of a new regional order. Japan should initiate negotiations with China and Korea toward a mutually coordinated freeze and reduction in military expenditure. Rather than abandoning its ties with the U.S. military industry, Japan should use the arms-export ban principle to negotiate and establish a regional framework to curb the arms trade and weapons proliferation. In 1967, Prime Minister Sato Eisaku introduced Japan’s Three Non-Nuclear Principles: not possessing, producing, or permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons. The Diet established these principles as national policy through a resolution in 1971. However, despite the “non-introduction” provision, considerable evidence indicates the existence of secret deals between the U.S. and Japanese government to allow the transit and port-calls of nuclear-weapons-equipped vessels, even since 1960. The Hatoyama government has established a commission to look into these secret deals. It is important to legalize these three principles to prevent a reintroduction of nuclear weapons into Japan. Legalizing the Non-Nuclear Principles will also create momentum for a nuclear weapon free zone in Northeast Asia that would, in turn, strengthen the nonproliferation regime in the region. Despite the advocacy of Keidanren, a concentrated investment in high-tech, military-civilian integrated technology would not lead to overall benefits for the Japanese economy. Such investments would have little economic effect for the vast majority of the Japanese labor force working in small or mid-size business. If Japan were to throw away its reputation as a “peaceful nation,” which it has maintained throughout the post-war era, the Japanese economy, so dependent on trade with Asia and the Middle East, would necessarily suffer. Instead of viewing the Self-Defense Forces as a way to boost employment, the Japanese government should establish an independent organization with straightforward humanitarian purposes such as disaster relief. Through exchange and humanitarian activities with and in neighboring countries, such an organization could reduce military expenditures and build regional confidence. The development of innovative cooperation for disarmament is now needed. At this critical juncture in history, only a cooperative-security approach can lead the way to the creation of a new order of peace. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">If the possibility existed of a mistaken preemption during and immediately after the Cold War, between the experienced nuclear forces and command systems of America and Russia, then it may be a matter of even more concern with regard to states with newer and more opaque forces and command systems. In addition, the Americans and Soviets (and then Russians) had a great deal of experience getting to know one another’s military operational proclivities and doctrinal idiosyncrasies, including those that might influence the decision for or against war. Another consideration, relative to nuclear stability in the present century, is that the Americans and their NATO allies shared with the Soviets and Russians a commonality of culture and historical experience. Future threats to American or Russian security from weapons of mass destruction may be presented by states or nonstate actors motivated by cultural and social predispositions not easily understood by those in theWest nor subject to favorable manipulation during a crisis. The spread of nuclear weapons in Asia presents a complicated mosaic of possibilities in this regard. States with nuclear forces of variable force structure, operational experience, and command-control systems will be thrown into a matrix of complex political, social, and cultural crosscurrents contributory to the possibility of war. In addition to the existing nuclear powers in Asia, others may seek nuclear weapons if they feel threatened by regional rivals or hostile alliances. Containment of nuclear proliferation in Asia is a desirable political objective for all of the obvious reasons. Nevertheless, the present century is unlikely to see the nuclear hesitancy or risk aversion that marked the ColdWar, in part, because the military and political discipline imposed by the Cold War superpowers no longer exists, but also because states in Asia have new aspirations for regional or global respect.12 The spread of ballistic missiles and other nuclear-capable delivery systems in Asia, or in the Middle East with reach into Asia, is especially dangerous because plausible adversaries live close together and are already engaged in ongoing disputes about territory or other issues.13 The Cold War Americans and Soviets required missiles and airborne delivery systems of intercontinental range to strike at one another’s vitals. But short-range ballistic missiles or fighter-bombers suffice for India and Pakistan to launch attacks at one another with potentially “strategic” effects. China shares borders with Russia, North Korea, India, and Pakistan; Russia, with China and NorthKorea; India, with Pakistan and China; Pakistan, with India and China; and so on. The short flight times of ballistic missiles between the cities or military forces of contiguous states means that very little time will be available for warning and attack assessment by the defender. Conventionally armed missiles could easily be mistaken for a tactical nuclear first use. Fighter-bombers appearing over the horizon could just as easily be carrying nuclear weapons as conventional ordnance. In addition to the challenges posed by shorter flight times and uncertain weapons loads, potential victims of nuclear attack in Asia may Nuclear Crisis Stability in Future Asia 121 also have first strike–vulnerable forces and command-control systems that increase decision pressures for rapid, and possibly mistaken, retaliation. This potpourri of possibilities challenges conventional wisdom about nuclear deterrence and proliferation on the part of policymakers and academic theorists. For policymakers in the United States and NATO, spreading nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in Asia could profoundly shift the geopolitics of mass destruction from a European center of gravity (in the twentieth century) to an Asian and/or Middle Eastern center of gravity (in the present century).14 This would profoundly shake up prognostications to the effect that wars of mass destruction are now passe, on account of the emergence of the “Revolution in Military Affairs” and its encouragement of information-based warfare.15 Together with this, there has emerged the argument that large-scale war between states or coalitions of states, as opposed to varieties of unconventional warfare and failed states, are exceptional and potentially obsolete.16 The spread ofWMDand ballistic missiles in Asia could overturn these expectations for the obsolescence or marginalization of major interstate warfare. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Further, the large number of states that became capable of building nuclear weapons over the years, but chose not to, can be reasonably well explained by the fact that most were formally allied with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Both these superpowers had strong nuclear forces and put great pressure on their allies not to build nuclear weapons. Since the Cold War, the US has retained all its allies. In addition, NATO has extended its protection to some of the previous allies of the Soviet Union and plans on taking in more. Nuclear proliferation by India and Pakistan, and proliferation programmes by North Korea, Iran and Iraq, all involve states in the opposite situation: all judged that they faced serious military opposition and had little prospect of establishing a reliable supporting alliance with a suitably strong, nuclear-armed state. What would await the world if strong protectors, especially the United States, were [was] no longer seen as willing to protect states from nuclear-backed aggression? At least a few additional states would begin to build their own nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them to distant targets, and these initiatives would spur increasing numbers of the world’s capable states to follow suit. Restraint would seem ever less necessary and ever more dangerous. Meanwhile, more states are becoming capable of building nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. Many, perhaps most, of the world’s states are becoming sufficiently wealthy, and the technology for building nuclear forces continues to improve and spread. Finally, it seems highly likely that at some point, halting proliferation will come to be seen as a lost cause and the restraints on it will disappear. Once that happens, the transition to a highly proliferated world would probably be very rapid. While some regions might be able to hold the line for a time, the threats posed by wildfire proliferation in most other areas could create pressures that would finally overcome all restraint. Many readers are probably willing to accept that nuclear proliferation is such a grave threat to world peace that every effort should be made to avoid it. However, every effort has not been made in the past, and we are talking about much more substantial efforts now. For new and substantially more burdensome efforts to be made to slow or stop nuclear proliferation, it needs to be established that the highly proliferated nuclear world that would sooner or later evolve without such efforts is not going to be acceptable. And, for many reasons, it is not. First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous. Proliferating states will feel great pressures to obtain nuclear weapons and delivery systems before any potential opponent does. Those who succeed in outracing an opponent may consider preemptive nuclear war before the opponent becomes capable of nuclear retaliation. Those who lag behind might try to preempt their opponent’s nuclear programme or defeat the opponent using conventional forces. And those who feel threatened but are incapable of building nuclear weapons may still be able to join in this arms race by building other types of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological weapons. [The article continues…] The war between Iran and Iraq during the 1980s led to the use of chemical weapons on both sides and exchanges of missiles against each other’s cities. And more recently, violence in the Middle East escalated in a few months from rocks and small arms to heavy weapons on one side, and from police actions to air strikes and armoured attacks on the other. Escalation of violence is also basic human nature. Once the violence starts, retaliatory exchanges of violent acts can escalate to levels unimagined by the participants before hand. Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse. And such anger can lead us to impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible. In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possible with the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild West of the late 1800s. With most, if not all, nations wearing nuclear 'six-shooters' on their hips, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations, . </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Under the current Japanese government's interpretation of Article 9 of its Constitution, Japan's participation in collective self-defense is prohibited, as is using missile defense capabilities to defend a third country--even an ally such as the United States. Therefore, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a strong advocate of changing Article 9, formed the Council on Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security in April 2007 to provide recommendations on the right of collective self-defense. &quot;Whether it is appropriate for Japan to use its missile defense to intercept ballistic missiles targeting the United States&quot; was one of four scenarios he tasked the council to answer. The council was supposed to submit recommendations to the Cabinet by September 2007, but after the devastating defeat of Abe's ruling party in the upper house election in July 2007 and his abrupt resignation two months later, the council's members delayed making their recommendations. Abe's successor, Yasuo Fukuda, wasn't as enthusiastic about changing the constitutional interpretation. So even though the council submitted its recommendations stating that Japan should have the right to exercise collective self-defense last June, nothing has changed. Taro Aso, the country's third prime minister in two years, is more supportive of the right to collective self-defense, which might revitalize debate over the issue. Technologically, Japan currently doesn't have the capability to shoot down a missile heading toward the United States even if it legally could. But the two countries are currently developing SM-3 Block II A missiles that could potentially intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles. (See &quot;Japan Test Fires Its First Raytheon-Built Standard Missile-3.&quot;) As technological capabilities improve to intercept long-range ballistic missiles, the argument that Japan isn't allowed by its constitutional interpretation to shoot down a missile heading toward the United States might be perceived as unacceptable. Technical limitations. Although both the Japanese and U.S. governments have highlighted successful flight tests, all flight intercept tests have been conducted under highly structured conditions with information about the missile attack. In a real missile launch, it's highly unlikely that the launch location, timing of launch, and flight trajectories will be known, making it almost impossible to predict the percentage of success of an intercept in a real-world attack.

<span class="Underline">The fact that Japanese leaders have already shown a proclivity to extol TMD’s “purely defensive” qualities is evidence that any American export of missile defense to Japan will likely include not only technology, but also accompanying rhetorical strategies designed to politically safeguard such hardware in the crucible of public debate. As discussed earlier, missile defense advocates used Reagan’s suggestion that Star Wars could render nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete” to co-opt the rhetorical high ground occupied by the disarmament left. Tests were rigged and scientific processes manipulated to buoy the political fortunes of the Star Wars, Patriot, THAAD, and NMD programs. Further, the actual purposes of the Timberwind and NMD programs were covered up in attempts to hide politically unpopular aspects of such initiatives. Perhaps these episodes of strategic deception in U.S. missile defense advocacy would be easier to excuse if they were conducted by “rogue” scientists who broke the law for profit or fame. But CIA defense guidance documents, internal DOD directives, and presidential National Security Decision Directives reveal that during the Reagan Star Wars era, strategic deception was not only legally authorized, but also officially mandated, as part of the public relations campaign to promote missile defense.69 Although Japanese leaders greeted American Star Wars-era missile defense overtures with skepticism, the 1998 launch of a Taepodong missile by North Korea over Japan galvanized political support for TMD in Japan and led eventually to the inking of the August 1999 MOU between Japan and the U.S. Unfortunately, the same threatening environment that drives support for missile defense also provides rationales for public officials to ratchet up secrecy and dodge public accountability, with the explanation that full disclosure of the nature of TMD plans and their lack of scientific basis would give comfort to the enemy. However, this preemption of public debate introduces its own set of security concerns. Excessive secrecy locks in Cold War patterns of public discourse, where defense officials and industry representatives monopolize arguments, sealing their positions with the unassailable proof of classified evidence. Threat assessments drift toward worst-case scenarios generated from simulation and speculation, rather than more sober appraisals of foreign military capabilities and intentions. Military officials who see the idea of public debate as a superfluous luxury skirt critical arguments, removing issues of grave national importance from arenas of democratic deliberation. With these patterns of public argument structuring official missile defense discourse in the U.S. during the past two decades, American citizens have been coaxed to spend billions of dollars for doctored scientific experiments that cover up the technical flaws of ill-conceived BMD initiatives. The recent Japan-U.S. MOU on joint missile defense research clears the way for such strategies to be exported to Japanese public spheres. Export of these patterns of public argument to Japan could potentially produce tragic consequences. Profit-hungry aerospace companies, working with government scientists well-schooled in the art of technical deception, could swell political momentum for deployment of a TMD system that appears flawless, yet is riddled with systemic deficiencies that may only come to light in combat situations. This outcome my rockets in future conflicts, when in fact their level of vulnerability to missile strikes would be much greater than believed. could invite catastrophic miscalculations in Japanese foreign policy. False confidence in a seemingly impenetrable TMD shield could prompt Japan’s leaders to expect their nation to be protected from ene One shudders at the prospect that such a discrepancy between actual and perceived effectiveness of a Japanese TMD system would be brought to light by an actual ICBM launch on a Japanese city. Yet this is precisely the scenario that would seem possible if Japanese leaders embrace the American suggestion that missile defense can be a potent tool of diplomacy in scenarios of rogue state blackmail. In such situations, rather than yielding ground in a diplomatic stalemate, shielded nations would dare a rogue state (or state of concern) to follow through on their promise to launch an ICBM. Bluffing poker players who are forced to show their poor cards after a called bet often lose the hand. Presidents bluffing about the capability of their missile defense systems could lose entire cities. Some missile defense proponents maintain that even if a missile shield doesn’t work, cultivating the perception that it does can accomplish important diplomatic aims. On this logic, missile defenses work symbolically like medical placebos.70 For example, adherents of the “Reagan victory school” of history believe that the illusion of Star Wars’ effectiveness sped up collapse of the Soviet Union and helped deliver Cold War victory to the U.S.71 According to this reasoning, although Star Wars was a scientific bust, it nevertheless tricked Soviet leaders into spending millions of rubles in response, bankrupting the Soviet economy and forcing Soviet negotiators to make concessions in arms control negotiations.72 Today, a corollary of this strategy has appeared in the suggestion that a Japanese TMD could have similar effects on China. Some say that while TMD may be useless, it may be a useful tool of diplomatic negotiations. They reason that even though the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), also known as the Star Wars project, was impractical despite its enormous research cost, it was useful to push the Soviet Union into concession in U.S.-Soviet summit talks. By the same token, they say, TMD can also be used to obtain Chinese concessions.73 </span><br />

But CIA defense guidance documents, internal DOD directives, and presidential National Security Decision Directives reveal that during the Reagan Star Wars era, strategic deception was not only legally authorized, but also officially mandated, as part of the public relations campaign to promote missile defense.69 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">When assessing the Japan-U.S. TMD project, citizens interested in government accountability and nuclear safety would do well to put stock in the old aphorism: you can’t judge a book by its cover. If historical trends continue, there is good reason to expect that the official discourse on Japanese TMD will cover up technical failure and disguise politically unpopular missions planned for any joint Japan-U.S. system. There are several negative consequences that could result from such deception. One end result of a politically motivated decision to pursue Japanese TMD, based on doctored scientific data, could be deployment of a deeply flawed missile defense system that is technically bankrupt, yet has an illusory veneer of effectiveness. In addition to the fact that such a fraudulent scheme would sacrifice huge amounts of taxpayer funds at the altar of corporate profit, such a development would present profound security risks of its own. Consider that missile defense advocates point to the possibility of “rogue state blackmail” as an emerging threat justifying rapid pursuit of missile defense. This blackmail scenario envisages major powers embroiled in a diplomatic or military dispute where a socalled state of concern (e.g. North Korea, Iran or Iraq—armed with weapons of mass destruction [WMD]) attempts to exact concessions from wealthy states, by threatening their homelands with long-range rocket attack.45 In such a tragic situation, it is suggested that missile defense would preserve “freedom of movement” to call the state of concern’s bluff. To do this, however, leaders of shielded nations would need to have supreme confidence in their missile defense systems. If such confidence was based on faulty or doctored feasibility data, the stage could be set for a miscalculation of tragic proportions. For example, misplaced faith in a leaky missile defense shield could mistakenly embolden a Japanese president to take diplomatic risks that would recklessly expose thousands (perhaps millions) of civilians to nuclear, chemical, or biological attack.46 Perhaps an even more frightening scenario involves a case where missile defense works—but not for its publicly advertised purpose. The frequent argument that BMD is “purely defensive” belies the fact that much missile defense technology can be used for offensive military missions. Consider that the same missile used as an interceptor in the NTW system, the U.S. Navy Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), can also be outfitted with powerful warheads and used in offensive strikes on land and sea targets. “In a strict definition,” explains Yuan Hong of the Chinese Academy of the Social Scientists, “the TMD is a weapon system with both defensive and offensive capabilities.”47 Such insight is reflected in Newsweek International’s observation that “politicians from Seoul to Surabaya view Tokyo’s new defense debate as a smoke screen for rearmament.”48 Any clear-cut distinction between offensive and defense in the TMD context is hopelessly muddied when one realizes that plans for the NTW system include a substantial space component. An elaborate network of space satellites (as well as spaceborne forces to protect them) would be essential features of any robust NTW system, providing early warning data of enemy missile launches, as well as tracking information designed to guide SM-3 interceptors to their targets in mid-flight. It is instructive to note that politically powerful missile defense proponents such as U.S. Senator Bob “Spaceman” Smith (R-NH) envision NTW integrated into an overall space force that would pursue both defensive and offensive military missions.49 We need to incorporate forward-deployed capabilities like the Navy Theater Wide program and the Air Force Airborne Laser as space-based missile defense programs to ensure [that] we can stop missiles in their boost phase, dropping the debris fallout over our adversary’s homes, not ours…[S]pace offers us…the prospect of inflicting violence—all with great precision and nearly instantaneously, and often more cheaply. With credible offensive and defensive space control, we will deter our adversaries, reassure our allies, and guard our nation’s growing reliance on global commerce.50 This full-throated call for a robust blend of offensive and defensive space weaponry reflects a strategic principle elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, “anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand.”51 The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent “dual capability” of spaceborne weapon components. To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting “death stars,” capable of sending munitions hurtling through the earth’s atmosphere at dizzying velocities.52 As Marc Vidricaire, a member of the Canadian Delegation to the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, explains: “If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land.”53 Furthermore, spaceborne BMD components can be used for offensive attacks in outer space itself, where orbiting space assets belonging to adversaries could be targeted for destruction. According to defense analyst James E. Oberg, “…the benign, defensive nature of a ballistic missile killer is not the only facet of such a system—it also has inherent offensive capability against satellites.”54 This dual capability of BMD systems provides one rationale for why space weapons advocates such as Senator Smith propose to make offensive attack weapons part of missile defense. In a world where deployment of purely offensive space weaponry might be difficult to justify as a stand-alone military initiative, Oberg speculates, “the means by which the placement of space-based weapons will likely occur is under a second U.S. space policy directive—that of ballistic missile defense.”55 Although these “death star” scenarios might seem like they come straight out of Hollywood special effects studios, it is worth noting that the U.S. Space Command is on record endorsing military strategy that favors weaponization of space as a force multiplier for offensive attack missions. An official planning document entitled “Vision for 2020” foresees “space-based strike weapons” as part of “global engagement capabilities” designed to enable “application of precision force from, through, and to space.”56 Aggressive pursuit of these “strike weapons” is imperative, according to Space Command officials, because “space superiority is emerging as an essential element of battlefield success and future warfare.”57 Arguing that “it is inevitable that mankind will weaponize space,” Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas D. Bell claims in a 1999 paper that, “The U.S. ability to conduct combat operations in this environment will provide the technical asymmetry that the U.S. will need to win the next war, just as it used strategic bombers and the atomic bomb to win World War II and stealth technology and precision guided munitions to win the Gulf War.”58 These plans recently received concrete expression in comments from Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, Air Force Space Command Commander. While addressing a group at the Joint Tactical Ground Station in South Korea, Eberhart declared that “[s]pace is the ultimate high ground…Not only do we have to use it, we have to be able to defend it and deny our enemy the use of space if we are at war…we have to ensure space superiority for our commanders and men and women who rely on it during the fight.”5 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Evangelista’s analysis of the influence exerted by transnational peace movement activists in the U.S. and Russia during the late 1980s provides one concrete illustration of how energetic dissent can loosen the grip of the Cold War language game. Using what Olson and Goodnight call “discursive oppositional arguments,” American and Soviet anti-nuclear movements linked up to create, in Rita Felski’s terminology, a “counter-public sphere” that rejected the self-reinforcing logic of what Herbert York calls an “internal arms race.”78 Bernd W. Kubbig, of the Peace Research Institute at Frankfurt, Germany, notes that scientists and scholars critical of the arms race “functioned as icebreakers during the Cold War,” working as an “epistemic community” with “an authoritative claim to policy-relevant knowledge.”79 According to Evangelista, the successful efforts of transnational movement allies to shift the terms of public debate through “strategic use of norms, ideas, and information,” created conditions where the superpowers were coaxed to step back from the abyss of nuclear annihilation.80 A similar opportunity presents itself today, with the Japan-U.S. TMD research project still in an embryonic stage. Recent official discourse on this project largely reflects Cold War themes and norms of argumentation. In Japan, Funabashi notes that so far, “government responses to questions on TMD” have been “provided at only a cursory level,” and that the TMD issue “is something that has been discussed only within an extremely small circle of security professionals— the so-called security high priests.”81 However, peace movement advocates in Japan and the U.S. could use the TMD issue to galvanize transnational counter-public spheres, opening up spaces for perennially excluded and co-opted voices to gain traction in public debates on security policy. In such spaces, citizens from both nations could draw upon each other’s experience to shape the tenor and substance of public discourse. In this regard, Americans sorting through the missile defense issue have much to learn from Japanese nuclear abolition advocates, whose passionate opposition to nuclear weaponry is informed by the direct experience of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. According to Joseph Gerson, of the American Friends Service Committee, the “spirit and commitment” of the Japanese hibakusha (nuclear war survivors) are inspiring examples of the “will and steadfastness necessary to force governments to disarm and to return the nuclear genie back to its bottle.”82 As the only nation to have ever been subjected to nuclear attack, Japan brings an important perspective to discussions of international security in a world bristling with weapons of mass destruction. Such perspective can help refocus missile defense debates in constructive ways on both sides of the Pacific. For example, as the recent report of the Tokyo Forum for Nuclear Non-Proliferation recommends, whatever the outcome of pending missile defense deployment decisions, nuclear disarmament should be the top priority in security policy: “Missile defenses should not be seen as an alternative to the norm of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.” 83 The report further suggests that it is especially important to maintain this emphasis on disarmament even in the event of affirmative BMD deployment decisions, through establishment of clear exit strategies that codify conditions under which missile defenses would be removed: “Nations would be wise to leave open the possibility that defensive deployments could be scaled back, or even eliminated, if the sources of concern were reduced or removed.”84 In the other direction, Japanese citizens pondering the wisdom of spending billions of yen on American missile defense technology might reach more informed decisions by learning from the experience of American citizens, who have witnessed their government’s numerous (and largely futile) attempts to engineer an effective missile shield since 1944, when the U.S. Army initiated Project Thumper, the nation’s first BMD program. The history of U.S. missile defense is a trail littered with false promises, dashed expectations, and fraudulent science. Americans could do a service to their Japanese counterparts by sharing the details of this history, thereby putting missile defense advocates’ shopworn claim that effective defense is “just around the corner” in proper perspective. To the extent that reciprocal dialogue of this sort carves out deliberative spaces for citizens to participate more critically in public debates over missile defense, it has potential to challenge the hegemonic status of technocratic thinking as the basis of security policy. As security studies scholar Simon Dalby explains, the Cold War produced security discourses that “act to reduce the role of political discussion by recasting political issues in terms of technical problems.” Such discourses “depoliticize issues by involving technical expertise in the place of political decision-making.”85 Today’s arguments for missile defense reflect this Cold War pattern of reasoning, with advocates prescribing the technical solution of defensive weapons as an elixir for the political problem of WMD proliferation. In this context, can dialogue and diplomacy really compete with the rhetorically delicious appeal of the missile defense tech-fix? The answer to this question hinges in large part on the efforts of scientists, scholars, and citizens to develop concrete security frameworks that provide credible alternatives to the technocratic model. One promising initiative in this regard is the “Diplomacy First!” proposal recently announced by the Union of German Scientists (VDW). This proposal is remarkable for the way it indicts American calls for NMD and TMD by developing detailed alternatives for dealing politically with the problem of WMD proliferation. Such alternatives are founded on a “policy of prevention” that seeks to control the spread of arms through means of “institutionalized dialogue.”86 Kubbig’s Modernized, Mutually Minimizing Missile Threat Concept (“Quadruple M-TC”) represents one concrete expression of this strategy for achieving post-Cold War security through diplomacy, rather than technological dominance. Kubbig’s security blueprint may be of particular interest to Japanese officials and citizens, since it draws from recent successes in the North Korean case to illustrate the effectiveness of a “Diplomacy First!” approach. Contemporary missile defense discussions are freighted with weighty subtexts that often fail to surface in technically oriented debates conducted in official spheres of deliberation. One such subtext can be cast as a question of governance.87 Should hard choices on nuclear weapons policy be left to the security “high priests,”88 who generally make decisions based on secret data churned through recycled Cold War models? If not, is the vision of a post-Cold War democracy dividend on security policy a workable alternative worth pursuing? These questions signal that missile defense deployment decisions not only present important choices regarding military strategy; as moments of collective judgment, they can also be seen as virtual referenda on the relative merits of technocratic versus democratic forms of governance. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Despite its avowed pacifist security policy, Japan has cooperated with the United States on missile defense since the 1980s. Some in Japan would like to alter the country's laws further to allow for an even stronger missile defense cooperative with the United States. Naturally, China is watching this alliance carefully, warning that it could lead to regional instability and a renewed arms race in East Asia. Japanese security policy is at a crossroads, shifting from a traditional pacifist security policy to a more assertive security policy. As part of this shift, Tokyo is steadily moving toward the deployment of a more robust missile defense system, which the Japanese government doesn't think contradicts the country's &quot;exclusively defensive defense&quot; policy anyway. And while the debate about U.S. missile defense installations in Eastern Europe remains contentious, in East Asia, political debate about missile defense installations in Japan seems to be fading away. Under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, U.S.-Japanese security ties were enhanced post-9/11. His friendship with President George W. Bush also augmented the two countries' bond. As such, it was under Koizumi that Japan officially decided to deploy missile defense in collaboration with the United States. In fact, Koizumi made missile defense a cornerstone of the country's security policy. He wasn't alone in this thinking; many Japanese government officials perceive missile defense as a more realistic option in responding to regional threats such as North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. In addition, Japan's 2004 National Defense Guidelines, for the first time, stated concerns over China's military modernization. History of missile defense in Japan U.S.-Japanese cooperation on missile defense dates back to the 1980s and the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). At that time, Japan's participation in SDI was merely symbolic of U.S.-Japanese security cooperation and helpful to mitigate economic and trade disputes with Washington. This changed in August 1998 when North Korea tested its Taepodong-1 ballistic missile. Even for the Japanese people, who are generally considered pacifists post-World War II, the Taepodong-1 flying over their heads was an alarming wake-up call. Immediately afterward, Tokyo joined Washington in cooperative research and development of a ballistic missile defense system. On the basis of seemingly positive results of missile defense tests and the U.S. decision to deploy an initial national missile defense capability in December 2002, the Japanese government determined that ballistic missile defense had high technological feasibility. In addition, the revelation that North Korea had continued its work on nuclear weapons development and Pyongyang's subsequent withdrawal from the NPT in 2003 convinced Tokyo to officially acquire a ballistic missile defense capability. Thus, on December 19, 2003, it issued the cabinet decision &quot;On Introduction of Ballistic Missile Defense System and Other Measure.&quot; Ever since, establishing a robust missile defense system has been a top national security priority. To implement its new agenda, Tokyo altered its National Defense Program Guidelines in 2005 to indicate that the country's Three Principles on Arms Export and related provisions could be modified as necessary for the deployment of ballistic missile defense. The &quot;Three Principles,&quot; a hallmark of Japan's pacifism policy, long barred Tokyo from jointly developing and producing weapons or transferring weapon parts to foreign countries, including the United States. Tokyo's surprisingly determined and quick adoption of these decisions in order to be ready for the actual deployment of ballistic missile defense seem to be influenced by North Korea's actions. In particular, since North Korea's July 2006 missile launches, which ended its 1999 missile test moratorium, and Pyongyang's October 2006 nuclear test, Tokyo has accelerated its missile defense deployment. Japan's current missile defense capabilities As of January, Tokyo has deployed a multilayered missile defense system that consists of sea-based midcourse missile defense (the Aegis ballistic missile defense system); and ground-based terminal phase missile defense (Patriot Advanced Capabilities-3, or PAC-3). With the accelerated process, a PAC-3 installment in the Tokyo Metropolitan area has been completed. By March 2011, PAC-3 missiles will be deployed at 16 fire units around Japan's major cities. The Aegis system features a three-stage missile (SM-3) with a range of 1,000 kilometers designed to intercept a short- to intermediate-range ballistic missile in outer space. At its first flight test in December 2007, the SM-3 launched from Kongo, a Japanese Aegis ship, and detected, tracked, and destroyed a mock missile that resembled North Korea's Nodong outside the atmosphere at an altitude of approximately 100 miles. With its mission accomplished, Kongo was deployed at Japan's Air Self Defense Force (MSDF) Sasebo base in Nagasaki on January 4, 2008. As the first country other than the United States to succeed in intercepting a mock missile with the Aegis system, Japan might have been overconfident in its technical feasibility. Moreover, at its first test-firing of the PAC-3 interceptor, MSDF successfully shot down a mock ballistic missile at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico last September. This sequence of successful tests might have brought somewhat more optimistic prospects to Japan's defense ministry. Therefore, the failure of a second Aegis test in November significantly disappointed both U.S. and Japanese missile defense proponents. While officials said the failure won't affect the program's future--The Ministry of Defense plans to deploy four Aegis-equipped destroyers by March 2011--some setbacks will be unavoidable. Impediments to missile defense in Japan &quot;Basic Space Law.&quot; Japan's long-standing, self-imposed restriction on the military use of space has impeded it from enhancing its missile defense capabilities. However, in August 27, a new law, the &quot;Basic Space Law,&quot; entered into force, lifting the ban on Tokyo's use of space for defensive purposes. Thirty years earlier, when Japan's Space Agency was established, the Diet unanimously adopted a resolution committing the country only to using space for peaceful purposes, which has been interpreted as non-military. The Basic Space Law changed that interpretation to nonaggressive, meaning the MSDF now can manufacture, possess, and operate its own satellites to support military operations such as ballistic missile defense. Thus, the MSDF plans to procure reconnaissance satellites, early warning satellites, and tracking and communications satellites--all areas in which Japan had been relying on the United States. (See &quot;Japan Enters New Space Age.&quot;) For instance, it was the U.S. Defense Support Program satellites that detected the North Korean missile launches in July 2006. The Japanese Constitution. Under the current Japanese government's interpretation of Article 9 of its Constitution, Japan's participation in collective self-defense is prohibited, as is using missile defense capabilities to defend a third country--even an ally such as the United States. Therefore, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a strong advocate of changing Article 9, formed the Council on Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security in April 2007 to provide recommendations on the right of collective self-defense. &quot;Whether it is appropriate for Japan to use its missile defense to intercept ballistic missiles targeting the United States&quot; was one of four scenarios he tasked the council to answer. The council was supposed to submit recommendations to the Cabinet by September 2007, but after the devastating defeat of Abe's ruling party in the upper house election in July 2007 and his abrupt resignation two months later, the council's members delayed making their recommendations. Abe's successor, Yasuo Fukuda, wasn't as enthusiastic about changing the constitutional interpretation. So even though the council submitted its recommendations stating that Japan should have the right to exercise collective self-defense last June, nothing has changed. Taro Aso, the country's third prime minister in two years, is more supportive of the right to collective self-defense, which might revitalize debate over the issue. Technologically, Japan currently doesn't have the capability to shoot down a missile heading toward the United States even if it legally could. But the two countries are currently developing SM-3 Block II A missiles that could potentially intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles. (See &quot;Japan Test Fires Its First Raytheon-Built Standard Missile-3.&quot;) As technological capabilities improve to intercept long-range ballistic missiles, the argument that Japan isn't allowed by its constitutional interpretation to shoot down a missile heading toward the United States might be perceived as unacceptable. Technical limitations. Although both the Japanese and U.S. governments have highlighted successful flight tests, all flight intercept tests have been conducted under highly structured conditions with information about the missile attack. In a real missile launch, it's highly unlikely that the launch location, timing of launch, and flight trajectories will be known, making it almost impossible to predict the percentage of success of an intercept in a real-world attack. (See &quot;Technical Realities: National Missile Defense Deployment in 2004.&quot;) The Japanese people. The socio-cultural reticence in Japan to any military engagement hasn't made the country's populace fully tolerant of missile defense. Nevertheless, the recent threats from North Korea have dimmed opposition. A 2006 public opinion poll conducted by the Cabinet Office indicated that 56.6 percent of respondents supported missile defense; similarly, a Yomiuri-Gallup public opinion poll [in Japanese] conducted in December 2006 showed that 60 percent of respondents supported it. For those against it, cost seems to be a primary reason why. According to the Ministry of Defense, the missile defense program is estimated to cost Japan $7.4 billion to $8.9 billion through 2012. And since Tokyo plans to pursue still more advanced technologies, costs are likely to increase. China's response Regionally, China has been disturbed by the accelerated progress of the U.S.-Japanese missile defense cooperative. Specifically, China is worried that U.S.-Japanese missile defense could thwart Beijing's limited nuclear deterrent, encourage Japanese militarization, protect Taiwan, and trigger a regional arms race. Chinese opposition to the U.S.-Japan missile defense cooperation isn't as vehement as that of Russia to the U.S. missile defense deployment in Eastern Europe, but if China perceives that the missile shield will shift the balance of power in the region, its opposition will intensify. Future prospects for missile defense in Japan The current security environment in East Asia and the Bush administration's interest in missile defense have helped bring the U.S.-Japanese missile defensive cooperative to where it stands today. That said, President-elect Barack Obama has a different view on missile defense; moreover, he has repeatedly stated that strengthening the nonproliferation regime should be a priority. Thus, it's likely that changes in U.S. security priority will alter Japanese missile defense plans somewhat. Nonetheless, Japan's already scheduled system deployment date of 2011 probably will be met. More generally, a robust Japanese missile defense capability isn't conducive to sustainable peace in East Asia. That's why it's particularly important that Japan and the United States avoid building a structure that looks confrontational to China, which would obviously decrease stability in the region. Therefore, President-elect Obama should shift U.S.-Japanese security cooperation to matters of arms control and nonproliferation while inviting other countries in the region such as China to join in this endeavor. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"> Current Chinese Nuclear Policy It can be safely said that of all the nuclear states, the nuclear policy of China has so far been the most consistent. From the day China first exploded an atomic bomb, its nuclear policy-related statements have remained unchanged. Five major components can be derived from these statements: No First Use Policy No first use (NFU) has been most frequently and consistently repeated in numerous Chinese government statements ever since China became a nuclear weapon state in 1964. By conceding the first use option, China has limited itself to retaliatory nuclear use only. China has also called all nuclear weapon states to commit themselves to a NFU policy at any time and in any circumstances. Security Assurance to Non Nuclear Weapons States and Nuclear Free Zones China has been very critical of the use of nuclear threats against non-nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapons zones. It has repeatedly called on all the nuclear weapon states to agree to a legally-binding, multilateral agreement under which they would pledge not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states and nuclear free zones. This policy component limits China’s potential nuclear adversaries to just the few nuclear weapon states. Apart from the negative security assurance, which China gives unconditionally to all non-nuclear weapon states, China issued its first formal positive security assurance with the other four declared nuclear weapon states in April 1995, promising to come to the aid of any non-nuclear weapon state subject to nuclear attack and pursue appropriate punishment against the attacking state, under the auspices of the UN Security Council. This policy has become part of the UN Security Council Resolution 984. Limited Development of Second Strike, Retaliatory Capability China has repeated its intention to maintain a very small nuclear arsenal on many occasions. In its 2003 Defense White Paper, China states that it “has always exercised utmost restraint on the development of nuclear weapons, and its nuclear arsenal is kept at the lowest level necessary for self-defense only.”[1] However, to make this small arsenal a credible deterrent, China has to make it survivable to a first nuclear strike, even that strike is overwhelming and devastating. In Chinese literature, “few but effective” (jinggan youxiao) are the words most frequently used to describe its necessary arsenal. Opposition to Nuclear Deployment outside National Territories China is opposed to the policy of extended nuclear deterrence, or the policy of providing &quot;nuclear umbrellas&quot; by nuclear weapon states to their allies. In consistence with China’s long standing policy of not sending or stationing any troops outside China, it is also officially opposed to the deployment of nuclear weapons outside national territories, and has stated that China will never deployed nuclear weapons on any foreign soil. Complete Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and Thorough Nuclear Disarmament China first called for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons in its proposal for a world summit in1963, before its first nuclear explosion. On the same day of China’s first nuclear explosion, it again stated that “the Chinese government hereby solemnly proposes to the governments of the world that a summit conference of all the countries of the world be convened to discuss the questions of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and that as the first step, the summit conference conclude an agreement to the effect that the nuclear powers and those countries which may soon become nuclear powers undertake not to use nuclear weapons either against non-nuclear countries and nuclear-free zones or against each other.&quot;[2] This has evolved into China’s basic position on nuclear disarmament and it has never given up its efforts to promote an international convention to ban nuclear weapons. The above major components of Chinese nuclear policy, if interpreted through the lens of Western deterrence terminology, can be characterized as: Strategic Rather than Operational and Tactical Deterrence Mao Zedong, in elaborating China's reason to develop nuclear weapons, said “we will not only have possession of more aircraft and artillery pieces, but also atom bombs. In today’s world, we must have this thing if we don’t want to be bullied by others.”[3] The original purpose of nuclear development in China was to “break up the nuclear threat and smash the nuclear blackmail (dabuo he weixie, fensui he ezha).” As a political instrument, nuclear weapons are to be utilized mainly at the level of grand strategy, not as a winning tool in military operations. The military value of nuclear weapons lies only in its deterrent effect against nuclear attack. The officially declared missions of the Second Artillery Force are twofold: To deter the use of nuclear weapons against China, and To launch an effective nuclear counter-attack in the case of such an attack.[4] No distinction has been made in categorizing nuclear operations. A nuclear strike against China—whether conducted at strategic, operational or tactical level, with high or low yield warheads, or deadly or tolerable lethality—is perceived as the utmost form of warfare in Chinese war categorization, which must be responded strategically. In Chinese strategic literature, we only see the discussion on how to deter a nuclear war from happening, on how to prevent a conventional conflict from escalating into a nuclear war, and how to retaliate after suffering a nuclear attack—but never how to win a nuclear war. The primary Chinese perception is that nuclear wars are not to be won, but to be prevented. Retaliatory—Rather than Denial—Deterrence[5] Many Chinese cite Deng Xiaoping when explaining China's nuclear thinking. He explained, in a meeting with foreigners in 1983: &quot;While you have some deterrence force, we also have some; but we don't want much. It will do just to possess it. Things like strategic weapons and deterrence forces are there to scare others. They must not be used first. But our possession will have some effect. The limited possession of nuclear weapons itself exert some pressure. It remains our position that we will develop a little (nuclear weapons). But the development will be limited. We have said repeatedly that our small amount (of nuclear weapons) is nothing. It is only to show that we also have what you have. If you want to destroy us, you yourself have to suffer some punishment at the same time.&quot;[6] Deng’s statement echoed Mao’s nuclear thinking in several aspects: Nuclear weapons are desirable only for its deterrent value, not for battlefield utility. Nuclear weapons, if ever used, will be used to cause the enemy as much pain as possible, so as to enhance its deterrent value in the first place. Therefore, China has to adopt counter-value as opposed to counterforce targeting strategies, in order to strengthen its deterrence posture. Only a small number of nuclear weapons will satisfy China’s deterrent needs—to convince potential nuclear adversary of a possible nuclear retaliation. Both Mao and Deng are very explicit that the deterrent effectiveness does not increase in proportion with numbers of nuclear weapons. A survivable and invulnerable small arsenal can be equally effective in terms of deterrence. Deterrence effect depends on invulnerability to nuclear strikes, not on large amount of nuclear attack capabilities. Accordingly, what China has been seeking is a nuclear arsenal that is small in size but good in quality. As confined by its adherence to NFU policy, China has to focus its nuclear development efforts on “second strike capabilities” which must be credible and survivable in order to have deterrent effect. Central Rather than Extended Deterrence[7] By declaring to counter-attack with nuclear weapons only after being attacked by nuclear weapons, China has preserved nuclear capabilities to protect its own most vital interests—that is, the existence of the nation. Even during the Cold War years, China has never provided nuclear umbrella to any other country in the world. For China, the concept of extended deterrence has simply not entered into it nuclear calculus—yet. General Rather than Immediate Deterrence The mutual deterrence exercised by the two nuclear superpowers during the Cold War had been directed at one another. They were both 69the ones to deter, and the ones to be deterred. They formed a bilateral deterrent relationship, in which each side was very clear whom it wanted to deter, and what it wanted to deter them from. Their deterrence was more of an immediate nature. China had never comfortably fitted into the bipolar context. It had been in one of the poles for some time, then outside of both poles for some time, and then it tried to be closer to the other pole. In addition, China had not had the luxury of a nuclear umbrella for most of the Cold War years. Therefore, China’s nuclear deterrence had been more of a general nature—in which China tried to form a multilateral deterrent relationship with all the nuclear powers, which only made clear what China wanted to deter. Defensive Rather than Offensive Deterrence One famous tenet laid down by Chairman Mao Zedong is the Sixteen Character Guideline for the use of force—“We will never attack unless we are attacked; and if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack” (ren bu fan wo, wo bu fan ren; ren ruo fan wo, wo bi fan ren). Behind this guideline is a sober headed analysis of power balances. The PLA and its predecessors entered and won most wars as an inferior side against great odds. So a defensive posture had always been preferred to an offensive one. However, Chinese forces have managed to turn from being the weaker into the stronger party in the course—usually a protracted course—of previous conventional wars. When applied to nuclear policy, this Guideline simply means a rejection of preemptive thinking. The renunciation of the first-use option, the willingness to accept vulnerability, the confinement to retaliatory nuclear use, the principle of attacking only after being attacked (hou fa zi ren), the focus on second strike capabilities, and the reservation of nuclear means as the last resort to protect only the most vital national interests, all point to the defensiveness of China’s nuclear policy. Although nuclear weapons are inherently offensive weapons, when deterrence strategies are applied in the way China does, they acquire a pure defensive posture. Minimum Rather than Limited or Maximum Deterrence If I am to choose from Western deterrence classifications to describe Chinese nuclear deterrence posture in general, I would have to use the handy concept of “minimum deterrence” as compared to maximum or limited deterrence. Personally, I think the word “minimum” has too strong a quantitative connotation that is misleading. It sometimes suggests a quantitative standard instead of a qualitative standard. The word “minimum” has for some time been officially used in Chinese government documents.[8] But what I want to emphasize is that Chinese strategists take the concept as a relative one, defined not only by pure numbers, but more importantly by such key criteria as invulnerability of nuclear forces, assurance of retaliation, and credibility of counter-attack. When a Chinese document says that China intends to possess nuclear weapons only at the minimum (or lowest) level for the needs of self-defense, that means to have the minimum but assured capabilities for a retaliatory second strike. Some studies have suggested a shift of Chinese nuclear posture toward limited deterrence, where China could employ nuclear weapons to deter both conventional and nuclear wars, and even to exercise escalation control in the event of a conventional confrontation.[9] However, the basic logic of China’s nuclear thinking dictates nuclear weapons as deterring—not as a means of winning against nuclear weapons. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Japan’s existing security dilemma vis-à-vis North Korea is well known. Japan’s participation in BMD, although not likely to stimulate the North’s already on-going missile programme which is so vital to its diplomatic and military campaign to break out of its international isolation, is also unlikely to curb the North’s build-up of its missile forces, and this is despite opinions which see BMD as a means to convince the North of the futility of threatening Japan and the US. Instead, the principal security dilemma that BMD is likely to exacerbate for Japan is that visàvis China. Chinese policy-makers are concerned that Japan’s development of a BMD 25 system developed in conjunction with the US could lead to the negation of its nuclear deterrent by providing Japan with both a ‘spear’ and ‘shield’. The spear of the US extended nuclear deterrent would be complemented by a BMD shield, allowing Japan deterrence by both punishment and denial vis-à-vis China. Chinese fears might in part be justified as the Aegis BMD system may have some residual or ‘break out’ capabilities to defend against its inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMS), and certainly the US regards the Aegis/SMD component of its missile defence as part of a defensive shield against ICBMs.25 China in all likelihood though could overcome the negation of its strategic nuclear arsenal through the employment of countermeasures and development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV) to overwhelm any BMD system. China’s concerns extend also to the Japan’s possible countering of its tactical ballistic missiles and involvement in the Taiwan issue. China’s worst case scenario would be Japan’s deployment either individually or in conjunction with the US of its sea-mobile NTWD system to defend Taiwan in a future crisis situation. In particular, China would fear the formation of a quasi-alliance amongst the US, Japan and Taiwan. For if the US were to sell AWS and BMD technology to Taiwan, this could result in all three powers being equipped with fully interoperable equipment, so smoothing the way for three-way military cooperation. Japan’s reluctance to become embroiled directly in a Taiwan Straits crisis makes this an unlikely scenario except in circumstances of a full scale conflict. Far more likely is that Japan would utilise its BMD system to defend US forces operating in a Taiwan Straits crisis from bases in Japan; an action that would complicate any attempts by China to intimidate US forces in the region short of initiating a war also against Japan. China can ultimately overcome any BMD system through increasing production of its missiles; a process that is relatively cheap and likely to saturate and overcome any defence. Therefore, Japan’s interest in BMD, although not initiating the process, carries the risk of accelerating China’s upgrading of its nuclear and conventional ballistic missile capabilities and generating further momentum for a regional arms race. </span><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">US-Japan TMD cooperation will lead to war over Taiwan – lowers peace talks and encourages Taiwanese independence </span></strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Kiziah</strong>, Professor at US Air Force Academy, 2k [Rex, Lt. Col. USAF, US-Led Cooperative Theater Missile Defense in Northeast Asia, Air War College, Scholar] </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Perhaps the most important complicating issue between the United States, China, and Japan with respect to the current US-Japanese plans for cooperative TMD development is China’s view of this effort with respect to Taiwan. Ultimately, the Chinese leadership would like to regain control of what it considers to be a renegade province. For 20 THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE China, unification with Taiwan is a cherished national goal. In the past China’s leaders have threatened the use of force if Taiwan formally declared independence, a Chinese government white paper released in February 2000 broadened the reasons that Beijing considered would justify the use of military force—specifically, “if Taiwan’s authorities refused indefinitely ‘the peaceful settlement of cross-Straits reunification through negotiations.’ ”56 Believing that a US-Japan TMD system will also be clearly designed to counter China’s ballistic missiles, then it would eliminate Beijing’s only credible military option to bring Taipei to the negotiating table on China’s terms. Reinforcing this belief is the joint US-Japanese decision to pursue R&amp;D on an upper-tier, NTW-like TMD system. Such a ship-based system would have wide-area defensive coverage and be highly mobile; it could therefore be moved quickly to thwart Chinese actions against Taiwan. The Chinese argue that, even if there is no US or Japanese intent at the present time to use a missile defense system to protect Taiwan in the event of a cross-strait crisis, a shipbased TMD system will clearly provide the United States and Japan such a capability which they may then choose to use. Furthermore, based on extensive interviews conducted in 1996 and 1998 with military and civilian analysts in Chinese government think tanks and academicians at leading Chinese institutions, Christensen concludes that Chinese officials view the Japanese as more likely than the United States to oppose Taiwan’s reintegration with the mainland. Christensen supports his conclusion with the following: Taiwan is a former Japanese colony (1895–1945). It is near international sea-lanes that are important to Japan. In addition, . . . Japan has a strategic interest in preventing Taiwan’s high-technology and capital-rich economy from linking politically with the mainland. Moreover, some Chinese analysts view Taiwan as having geostrategic significance for Japan as a potential ally because of its location near the Chinese mainland.57 Perhaps of even greater concern to Beijing than the use of missile defenses by the United States or Japan in a possible future China-Taiwan contingency is that defensive weapons, such as a TMD system, deployed by Taiwan’s allies and friends may bolster Taiwanese leadership’s confiKIZIAH 21 dence to declare permanent independence from China.58 Preventing Taiwan from legitimizing the current territorial status quo, that is, de facto independence, is a high-priority Chinese security goal as evidenced by their ever increasing coastal ballistic missile deployments near Taiwan and their frequent veiled threats indicating a willingness to risk war to prevent others from intervening in their internal affairs. And Beijing’s concerns and rhetoric do not appear to be diminished by the US’s “three no’s” policy that includes no support for Taiwan’s independence </span><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">A war with Taiwan draws in major powers- only scenario for war with China </span></strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Hunkovic 8</strong> [American Military University “The Chinese-Taiwanese Conflict Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan and the United States of America” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Actors and Perceptions: A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study. China: China is undoubtedly the country in this conflict that has the most influence over how it will eventually unfold, particularly, whether or not it turns into a military conflict. While China’s apparent obsession with such a small country for the simple reason that they use to be part of Chinese territory nearly sixty years ago might seem irrational to an observer with a superficial understanding of the situation, the loss of Taiwan could have dangerous political and national security concerns for the country. The Taiwan issue has become a crucial issue of territorial integrity to Beijing, as well as a symbol of the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party; if Taiwan successfully gains its independence, other renegade provinces may attempt to break free as well and the government in Beijing may be viewed as weak by its own people, which could incite revolts and civil unrest. The Chinese government’s worst fears are that the loss of Taiwan could begin a downward spiral for China, leading to the loss of territory, party power and China’s military superiority in the region. Political: Despite the push towards state-sponsored capitalism and the loosening of some restrictions on trade and travel for Chinese citizens, the Chinese Communist Party still rules its country in an autocratic, authoritarian fashion. Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, breakaway provinces, challenges to the government and civil unrest have been dealt with quickly and forcefully, with occasionally infamous results, such as the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989. Definite resentment exists between some members of the Chinese populace who favor democracy and the dictatorial Chinese government, as well as between Beijing and renegade provinces, such as Tibet and the largely Muslim Xinhua province. The Chinese Communist Party has been struggling in recent years to balance its very successful move towards capitalism and modernization with maintaining its Marxist ideals, with Westernizing itself enough to attract international investment and trade without giving its citizens enough freedoms to be able to question and challenge the party’s power and legitimacy. China’s economic future depends on further international investment and being able to present itself as a modernized mainstream state to the world, while maintaining its power over renegade provinces and factions within its borders. This dilemma has caused a degree of infighting within CCP ranks and caused the party to resort to patriotism as a point of agreement. Taiwan has become the focal issue of the CCP, as they view being able to reacquire Taiwan as a move that would strengthen party unity, end a historical humiliation, cause renegade elements within China to abandon their challenges to party legitimacy and allow China to reach its greatest point in history. Economic: Contrary to political and national security concerns, China’s booming economy and lucrative trade and international investment in its country are very strong incentives to avoid any military action towards Taiwan. If China were to attack Taiwan, trade and investment from the United States, who are business partners, but military rivals with the PRC, could come to an end, which would significantly damage the Chinese economy. If the world were to see Chinese military aggression towards Taiwan as the gross brutalization of a smaller country by a much larger and more powerful one, akin to the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, China could quickly not only find other countries ceasing trade with and investment in Chinese companies, but find them reinvesting their capital with Japan instead, permanently stopping China’s meteoric economic rise. Additionally, despite their rivalry, Taiwan is a very valuable trading partner with China and each country has tens of billions of dollars invested in each others’ economies, which would only serve to worsen the economic impact if a Cross-Strait war were to break out. Given the currently dire world economic situation, an unprovoked attack of Taiwan could not only cost China its position as one of the economic titans of the world, but cause depression within the PRC, giving the CCP an entirely new set of problems to address. Therefore, from this perspective, China has a vested interest in either maintaining the status quo with Taiwan, which allows each country to have a working compromise, despite political rhetoric on both sides or being able to place diplomatic pressure on Taiwan to peacefully reunite. The uncertainty of militarily invading Taiwan, especially with the prospect of military intervention on behalf of the United States quite frankly makes an invasion far too risky to contemplate, as the negative impact on the Chinese economy would be certain. Therefore, a war with Taiwan is a losing prospect for China and would be wise to avoid unless determined to be absolutely necessary. National Security: Despite its small size, Taiwan holds much strategic value to the PRC. If it were to establish full independence, Taiwan would be free to not only challenge to power of China and gain UN membership, but would also be free to establish much close military ties with the United States, which would quite possibly include an American military presence in Taiwan, eighty miles from the coast of China. This presence could also include strategic weaponry, including a nuclear arsenal capable of hitting anywhere within the PRC and would effectively end any ambitions of China expanding its territory into the Pacific or Southeast Asia. Such a scenario would have grim national security implications for the PRC. China’s national security issues could possibly go beyond the loss of Taiwan and American military encroachment, if Taiwan were able to gain full independence. After being defeated by a tiny country with a fraction of the military might as the PLA, the PRC could find itself facing a chain reaction of breakaway province trying to secede, including Xinhua and possibly even Tibet. Furthermore, while the international standoff with North Korea over its nuclear program has officially ended, the next leader after the reportedly ailing Kim Jung Il could see a weakened China as an opportunity to resume the development of a nuclear arsenal, which would leave China in a precarious national security situation if relations with North Korea were to deteriorate in the future. In other words, the national security concerns for China regarding Taiwan are potentially grave. If China were to lose Taiwan, at best, its ability to expand into the Pacific would be curtailed and it would most likely find itself encroached upon by the U.S. military and at worst, it could find itself losing other territories, in a similar fashion to the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War and facing a nuclear arsenal or arsenals just beyond its borders, which would effectively end any reign of military supremacy that the PRC currently enjoys. If such were to occur, the CCP could easily lose control of their country, given their loss of power and territory and be in no position to make any demands of the United States on any issues, including the democratization of China, as the U.S. could gain a first-strike nuclear capability against them. Considering these facts, the People’s Republic of China may not be desirous of a war with Taiwan under the current conditions, but absolutely must militarily defend their interests if an attempt at secession occurs, as failing to do so could reduce their formerly powerful nation to a fraction of its former self, as well as incite revolution within the country and a possible overthrow of the CCP. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">China is another matter...a nuclear holocaust. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">China is another matter. No sane figure in the Pentagon wants a war with China, and all serious US militarists know that China's minuscule nuclear capacity is not offensive but a deterrent against the overwhelming US power arrayed against it (twenty archaic Chinese warheads versus more than 7,000 US warheads). Taiwan, whose status constitutes the still incomplete last act of the Chinese civil war, remains the most dangerous place on earth. Much as the 1914 assassination of the Austrian crown prince in Sarajevo led to a war that no one wanted, a misstep in Taiwan by any side could bring the United States and China into a conflict that neither wants. Such a war would bankrupt the United States, deeply divide Japan and probably end in a Chinese victory, given that China is the world's most populous country and would be defending itself against a foreign aggressor. More seriously, it could easily escalate into a nuclear holocaust. Since any Taiwanese attempt to declare its independence formally would be viewed as a challenge to China's sovereignty, forward-deployed US forces on China's borders have virtually no deterrent effect. The United States uses satellites to observe changes in China's basic military capabilities. But the coastal surveillance flights by our twelve (now eleven) EP-3E Aries II spy planes, like the one that was forced down off Hainan Island, seek information that is useful only in an imminent battle. They are inherently provocative and inappropriate when used to monitor a country with which we are at peace. The United States itself maintains a 200-mile area off its coasts in which it intercepts any aircraft attempting similar reconnaissance. America's provocative military posture in East Asia makes war with China more likely because it legitimizes military strategies in both Beijing and Taipei as well as in Washington and Tokyo. Although the spy-plane incident may have provoked new caution in a few Taiwanese who fear becoming the battleground in a China-US war, it also emboldens those who advocate independence from China to continue fostering Chinese-American conflict as a cover for their own aspirations. Former President Lee Teng-hui's controversial visits to both Japan and the United States may be an attempt to do precisely that. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The Chinese leadership thus sees the TMD system as enhancing the capability of the US strategic missile force. Despite US reiteration that TMD is of a purely defensive nature, Chinese analysts see defensive capability as an integral part of an overall offensive design. In this view, TMD cannot be treated independently. This is particularly the case for the United States because of its massive offensive capability, which is further enhanced by the TMD system. 9 Chinese analysts also argue that the operational elements of TMD are more threatening than those allowed by the ABM Treaty. They point out that the ABM Treaty requires that anti-ballistic missiles be deployed in certain sites, and that the size and capability of the deployed anti-ballistic missiles must be limited. The TMD system, whether land-based or sea-based, can be highly mobile, substantially enhancing overall US offensive capabilities. 10 Chinese Arms Control Ambassador Sha Zukang’s remarks at the UN First Committee reflected these concerns. He said, “The so-called TMD which certain countries are going all out to develop will in fact possess the capacity to intercept strategic missiles, thus breaking the limits imposed by the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and rendering the treaty virtually meaningless.” 11 Space Militarization and Weaponization The Chinese leadership is also concerned that TMD will inevitably intensify competition in outer space. Their argument is, first, that TMD will lead to an arms race among major countries. In order to counter this trend and increase anti-ballistic missile capability, military equipment, such as surveillance devices, anti-satellite weapons, and even space-based interceptors, are likely to be deployed in outer space. If one country takes the lead in doing this, other countries will follow suit, leading to space weaponization. Chinese analysts also argue that ballistic missile and anti-ballistic missile technology is convertible, leading to the proliferation of anti-satellite technology. A Chinese analyst with a missile technology background indicated this possibility: “development of the ballistic missile defense system can pave the technological basis for [an] anti-satellite system. When technology for ballistic missile defense is successfully upgraded, the antisatellite system can also be easily developed.” 12 Or as Chinese arms control official Fu Zhigang said at the UN First Committee on November 12, 1997: China is concerned with the use of advanced technology for the development of weapons of mass destruction. An even greater concern to China is the use of advanced technology for the development of outer space weapons (such as anti-satellite weapons) and so-called theater missile defense (TMD) systems. From this perspective, the military use of science and technology is as significant in terms of conventional weapons as it is in terms of weapons of mass destruction. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Any clear-cut distinction between offensive and defense in the TMD context is hopelessly muddied when one realizes that plans for the NTW system include a substantial space component. An elaborate network of space satellites (as well as spaceborne forces to protect them) would be essential features of any robust NTW system, providing early warning data of enemy missile launches, as well as tracking information designed to guide SM-3 interceptors to their targets in mid-flight. It is instructive to note that politically powerful missile defense proponents such as U.S. Senator Bob “Spaceman” Smith (R-NH) envision NTW integrated into an overall space force that would pursue both defensive and offensive military missions.49 We need to incorporate forward-deployed capabilities like the Navy Theater Wide program and the Air Force Airborne Laser as space-based missile defense programs to ensure [that] we can stop missiles in their boost phase, dropping the debris fallout over our adversary’s homes, not ours…[S]pace offers us…the prospect of inflicting violence—all with great precision and nearly instantaneously, and often more cheaply. With credible offensive and defensive space control, we will deter our adversaries, reassure our allies, and guard our nation’s growing reliance on global commerce.50 This full-throated call for a robust blend of offensive and defensive space weaponry reflects a strategic principle elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, “anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand.”51 The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent “dual capability” of spaceborne weapon components. To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting “death stars,” capable of sending munitions hurtling through the earth’s atmosphere at dizzying velocities.52 As Marc Vidricaire, a member of the Canadian Delegation to the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, explains: “If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land.”53 Furthermore, spaceborne BMD components can be used for offensive attacks in outer space itself, where orbiting space assets belonging to adversaries could be targeted for destruction. According to defense analyst James E. Oberg, “…the benign, defensive nature of a ballistic missile killer is not the only facet of such a system—it also has inherent offensive capability against satellites.”54 This dual capability of BMD systems provides one rationale for why space weapons advocates such as Senator Smith propose to make offensive attack weapons part of missile defense. In a world where deployment of purely offensive space weaponry might be difficult to justify as a stand-alone military initiative, Oberg speculates, “the means by which the placement of space-based weapons will likely occur is under a second U.S. space policy directive—that of ballistic missile defense.”55 Although these “death star” scenarios might seem like they come straight out of Hollywood special effects studios, it is worth noting that the U.S. Space Command is on record endorsing military strategy that favors weaponization of space as a force multiplier for offensive attack missions. An official planning document entitled “Vision for 2020” foresees “space-based strike weapons” as part of “global engagement capabilities” designed to enable “application of precision force from, through, and to space.”56 Aggressive pursuit of these “strike weapons” is imperative, according to Space Command officials, because “space superiority is emerging as an essential element of battlefield success and future warfare.”57 Arguing that “it is inevitable that mankind will weaponize space,” Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas D. Bell claims in a 1999 paper that, “The U.S. ability to conduct combat operations in this environment will provide the technical asymmetry that the U.S. will need to win the next war, just as it used strategic bombers and the atomic bomb to win World War II and stealth technology and precision guided munitions to win the Gulf War.”58 These plans recently received concrete expression in comments from Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, Air Force Space Command Commander. While addressing a group at the Joint Tactical Ground Station in South Korea, Eberhart declared that “[s]pace is the ultimate high ground…Not only do we have to use it, we have to be able to defend it and deny our enemy the use of space if we are at war…we have to ensure space superiority for our commanders and men and women who rely on it during the fight.”59 Although missile defense advocates frequently trumpet the “purely defensive” nature of BMD, such systems exist in a strategic framework that ineluctably includes offensive space weaponry. “The PR spin is that the U.S. military push into space is about missile defense or defense of U.S. space satellites. But the volumes of material coming out of the military are concerned mainly with offense— with using space to establish military domination over the world below,” notes professor Karl Grossman.60 Such a suggestion carries particular significance for Japan, since as Frank Umbach, Senior Research Fellow at the German Society of Foreign Affairs, explains, “a possible Japanese TMD deployment may require an integration of the anti-missile defense command and control (C-2) systems of Japan and the U.S., which could have far-reaching implications for both sides.”61 Eventual deployment of a joint Japan-U.S. TMD system could saddle Japanese officials with the sober responsibility of making command decisions regarding use of spaceborne weapons for offensive military missions. It is tempting to take comfort in the idea that JDA leaders would not permit a joint missile defense system such as NTW to evolve into a platform for offensive space power, especially since such a development would flout Japanese legal and constitutional prohibitions against such military adventures. However, in a joint command situation, it is not clear that such constraints would hold up, especially in light of intimidating comments by space power enthusiasts such as Senator Smith, who vows to use his position on Capitol Hill to ram space weaponry down the throats of opponents, regardless of how vocal they are: “If the Air Force cannot or will not embrace spacepower, we in Congress will have to drag them there, kicking and screaming if necessary.”62 Another possibility is that Japanese objections against incorporation of offensive space power into a joint missile defense program could be rendered moot by strategic deception. Part II of this essay explored cases where U.S. missile defense advocates deployed subterfuge to camouflage the actual purpose of BMD programs, in order to insulate the program from political criticism. A similar approach would seem politically attractive for public affairs officers dealing with the sensitive issue of a Japanese TMD’s offensive military capabilities. Since such capabilities would clearly prove to be public relations liabilities for missile defense advocates attempting to justify TMD to Asian publics, there could be great institutional inertia to pursue a Pentagon-style public relations strategy of hiding such capabilities behind layers of secrecy, classification, and obfuscation, then dominating public debate with talk of “purely defensive” BMD systems. However, back door deployment of offensive space weapons would pose grave security risks, given the potentially disastrous consequences of an unconstrained arms race in space. Lt. Col. Bell provides a glimpse of some of the varieties of space weapons that might be produced in such a scenario: “A mix of space weapons will offer the capability to destroy various types of surface and sub-surface targets with three types of weapons: continuous lasers that use heat to melt structures and destroy them; pulsed lasers that vaporize material and penetrate the structure; and kinetic energy weapons that provide the capability to attack targets hundreds of feet under the surface of the earth.”63 According to Senator Charles S. Robb (D-VA), space weaponization could transform Reagan’s hopeful Star Wars vision into an ominous “death star” future. During the Reagan years, advocates of the Strategic Defense Initiative ran an effective television spot featuring children being saved from nuclear attack by a shield represented by a rainbow. If we weaponize space, we will face a very different image—the image of hundreds of weapons-laden satellites orbiting directly over our homes and our families 24 hours a day, ready to fire within seconds. If fired, they would destroy thousands of ground, air, and space targets within minutes, before there is even a chance of knowing what has happened, or why. This would be a dark future, a future we should avoid at all costs.64 A buildup of space weapons with capability to execute offensive missions might begin with noble intentions of “peace through strength” deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that “…the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use.”65 Military commanders desiring to harness the precision strike capability afforded by spacebased “smart” weapons might order deliberate attacks on enemy ground targets in a crisis. The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense “use or lose” pressure into strategic calculations, with the specter of split-second laser attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting death stars with automated “hair trigger” devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed “complexly interactive, tightly coupled” industrial systems, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other’s flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. He further explains, “[t]he odd term ‘normal accident’ is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable.”66 Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to “normal accidents.” It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to Bowman, “even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage—even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!”67 In the same laser technology touted by President Reagan as the quintessential tool of peace, David Langford sees one of the most wicked offensive weapons ever conceived: “One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people.”68 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to a space weapon attack would escalate by retaliating with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">This is the second of two scenarios that consider how U.S. space weapons might create incentives for America’s opponents to behave in dangerous ways. The previous scenario looked at the systemic risk of accidents that could arise from keeping nuclear weapons on high alert to guard against a space weapons attack. This section focuses on the risk that a single accident in space, such as a piece of space debris striking a Russian early-warning satellite, might be the catalyst for an accidental nuclear war. As we have noted in an earlier section, the United States canceled its own ASAT program in the 1980s over concerns that the deployment of these weapons might be deeply destabilizing. For all the talk about a “new relationship” between the United States and Russia, both sides retain thousands of nuclear forces on alert and conﬁgured to ﬁght a nuclear war. When briefed about the size and status of U.S. nuclear forces, President George W. Bush reportedly asked “What do we need all these weapons for?” 43 The answer, as it was during the Cold War, is that the forces remain on alert to conduct a number of possible contingencies, including a nuclear strike against Russia. This fact, of course, is not lost on the Russian leadership, which has been increasing its reliance on nuclear weapons to compensate for the country’s declining military might. In the mid-1990s, Russia dropped its pledge to refrain from the “ﬁrst use” of nuclear weapons and conducted a series of exercises in which Russian nuclear forces prepared to use nuclear weapons to repel a NATO invasion. In October 2003, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov reiterated that Moscow might use nuclear weapons “preemptively” in any number of contingencies, including a NATO attack. 44 So, it remains business as usual with U.S. and Russian nuclear forces. And business as usual includes the occasional false alarm of a nuclear attack. There have been several of these incidents over the years. In September 1983, as a relatively new Soviet early-warning satellite moved into position to monitor U.S. missile ﬁelds in North Dakota, the sun lined up in just such a way as to fool the Russian satellite into reporting that half a dozen U.S. missiles had been launched at the Soviet Union. Perhaps mindful that a brand new satellite might malfunction, the ofﬁcer in charge of the command center that monitored data from the early-warning satellites refused to pass the alert to his superiors. He reportedly explained his caution by saying: “When people start a war, they don’t start it with only ﬁve missiles. You can do little damage with just ﬁve missiles.” 45 In January 1995, Norwegian scientists launched a sounding rocket on a trajectory similar to one that a U.S. Trident missile might take if it were launched to blind Russian radars with a high 26 What if Space Were Weaponized? altitude nuclear detonation. The incident was apparently serious enough that, the next day, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated that he had activated his “nuclear football” – a device that allows the Russian president to communicate with his military advisors and review his options for launching his arsenal. In this case, the Russian early-warning satellites could clearly see that no attack was under way and the crisis passed without incident. 46 In both cases, Russian observers were conﬁdent that what appeared to be a “small” attack was not a fragmentary picture of a much larger one. In the case of the Norwegian sounding rocket, space-based sensors played a crucial role in assuring the Russian leadership that it was not under attack. The Russian command system, however, is no longer able to provide such reliable, early warning. The dissolution of the Soviet Union cost Moscow several radar stations in newly independent states, creating “attack corridors” through which Moscow could not see an attack launched by U.S. nuclear submarines. 47 Further, Russia’s constellation of early-warning satellites has been allowed to decline – only one or two of the six satellites remain operational, leaving Russia with early warning for only six hours a day. Russia is attempting to reconstitute its constellation of early-warning satellites, with several launches planned in the next few years. But Russia will still have limited warning and will depend heavily on its space-based systems to provide warning of an American attack. 48 As the previous section explained, the Pentagon is contemplating military missions in space that will improve U.S. ability to cripple Russian nuclear forces in a crisis before they can execute an attack on the United States. Anti-satellite weapons, in this scenario, would blind Russian reconnaissance and warning satellites and knock out communications satellites. Such strikes might be the prelude to a full-scale attack, or a limited effort, as attempted in a war game at Schriever Air Force Base, to conduct “early deterrence strikes” to signal U.S. resolve and control escalation. 49 By 2010, the United States may, in fact, have an arsenal of ASATs (perhaps even on orbit 24/7) ready to conduct these kinds of missions – to coerce opponents and, if necessary, support preemptive attacks. Moscow would certainly have to worry that these ASATs could be used in conjunction with other space-enabled systems – for example, long-range strike systems that could attack targets in less than 90 minutes – to disable Russia’s nuclear deterrent before the Russian leadership understood what was going on. What would happen if a piece of space debris were to disable a Russian early-warning satellite under these conditions? Could the Russian military distinguish between an accident in space and the ﬁrst phase of a U.S. attack? Most Russian early-warning satellites are in elliptical Molniya orbits (a few are in GEO) and thus difﬁcult to attack from the ground or air. At a minimum, Moscow would probably have some tactical warning of such a suspicious launch, but given the sorry state of Russia’s warning, optical imaging and signals intelligence satellites there is reason to ask the question. Further, the advent of U.S. on-orbit ASATs, as now envisioned 50 could make both the more difﬁcult orbital plane and any warning systems moot. The unpleasant truth is that the Russians likely would have to make a judgment call. No state has the ability to deﬁnitively determine the cause of the satellite’s failure. Even the Accidental Nuclear War Scenarios 27 United States does not maintain (nor is it likely to have in place by 2010) a sophisticated space surveillance system that would allow it to distinguish between a satellite malfunction, a debris strike or a deliberate attack – and Russian space surveillance capabilities are much more limited by comparison. Even the risk assessments for collision with debris are speculative, particularly for the unique orbits in which Russian early-warning satellites operate. During peacetime, it is easy to imagine that the Russians would conclude that the loss of a satellite was either a malfunction or a debris strike. But how conﬁdent could U.S. planners be that the Russians would be so calm if the accident in space occurred in tandem with a second false alarm, or occurred during the middle of a crisis? What might happen if the debris strike occurred shortly after a false alarm showing a missile launch? False alarms are appallingly common – according to information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) experienced 1,172 “moderately serious” false alarms between 1977 and 1983 – an average of almost three false alarms per week. Comparable information is not available about the Russian system, but there is no reason to believe that it is any more reliable. 51 Assessing the likelihood of these sorts of coincidences is difﬁcult because Russia has never provided data about the frequency or duration of false alarms; nor indicated how seriously earlywarning data is taken by Russian leaders. Moreover, there is no reliable estimate of the debris risk for Russian satellites in highly elliptical orbits. 52 The important point, however, is that such a coincidence would only appear suspicious if the United States were in the business of disabling satellites – in other words, there is much less risk if Washington does not develop ASATs. The loss of an early-warning satellite could look rather ominous if it occurred during a period of major tension in the relationship. While NATO no longer sees Russia as much of a threat, the same cannot be said of the converse. Despite the warm talk, Russian leaders remain wary of NATO expansion, particularly the effect expansion may have on the Baltic port of Kaliningrad. Although part of Russia, Kaliningrad is separated from the rest of Russia by Lithuania and Poland. Russia has already complained about its decreasing lack of access to the port, particularly the uncooperative attitude of the Lithuanian government. 53 News reports suggest that an edgy Russia may have moved tactical nuclear weapons into the enclave. 54 If the Lithuanian government were to close access to Kaliningrad in a ﬁt of pique, this would trigger a major crisis between NATO and Russia. Under these circumstances, the loss of an early-warning satellite would be extremely suspicious. It is any military’s nature during a crisis to interpret events in their worst-case light. For example, consider the coincidences that occurred in early September 1956, during the extraordinarily tense period in international relations marked by the Suez Crisis and Hungarian uprising. 55 On one evening the White House received messages indicating: 1. the Turkish Air Force had gone on alert in response to unidentiﬁed aircraft penetrating its airspace; 2. one hundred Soviet MiG-15s were ﬂying over Syria; 3. a British Canberra bomber had been shot down over Syria, most likely by a MiG; and 4. The Russian ﬂeet was moving through the Dardanelles. Gen. Andrew 28 What if Space Were Weaponized? Goodpaster was reported to have worried that the conﬂuence of events “might trigger off … the NATO operations plan” that called for a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union. Yet, all of these reports were false. The “jets” over Turkey were a ﬂock of swans; the Soviet MiGs over Syria were a smaller, routine escort returning the president from a state visit to Moscow; the bomber crashed due to mechanical difﬁculties; and the Soviet ﬂeet was beginning long-scheduled exercises. In an important sense, these were not “coincidences” but rather different manifestations of a common failure – human error resulting from extreme tension of an international crisis. As one author noted, “The detection and misinterpretation of these events, against the context of world tensions from Hungary and Suez, was the ﬁrst major example of how the size and complexity of worldwide electronic warning systems could, at certain critical times, create momentum of its own.” Perhaps most worrisome, the United States might be blithely unaware of the degree to which the Russians were concerned about its actions and inadvertently escalate a crisis. During the early 1980s, the Soviet Union suffered a major “war scare” during which time its leadership concluded that bilateral relations were rapidly declining. This war scare was driven in part by the rhetoric of the Reagan administration, fortiﬁed by the selective reading of intelligence. During this period, NATO conducted a major command post exercise, Able Archer, that caused some elements of the Soviet military to raise their alert status. American ofﬁcials were stunned to learn, after the fact, that the Kremlin had been acutely nervous about an American ﬁrst strike during this period. 56 All of these incidents have a common theme – that conﬁdence is often the difference between war and peace. In times of crisis, false alarms can have a momentum of their own. As in the second scenario in this monograph, the lesson is that commanders rely on the steady ﬂow of reliable information. When that information ﬂow is disrupted – whether by a deliberate attack or an accident – conﬁdence collapses and the result is panic and escalation. Introducing ASAT weapons into this mix is all the more dangerous, because such weapons target the elements of the command system that keep leaders aware, informed and in control. As a result, the mere presence of such weapons is corrosive to the conﬁdence that allows national nuclear forces to operate safely </span><br />

<span class="Underline">A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization. Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately. There is also a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan for instance, is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently. Such a war might however be a local terminal risk for the cities most likely to be targeted. Unfortunately, we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">China's position on TMD is largely influenced by its profound mistrust of Japan, which dates back to the Japanese annexation of Manchuria in 1931 and atrocities committed during World War II. Ambassador Sha has stated, &quot;We are still suffering from our nightmare with Japan since the war. These are a people who even deny the fact that there was something called the Nanking Massacre; some of them feel it didn't happen at all. So how can we have any confidence in a country like that?&quot;21 Despite China's strong opposition to TMD cooperation with Japan, PRC officials have indicated a willingness to accept deployment of lower-tier TMD in Japan. China considers lower-tier theater missile defenses to be &quot;legitimate&quot; missile defenses since these systems have a limited footprint that can only protect small areas such as military bases and troop deployments from missile attacks.22 China's concerns about Japan's development of an upper-tier TMD system, especially a sea-based one, are based on the fear that such a system would also be capable of defending Taiwan in the event of a missile attack from the mainland. The US Navy's Theater Wide (NTW) system could be based in Japan but still be easily deployed near Taiwan. According to a 1999 Pentagon report, one Aegis cruiser equipped with the NTW system could defend all of Taiwan. China's Opposition to National Missile Defense China's vehement opposition to US NMD plans is based on two main arguments. On the one hand, China is concerned that US efforts to modify the ABM Treaty and plans to deploy a multi-site NMD system will severely undermine China's small strategic deterrent capability. On the other hand, US NMD plans would lead to a complete halt to US-Russian strategic arms reductions, a possible resumption of an arms race and a general deterioration in other global arms control and nonproliferation efforts such as CTBT ratification and negotiation of a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT).23 Chinese analysts argue that the United States has exaggerated the risk of rogue nations developing long range missiles with nuclear warheads. Chinese experts have argued that spending the time and resources on developing NMD in response to the rogue-nation missile threat is akin to &quot;using a cannon to hit a fly.&quot; US retaliatory capabilities are sufficient to deter rogue nations from launching an attack. Many Chinese further maintain that the United States is using the rogue missile threat as &quot;a pretext&quot; to develop and deploy NMD, when its actual purpose is to contain China. Undermining China's Strategic Nuclear Deterrent China's primary concern is that NMD will downgrade or negate China's strategic nuclear deterrent. China's nuclear arsenal is the smallest of the five declared nuclear powers and is centered around about 20 land-based ICBMs. China's strategic nuclear forces are mostly based upon woefully outdated 1950s and 1960s aircraft and missile technologies. China's nuclear capable bombers lack sufficient range and are too slow to penetrate modern air defenses. The bulk of China's ICBM forces are liquid-fueled, based at fixed sites (including highly vulnerable silos) and require lengthy launch preparation. China is believed to store its nuclear warheads separate from its missiles, further increasing launch preparation time. Although the PRC has begun to modernize its long-range missile force by developing solid fueled, road-mobile systems, none of these missiles have been deployed. China conducted its first flight-test of its new 8000 km range DF-31 missile in August 1999; the 13000 km range DF-41 is still under development. Finally, China's single Xia-class submarine is virtually non-operational. With such a small, technologically inferior force, China is concerned that a missile defense system would render its second strike capability impotent and thus enable the United States to use nuclear blackmail against China. Collapse of US-Russian Arms Control Efforts China is also concerned that NMD deployment will halt US-Russian arms reduction efforts such as Russia's ratification of the START II treaty and negotiations on a START III treaty. Russia may refuse to continue to reduce its nuclear arsenal or Russia may backtrack on some of commitments by retaining a small number of land-based MIRVd missiles (which are banned under START II). Russia's response to NMD could also degrade China's deterrent capabilities. Russian deployment of new missiles or refusal to reduce its current arsenal significantly affects China given the small size of China's force relative to Russia's and the possibility of renewed Sino-Russian conflict. A Russian decision to continue nuclear testing could also threaten China if Russia develops new types of nuclear weapons or smaller warheads that could be MRVed. Chinese Efforts to Counter NMD China has identified three ways to counter NMD: (1) expanding its missile force; (2) developing countermeasures such as penetration aids; and (3) developing multiple reentry vehicle (MRV) or multiple independently targeted reentry vehicle (MIRV) technology. However, it has been difficult to separate Chinese ballistic missile development and deployment efforts aimed at overcoming ballistic missile defenses from China's general strategic modernization program. As early as 1981 China delivered three satellites with one launch vehicle, indicating an incipient MRV capability. According to a leaked 1999 National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC) report, China's 2 August 1999 test launch of the DF-31 ICBM included the use of penetration aids.24 While development of penetration aids suggests that China is seeking to overcome future missile defenses, to date China has not engaged in a rapid increase in its ICBM force. China is developing new missiles such as the DF-31 and DF-41, but these programs were initiated over a decade ago and were probably not a direct response to NMD. Despite these indications, China has stated that it will not enter an arms race with the United States.25 Having seen the demise of the Soviet Union, Chinese leaders do not want to sacrifice China's economic modernization in a costly arms race with the United States. Matching the United States missile for missile or developing a Chinese NMD system would require diverting billions of US dollars and many of China's brightest minds away from economic modernization. This reallocation of resources would only delay China's emergence as a world power and ultimately hinder China's overall military modernization. China's Anti-NMD Diplomatic Offensive China has launched a broad diplomatic effort to oppose US efforts to modify the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and to deploy NMD. Bilaterally, China has begun cooperating with Russia to denounce NMD as a violation of the ABM Treaty and to halt US efforts to modify the ABM Treaty. Multilaterally, China has used the Conference on Disarmament (CD) to oppose missile defense (and especially space-based missile defenses). Opposition to Revision of ABM Treaty China opposes any revisions to the ABM Treaty that would allow deployment of new missile defense systems. In a speech before the United Nations, China's deputy director general of arms control, Hu Xiaodi, has stated: the ABM Treaty is, however, now confronted with grave challenges flowing from some recent negative developments in the international situation. In seeking its own absolute security and strategic advantage, a state party to the Treaty is now not only vigorously pursuing its own NMD program, but also pressing rapidly ahead with its joint TMD development program with some other individual countries. Such moves not only fly in the face of the purposes and principles of the Treaty, but are also very much at odds with the core provision of the Treaty.26 China believes that initial US moves to amend the Treaty will only be followed by requests for more amendments, which will eviscerate the Treaty. Sha Zukang has stated: We can say with certainty that once the treaty is amended, it will be amended again and again because of the change of situations, and finally it will be nullified. If so, the &quot;Anti-Missile Treaty&quot; will exist in name only and will be a mere scrap of paper. We hope that the United States will start afresh, give up the treaty amendment attempt, and return to the correct track of really safeguarding the ABM Treaty.27 As part of its effort to pressure the United States not to modify the ABM Treaty, China has begun cooperating with Russia to condemn US efforts to develop missile defense systems. On 14 April 1999, China and Russia released a joint press communiqué on the ABM Treaty which stated that &quot;to preserve and strengthen the ABM Treaty is of critical importance&quot; and that the ABM Treaty is the &quot;cornerstone for maintaining global strategic stability.&quot; The statement also committed both sides to continue &quot;consultations and cooperation&quot; on efforts to preserve the ABM Treaty.28 As a result of this cooperation, on 21 October 1999 China co-sponsored a Russian resolution at the United Nations entitled, &quot;Prevention and Compliance with Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.&quot; The resolution called for &quot;renewed efforts by each of the states parties to preserve and strengthen the ABM Treaty through full and strict compliance.&quot;29 However, Sino-Russian cooperation has thus far been limited to rhetoric. Responding to a question on whether Chinese and Russian opposition to missile defense systems would result in cooperative efforts, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji stated that while both countries are opposed to missile defenses, it &quot;did not mean that [we] have already discussed joint measures to counter this program. The time has not yet come for that.&quot;30 Despite Sino-Russian cooperation on revisting changes in the ABM Treaty, Chinese officials are aware that US NMD deployment would not threaten the credibility of Russia's deterrent. They worry that Russia will ultimately compromise with the United States on ABM Treaty revisions at the expense of Chinese interests. China has also proposed making the ABM Treaty a multilateral accord.31 By becoming a member of the ABM Treaty China would be able to influence negotiations between the United States and Russia, strengthening Russia's opposition to amending the Treaty. China would also be able to prevent the transfer of missile defense technology from the United States to Russia as payment for Russia's approval of the amendments to the Treaty. This effort indicates Chinese fears that Russia will agree to modifications of the ABM treaty that harm China's strategic interests. Opposition at the Conference on Disarmament China has also used multilateral fora such as the Conference on Disarmament (CD) to express its opposition to ABM revisions and NMD deployment. Believing that the development of missile defenses will lead to arms race in outer space, China has repeatedly called for the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of An Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS). The United States has opposed such efforts. In a 13 October 1999 speech to the United Nations General Assembly, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations Shen Guofang condemned US efforts to block the formation of such a committee: A certain country has, on the one hand, tried hard to block the establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on PAROS at the Conference on Disarmament, but on the other hand, pressed rapidly ahead in pursuing its outer space and missile defense programs in an attempt to seek military advantage on the ground through dominating and controlling outer space. . .The development in the vigorous pursuit of missile defense systems since the beginning of this year is most disturbing.32 Since China currently lacks the resources to compete with the United States in an outer space arms race, it fears that deployment of space-based weapons could give the United States an overwhelming edge and the ability to negate China's nuclear deterrent for years to come. China is also concerned that an arms race with the technologically superior United States could derail China's economic growth. Although China has a vibrant space program, it would require years and billions of dollars to even approach US space defense technology. China's Indigenous Missile Defense Capabilities China is not opposed to every form of missile defense. China considers lower-tier theater missile defenses to be &quot;legitimate&quot; missile defenses since these systems can only protect small areas from missile attacks. China's approval of lower-tier missile defenses also stems from the fact that China has purchased S-300 (NATO designation: SA-10) anti-aircraft missile systems from Russia which have an inherent anti-missile capability. According to an unconfirmed source, China is also developing its own TMD, called KDI. KDI is said to have a range of 25 km with a maximum speed of Mach 4 and is capable of hitting a number of missiles.33China and Russia have reportedly discussed the potential for cooperation in the missile defense area, but to date there has been no evidence that any specific development efforts are underway.34 </span><br />

 <strong><span class="Underline">Empirically proven BMD development causes restructuring of Article 9- Upper Tier pushes it to the brink </span></strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Toki 8</strong> “Under Fukuda, Japan Accelerates Ballistic Missile Defense Cooperation with the United States” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In December 2007, U.S.-Japan BMD cooperation reached a new milestone when the Japanese Maritime Self- Defense Force (MSDF) successfully conducted its first missile intercept test. The test also indicated that Japan’s new Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda may be as strong a supporter of BMD as his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, who resigned in September 2007. Abe had been vigorously advocating the revision or reinterpretation of Article 9 of Japan’s constitution in order to allow Japan to deploy a more extensive BMD system and to cooperate more fully in collective self-defense with the United States. Fukuda, while not as vocal on these issues, has continued to accelerate the deployment of BMD systems and push for closer security cooperation with Washington. (Most recently, he promoted the Diet’s January 11 passage of a bill to extend the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law to allow the Japanese MSDF to continue its refueling mission in the Indian Ocean, as part of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.) [1] While Fukuda is continuing Japan’s push toward a more robust BMD system, BMD faces on-going opposition in Japan, based both on its costs and its potential to roil relations with China. Transition from Abe to Fukuda Prime Minister Fukuda is generally perceived as more moderate than Abe, who was famous for his conservative nationalism and outspoken support of BMD. In his October 2007 policy statement to the 168th session of the Diet, for example, Fukuda did not directly mention missile defense or collective self-defense with the United States; in contrast, Abe continually highlighted these issues, particularly his desire to amend Article 9, which currently bars collective self-defense. [2] (Fukuda’s silence on missile defense issues in his statement derived, in part, from the need to stress more urgent agenda items facing his cabinet, particularly the extension of the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law.) As part of his efforts to foster closer cooperation with the United States, in April 2007, Abe formed a 13-member “Council on Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security” to make recommendations to the Cabinet by September 2007 on issues related to whether Japan should revise its interpretation of the constitution to allow collective self-defense. Such a change would be needed to permit Japan to participate in a joint missile defense system with the United States that was intended to protect the latter, as well as Japan. [3] However, after the devastating defeat of Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the Upper House Election in July 2007 and Abe’s sudden resignation in September, the Council’s members reportedly decided to delay making their recommendations. In early January Japanese media outlets reported that the Council planned to submit its recom-mendation by mid-January; however, as of January 24, a search of Japanese media failed to reveal whether the recommendations had been submitted to Prime Minister Fukuda. The Council had been expected to recommend that Japan interpret its constitution to allow collective self-defense, as Abe advocated. However, Fukuda’s policy is unlikely to reflect these recommendations, as he is reluctant to revise the interpretation of Article 9. Thus, in effect, the submission of a report will be largely ceremonial, formally completing the work of the Council. [4] Media sources have suggested that, given Fukuda’s cautious attitude toward the collective self-defense debate, he might seal any recommendations offered by the Council. [5] However, Fukuda may not be able to avoid more active engagement on the collective self-defense issue for long. Currently, the Japanese and U.S. governments are jointly developing an advanced version of the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block II A missile to improve its defensive capabilities against longer-range missiles, such as the Taepodong. [6] The new SM-3 is scheduled to be available by 2014. If Japan decides to deploy the advanced version of the SM-3, in addition to the current version, theoretically, Japan would also have the capability to intercept a missile heading for the United States. Thus, the decision to deploy the advanced SM-3 version would rekindle the debate over Article 9. [7] Opposition to BMD in Japan remains significant, based primarily on the considerable cost of the system. [8] According to the Ministry of Defense, the missile defense program is estimated to cost between 800 billion yen ($7.4 billion) and one trillion yen ($8.9 billion) through 2012. However, since Japan plans to continue to pursue still more advanced technologies, costs are likely to increase well beyond this amount. [9] According to the Ministry of Defense, fiscal year 2007, because it was the first year of actual deployment, is expected to mark the greatest annual expenditure for missile defense to date – 186.3 billion yen ($1.7 billion).

<span class="Underline">Likewise, the political and security repercussions of Japanese nuclear weapon development would be very negative indeed. Most worrisome would the reaction of Japan’s neighboring countries. Japanese nuclear weapon development, even its intention were totally defensive, would be likely to invite caution and countermeasures from China, Russia, and South Korea even in its early stages. As a result, Japan might face a serious security problem before it succeeded in attaining the necessary SSBN/SLBM force. Although nuclear weapons, depending on their survivability and capability, can have a positive effect in helping prevent war among nuclear powers, Japan’s nuclearization may invite a serious security threat well before a strategically meaningful nuclear force can be built and deployed. Similarly, given that there are few international scenarios in which the United States benefits strategically and militarily from Japanese nuclear weapon development, a decision to develop indigenous nuclear weapons is likely to elicit a negative American response. Nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is one of the top priorities of the U.S. foreign policy agenda. More than this, considering that Japan has been the victim of U.S. nuclear attack and that Japan’s nuclearization would inevitably lead it to develop a sizable strategic nuclear force, it is unrealistic to believe that the United States would stand by and watch Japanese nuclearization. In addition, Japan suffers from a lack of the natural resources requisite for producing nuclear weapons. By concluding agreements with Australia, Britain, Canada, China, France, and the United States, Japan imports uranium ore and enriched uranium from these countries. Each of these agreements limits the use of imported uranium and nuclear materials to nonmilitary and peaceful purposes. A Japanese decision to use imported uranium for nuclear weapon development would certainly invite an embargo by the traditional suppliers. Unless Japan succeeds in making a fast breeder reactor fit for practical use and achieves a nuclear fuel cycle, such a halt of nuclear material imports would have a significant impact on the Japanese economy, considering that about 35 to 40 percent of all Japan’s electricity is generated by nuclear power. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Japanese Recession spreads globally, sparks wars </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Lopez 98 [Bernardo V., ‘Towards global recession,’ Business World, Lexis] </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> The current regional recession in Asia can easily spread to the entire globe if certain scenarios are realized. One scenario is war. War in Korea or Iraq, the two flashpoints, will temporarily pump prime the US economy with a windfall in the weapons industry, as it did in Desert Storm. But in the long term, war breaks economies rather than makes them since conflicts inhibit markets, trading, then production (especially for oil, the sine qua non of economies), and siphon money from productive peaceful use to destructive wartime use. A war in Iraq may trigger a second oil crisis which will create panic among stock markets and eventually lead not only to global recession but a deadly global depression. A war in Korea will negate any IMF bailout of South Korea and catalyze a deeper regional recession. Japan may be embroiled in that war, which may also cause deepening of its recession. A second scenario is the fall of a prime economy such as Japan, which recently saw the downtail of a major stock trader and a few small banks with it. Bailout in Japan is easy and the negative effects can still be contained. But the incident hints that powerful economies are not exempt from recession and are, in fact, at the forefront of recession since they lead the pack. A recession in Japan will deepen recession in Asia where Japan has invested billions of dollars in the last two decades, and eventually cause global recession. The role of China is crucial in global recession as it will catalyze or inhibit growth. A US-China confrontation, whe-ther economic or military, is the last straw. China and the US are actually the potential messiahs in global recession. A global recession will make the 1929 depression in the US look like a sari-sari store closing down. Global recession will lay off millions across the planet, and trigger a stoppage of production in all types of industries. Industry-based nations with little or no agrarian economy, such as Singapore, will be the first to feel the pinch. Moving out of recession takes time and while the crisis continues, despair will negate further efforts towards growth and induce more crimes and war. In other words, a protracted recession will make it harder to get out of it and may cause a depression. A global depression can kill more people at a shorter time than a protracted regional war. The IMF-World Bank bailout of beleaguered Asian economies, especially South Korea, is urgent since the ongoing regional recession may indeed spread out to affect even the more stable American economy. An American recession will surely trigger a global recession. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">It is not easy to predict Japan’s future path. The outlines of Japan’s security policy—the realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan, BMD, space development, and the demands of the business sector—were all established during the Bush-Koizumi era. The Obama and Hatoyama administrations might uphold this new status quo, or they might set off in very different directions. The Hatoyama government is, for now, buying time before making any major decisions on basic security policy. Under the previous government of Aso Taro, a report by an advisory panel to the prime minister on Japan’s future security was presented in June 2008. The key thrust of this panel was to change constitutional interpretation in order to allow the exercise of the right to collective self-defense. This report was essentially the supreme expression of the “defense reform” built by the Bush and Koizumi regimes. According to this plan, revision of the National Defense Program Guidelines and the Mid-Term Defense Program were also planned for the end of 2009. However, Prime Minister Hatoyama decided to postpone revision of defense policy by one year. He has also announced the establishment of a new panel of experts. Currently, the United States spends 42 percent of the $1.46 trillion dollars of annual global military expenditures, and East Asia is responsible for 13 percent. Furthermore, military expenditure in East Asia is increasing at a speed, which is pronounced even on an international scale. East Asia, home to an enormous U.S. military presence, is becoming the world’s largest weapons market. Japan has considerable latent potential to contribute to the freezing and reduction of regional, and global, military expenditures. Although Japan’s military expenditures remain quite high by global standards, Japan could set an important example for other countries by not increasing this amount and remaining within a standard of less than 1 percent of the GDP. The key issue is whether Japan will continue to develop high-tech military technology relating to BMD or not. The Japanese government and the Japanese public must answer a set of questions connected to these systems. Do they really function? What exactly is this system trying to protect, and from what? Is Japanese industry and technology just being mobilized in order to assume the place of U.S. defense? Is there a calm, efficient, and alternative method to removing the missile threat other than developing intercepting missiles? Toward Innovative Disarmament Cooperation Japanese and U.S. development of missile defense and related technology is clearly stimulating a backlash from China. This, in turn, helps China justify the modernization of its nuclear missile forces, leading to the promotion of a regional arms race and a worsening of the regional security environment. It is possible, through coordinated regional diplomacy and strengthened transparency and verification measures, to remove the nuclear and missile threats in a cooperative manner. Such an approach would increase confidence within the region, improve the security environment, ensure that regional resources are not being wastefully invested in military purposes, and bring us closer to building a sustainable peace in East Asia. To the extent that the realignment of U.S. forces reinforces U.S. regional and global power projection capabilities—rather than functioning as a cost-saving mechanism or as a means to enhance collective security—the backlash in Northeast Asia will be strengthened. If North Korea were to view the realignment of U.S. bases in Japan and South Korea as a threat, it will be less likely to follow through on denuclearization. If the relocation of U.S. bases leads to the construction of new bases within Japan or elsewhere, and increases expenses to that end, a key opportunity will have been lost. In order to serve the purpose of regional peace, the realignment of U.S. bases must be used to close redundant bases and promote their withdrawal. The new Hatoyama government is re-examining and trying to readjust the alliance with the United States in the name of “equal partnership” while also calling for the creation of an East Asia Community. Japan must not be misunderstood as reviving its early 20th-century ambitions for military hegemony in the region. The military spending issue can be a breakthrough for Japan, a way to show its commitment to peace while contributing to the construction of a new regional order. Japan should initiate negotiations with China and Korea toward a mutually coordinated freeze and reduction in military expenditure. Rather than abandoning its ties with the U.S. military industry, Japan should use the arms-export ban principle to negotiate and establish a regional framework to curb the arms trade and weapons proliferation. In 1967, Prime Minister Sato Eisaku introduced Japan’s Three Non-Nuclear Principles: not possessing, producing, or permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons. The Diet established these principles as national policy through a resolution in 1971. However, despite the “non-introduction” provision, considerable evidence indicates the existence of secret deals between the U.S. and Japanese government to allow the transit and port-calls of nuclear-weapons-equipped vessels, even since 1960. The Hatoyama government has established a commission to look into these secret deals. It is important to legalize these three principles to prevent a reintroduction of nuclear weapons into Japan. Legalizing the Non-Nuclear Principles will also create momentum for a nuclear weapon free zone in Northeast Asia that would, in turn, strengthen the nonproliferation regime in the region. Despite the advocacy of Keidanren, a concentrated investment in high-tech, military-civilian integrated technology would not lead to overall benefits for the Japanese economy. Such investments would have little economic effect for the vast majority of the Japanese labor force working in small or mid-size business. If Japan were to throw away its reputation as a “peaceful nation,” which it has maintained throughout the post-war era, the Japanese economy, so dependent on trade with Asia and the Middle East, would necessarily suffer. Instead of viewing the Self-Defense Forces as a way to boost employment, the Japanese government should establish an independent organization with straightforward humanitarian purposes such as disaster relief. Through exchange and humanitarian activities with and in neighboring countries, such an organization could reduce military expenditures and build regional confidence. The development of innovative cooperation for disarmament is now needed. At this critical juncture in history, only a cooperative-security approach can lead the way to the creation of a new order of peace. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">If the possibility existed of a mistaken preemption during and immediately after the Cold War, between the experienced nuclear forces and command systems of America and Russia, then it may be a matter of even more concern with regard to states with newer and more opaque forces and command systems. In addition, the Americans and Soviets (and then Russians) had a great deal of experience getting to know one another’s military operational proclivities and doctrinal idiosyncrasies, including those that might influence the decision for or against war. Another consideration, relative to nuclear stability in the present century, is that the Americans and their NATO allies shared with the Soviets and Russians a commonality of culture and historical experience. Future threats to American or Russian security from weapons of mass destruction may be presented by states or nonstate actors motivated by cultural and social predispositions not easily understood by those in theWest nor subject to favorable manipulation during a crisis. The spread of nuclear weapons in Asia presents a complicated mosaic of possibilities in this regard. States with nuclear forces of variable force structure, operational experience, and command-control systems will be thrown into a matrix of complex political, social, and cultural crosscurrents contributory to the possibility of war. In addition to the existing nuclear powers in Asia, others may seek nuclear weapons if they feel threatened by regional rivals or hostile alliances. Containment of nuclear proliferation in Asia is a desirable political objective for all of the obvious reasons. Nevertheless, the present century is unlikely to see the nuclear hesitancy or risk aversion that marked the ColdWar, in part, because the military and political discipline imposed by the Cold War superpowers no longer exists, but also because states in Asia have new aspirations for regional or global respect.12 The spread of ballistic missiles and other nuclear-capable delivery systems in Asia, or in the Middle East with reach into Asia, is especially dangerous because plausible adversaries live close together and are already engaged in ongoing disputes about territory or other issues.13 The Cold War Americans and Soviets required missiles and airborne delivery systems of intercontinental range to strike at one another’s vitals. But short-range ballistic missiles or fighter-bombers suffice for India and Pakistan to launch attacks at one another with potentially “strategic” effects. China shares borders with Russia, North Korea, India, and Pakistan; Russia, with China and NorthKorea; India, with Pakistan and China; Pakistan, with India and China; and so on. The short flight times of ballistic missiles between the cities or military forces of contiguous states means that very little time will be available for warning and attack assessment by the defender. Conventionally armed missiles could easily be mistaken for a tactical nuclear first use. Fighter-bombers appearing over the horizon could just as easily be carrying nuclear weapons as conventional ordnance. In addition to the challenges posed by shorter flight times and uncertain weapons loads, potential victims of nuclear attack in Asia may Nuclear Crisis Stability in Future Asia 121 also have first strike–vulnerable forces and command-control systems that increase decision pressures for rapid, and possibly mistaken, retaliation. This potpourri of possibilities challenges conventional wisdom about nuclear deterrence and proliferation on the part of policymakers and academic theorists. For policymakers in the United States and NATO, spreading nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in Asia could profoundly shift the geopolitics of mass destruction from a European center of gravity (in the twentieth century) to an Asian and/or Middle Eastern center of gravity (in the present century).14 This would profoundly shake up prognostications to the effect that wars of mass destruction are now passe, on account of the emergence of the “Revolution in Military Affairs” and its encouragement of information-based warfare.15 Together with this, there has emerged the argument that large-scale war between states or coalitions of states, as opposed to varieties of unconventional warfare and failed states, are exceptional and potentially obsolete.16 The spread ofWMDand ballistic missiles in Asia could overturn these expectations for the obsolescence or marginalization of major interstate warfare. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Further, the large number of states that became capable of building nuclear weapons over the years, but chose not to, can be reasonably well explained by the fact that most were formally allied with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Both these superpowers had strong nuclear forces and put great pressure on their allies not to build nuclear weapons. Since the Cold War, the US has retained all its allies. In addition, NATO has extended its protection to some of the previous allies of the Soviet Union and plans on taking in more. Nuclear proliferation by India and Pakistan, and proliferation programmes by North Korea, Iran and Iraq, all involve states in the opposite situation: all judged that they faced serious military opposition and had little prospect of establishing a reliable supporting alliance with a suitably strong, nuclear-armed state. What would await the world if strong protectors, especially the United States, were [was] no longer seen as willing to protect states from nuclear-backed aggression? At least a few additional states would begin to build their own nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them to distant targets, and these initiatives would spur increasing numbers of the world’s capable states to follow suit. Restraint would seem ever less necessary and ever more dangerous. Meanwhile, more states are becoming capable of building nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. Many, perhaps most, of the world’s states are becoming sufficiently wealthy, and the technology for building nuclear forces continues to improve and spread. Finally, it seems highly likely that at some point, halting proliferation will come to be seen as a lost cause and the restraints on it will disappear. Once that happens, the transition to a highly proliferated world would probably be very rapid. While some regions might be able to hold the line for a time, the threats posed by wildfire proliferation in most other areas could create pressures that would finally overcome all restraint. Many readers are probably willing to accept that nuclear proliferation is such a grave threat to world peace that every effort should be made to avoid it. However, every effort has not been made in the past, and we are talking about much more substantial efforts now. For new and substantially more burdensome efforts to be made to slow or stop nuclear proliferation, it needs to be established that the highly proliferated nuclear world that would sooner or later evolve without such efforts is not going to be acceptable. And, for many reasons, it is not. First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous. Proliferating states will feel great pressures to obtain nuclear weapons and delivery systems before any potential opponent does. Those who succeed in outracing an opponent may consider preemptive nuclear war before the opponent becomes capable of nuclear retaliation. Those who lag behind might try to preempt their opponent’s nuclear programme or defeat the opponent using conventional forces. And those who feel threatened but are incapable of building nuclear weapons may still be able to join in this arms race by building other types of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological weapons. [The article continues…] The war between Iran and Iraq during the 1980s led to the use of chemical weapons on both sides and exchanges of missiles against each other’s cities. And more recently, violence in the Middle East escalated in a few months from rocks and small arms to heavy weapons on one side, and from police actions to air strikes and armoured attacks on the other. Escalation of violence is also basic human nature. Once the violence starts, retaliatory exchanges of violent acts can escalate to levels unimagined by the participants before hand. Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse. And such anger can lead us to impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible. In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possible with the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild West of the late 1800s. With most, if not all, nations wearing nuclear 'six-shooters' on their hips, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations, . </span><br />

<span class="Underline">When assessing the Japan-U.S. TMD project, citizens interested in government accountability and nuclear safety would do well to put stock in the old aphorism: you can’t judge a book by its cover. If historical trends continue, there is good reason to expect that the official discourse on Japanese TMD will cover up technical failure and disguise politically unpopular missions planned for any joint Japan-U.S. system. There are several negative consequences that could result from such deception. One end result of a politically motivated decision to pursue Japanese TMD, based on doctored scientific data, could be deployment of a deeply flawed missile defense system that is technically bankrupt, yet has an illusory veneer of effectiveness. In addition to the fact that such a fraudulent scheme would sacrifice huge amounts of taxpayer funds at the altar of corporate profit, such a development would present profound security risks of its own. Consider that missile defense advocates point to the possibility of “rogue state blackmail” as an emerging threat justifying rapid pursuit of missile defense. This blackmail scenario envisages major powers embroiled in a diplomatic or military dispute where a socalled state of concern (e.g. North Korea, Iran or Iraq—armed with weapons of mass destruction [WMD]) attempts to exact concessions from wealthy states, by threatening their homelands with long-range rocket attack. 45 In such a tragic situation, it is suggested that missile defense would preserve “freedom of movement” to call the state of concern’s bluff. To do this, however, leaders of shielded nations would need to have supreme confidence in their missile defense systems. If such confidence was based on faulty or doctored feasibility data, the stage could be set for a miscalculation of tragic proportions. For example, misplaced faith in a leaky missile defense shield could mistakenly embolden a Japanese president to take diplomatic risks that would recklessly expose thousands (perhaps millions) of civilians to nuclear, chemical, or biological attack. 46 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community. At worst, there is the possibility of nuclear attack1, whether by intention, miscalculation, or merely accident, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions. But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow...The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger...To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4 These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. The direct impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis pale by comparison. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Under the current Japanese government's interpretation of Article 9 of its Constitution, Japan's participation in collective self-defense is prohibited, as is using missile defense capabilities to defend a third country--even an ally such as the United States. Therefore, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a strong advocate of changing Article 9, formed the Council on Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security in April 2007 to provide recommendations on the right of collective self-defense. &quot;Whether it is appropriate for Japan to use its missile defense to intercept ballistic missiles targeting the United States&quot; was one of four scenarios he tasked the council to answer. The council was supposed to submit recommendations to the Cabinet by September 2007, but after the devastating defeat of Abe's ruling party in the upper house election in July 2007 and his abrupt resignation two months later, the council's members delayed making their recommendations. Abe's successor, Yasuo Fukuda, wasn't as enthusiastic about changing the constitutional interpretation. So even though the council submitted its recommendations stating that Japan should have the right to exercise collective self-defense last June, nothing has changed. Taro Aso, the country's third prime minister in two years, is more supportive of the right to collective self-defense, which might revitalize debate over the issue. Technologically, Japan currently doesn't have the capability to shoot down a missile heading toward the United States even if it legally could. But the two countries are currently developing SM-3 Block II A missiles that could potentially intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles. (See &quot;Japan Test Fires Its First Raytheon-Built Standard Missile-3.&quot;) As technological capabilities improve to intercept long-range ballistic missiles, the argument that Japan isn't allowed by its constitutional interpretation to shoot down a missile heading toward the United States might be perceived as unacceptable. Technical limitations. Although both the Japanese and U.S. governments have highlighted successful flight tests, all flight intercept tests have been conducted under highly structured conditions with information about the missile attack. In a real missile launch, it's highly unlikely that the launch location, timing of launch, and flight trajectories will be known, making it almost impossible to predict the percentage of success of an intercept in a real-world attack.

<span class="Underline">The fact that Japanese leaders have already shown a proclivity to extol TMD’s “purely defensive” qualities is evidence that any American export of missile defense to Japan will likely include not only technology, but also accompanying rhetorical strategies designed to politically safeguard such hardware in the crucible of public debate. As discussed earlier, missile defense advocates used Reagan’s suggestion that Star Wars could render nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete” to co-opt the rhetorical high ground occupied by the disarmament left. Tests were rigged and scientific processes manipulated to buoy the political fortunes of the Star Wars, Patriot, THAAD, and NMD programs. Further, the actual purposes of the Timberwind and NMD programs were covered up in attempts to hide politically unpopular aspects of such initiatives. Perhaps these episodes of strategic deception in U.S. missile defense advocacy would be easier to excuse if they were conducted by “rogue” scientists who broke the law for profit or fame. But CIA defense guidance documents, internal DOD directives, and presidential National Security Decision Directives reveal that during the Reagan Star Wars era, strategic deception was not only legally authorized, but also officially mandated, as part of the public relations campaign to promote missile defense.69 Although Japanese leaders greeted American Star Wars-era missile defense overtures with skepticism, the 1998 launch of a Taepodong missile by North Korea over Japan galvanized political support for TMD in Japan and led eventually to the inking of the August 1999 MOU between Japan and the U.S. Unfortunately, the same threatening environment that drives support for missile defense also provides rationales for public officials to ratchet up secrecy and dodge public accountability, with the explanation that full disclosure of the nature of TMD plans and their lack of scientific basis would give comfort to the enemy. However, this preemption of public debate introduces its own set of security concerns. Excessive secrecy locks in Cold War patterns of public discourse, where defense officials and industry representatives monopolize arguments, sealing their positions with the unassailable proof of classified evidence. Threat assessments drift toward worst-case scenarios generated from simulation and speculation, rather than more sober appraisals of foreign military capabilities and intentions. Military officials who see the idea of public debate as a superfluous luxury skirt critical arguments, removing issues of grave national importance from arenas of democratic deliberation. With these patterns of public argument structuring official missile defense discourse in the U.S. during the past two decades, American citizens have been coaxed to spend billions of dollars for doctored scientific experiments that cover up the technical flaws of ill-conceived BMD initiatives. The recent Japan-U.S. MOU on joint missile defense research clears the way for such strategies to be exported to Japanese public spheres. Export of these patterns of public argument to Japan could potentially produce tragic consequences. Profit-hungry aerospace companies, working with government scientists well-schooled in the art of technical deception, could swell political momentum for deployment of a TMD system that appears flawless, yet is riddled with systemic deficiencies that may only come to light in combat situations. This outcome my rockets in future conflicts, when in fact their level of vulnerability to missile strikes would be much greater than believed. could invite catastrophic miscalculations in Japanese foreign policy. False confidence in a seemingly impenetrable TMD shield could prompt Japan’s leaders to expect their nation to be protected from ene One shudders at the prospect that such a discrepancy between actual and perceived effectiveness of a Japanese TMD system would be brought to light by an actual ICBM launch on a Japanese city. Yet this is precisely the scenario that would seem possible if Japanese leaders embrace the American suggestion that missile defense can be a potent tool of diplomacy in scenarios of rogue state blackmail. In such situations, rather than yielding ground in a diplomatic stalemate, shielded nations would dare a rogue state (or state of concern) to follow through on their promise to launch an ICBM. Bluffing poker players who are forced to show their poor cards after a called bet often lose the hand. Presidents bluffing about the capability of their missile defense systems could lose entire cities. Some missile defense proponents maintain that even if a missile shield doesn’t work, cultivating the perception that it does can accomplish important diplomatic aims. On this logic, missile defenses work symbolically like medical placebos.70 For example, adherents of the “Reagan victory school” of history believe that the illusion of Star Wars’ effectiveness sped up collapse of the Soviet Union and helped deliver Cold War victory to the U.S.71 According to this reasoning, although Star Wars was a scientific bust, it nevertheless tricked Soviet leaders into spending millions of rubles in response, bankrupting the Soviet economy and forcing Soviet negotiators to make concessions in arms control negotiations.72 Today, a corollary of this strategy has appeared in the suggestion that a Japanese TMD could have similar effects on China. Some say that while TMD may be useless, it may be a useful tool of diplomatic negotiations. They reason that even though the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), also known as the Star Wars project, was impractical despite its enormous research cost, it was useful to push the Soviet Union into concession in U.S.-Soviet summit talks. By the same token, they say, TMD can also be used to obtain Chinese concessions.73 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Toki 3/1 [Japan's Defense Guidelines: New Conventional Strategy, Same Old Nuclear Dilemma Author: Masako Toki, Project Manager and Research Associate [1] Monterey Institute for International Studies James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies March 1, 2011] hn </span><br />
<span class="Underline">For the first time in fifty years, Japan experienced a governing party shift when the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) defeated the incumbent Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) by a landslide on 30 August 2009. Prior to the election, the LDP had been in the process of preparing the NDPG, which were presumed to include a more assertive security policy than past documents. How the political power shift would affect the formation of the new NDPG drew much attention, as the newly elected DPJ restarted the process and delayed the guidelines' release by a year. However, the major changes in Japan's security strategy stipulated in the December 2010 NDPG were not the result of this internal political power shift, and were likely consistent in most respects with the former governing party's planned NDPG. The new NDPG represented a proactive response by Tokyo to pressing external threats, including China's rising military power and growing maritime activities, and North Korea's ongoing and intensifying provocations, including nuclear and missile developments. Tokyo expressed concern over China's military modernization in stronger terms than in the previous NDPG: &quot;these movements, coupled with the lack of transparency in its military and security matters, have become a matter of concern for the region and the international community.&quot;[4] As a result, Japan will increase the number of its submarines to 22 from 16, and shift its defense focus from the north (former Soviet threat), to the southwest, where Japan shares a maritime border with China.[5] Also, in response primarily to North Korea's missile and nuclear threats, Tokyo will continue to develop its missile defense systems in cooperation with the United States.[6] Reacting to Japan's more conspicuous statement of concern over China's military rise, Beijing condemned Tokyo's view as irresponsible. China has also warned that the construction by Japan and the United States of a more robust missile defense system in the region would threaten the balance of power and escalate the arms race in Asia, forcing Beijing to reciprocally enhance its own military capabilities.[7] After North Korea's 1998 Taepodong-1 missile test, Japan began undertaking missile defense R&amp;D in cooperation with the United States. In December 2003, the Japanese government decided to acquire ballistic missile defense capabilities.[8] The former governing Liberal Democratic Party argued that missile defense did not contradict Japan's &quot;exclusively defensive defense&quot; policy. Therefore, when the December 2004 NDPG were issued, Tokyo decided to make the U.S.-Japanese missile defense programs exceptions to Japan's decades old self-imposed Three Principles on Arms Export.[9] The &quot;Three Principles,&quot; a hallmark of Japan's post-World War II pacifism policy, had long prohibited Tokyo from jointly developing and producing weapons, or transferring weapons parts to foreign countries, including the United States. Furthermore, in December 2005, the Japanese cabinet decided that Tokyo would jointly develop more advanced next-generation missile interceptors with the United States, and reconfirmed that the Three Principles would not apply to the joint development of missile defense systems under strict conditions.[10] Tokyo has since deployed a multilayered missile defense system consisting of sea-based midcourse missile defense (the Aegis ballistic missile defense system); and ground-based terminal phase missile defense (Patriot Advanced Capabilities-3, or PAC-3). When the DPJ came to power in September 2009, however, many speculated that government support for missile defense might be diminished given that the DPJ seemed more skeptical of missile defense than its predecessor. For example, in November 2009, then DPJ Foreign Minister Okada insisted that the government should be able to thoroughly explain to the public the value of the expensive missile defense system that Japan had developed with the United States. When the DPJ cabinet approved defense spending guidelines for FY2010 in December 2009, it suspended new funds for any further PAC-3 deployment until at least April 2011.[11] Events in 2010 however, including provocative North Korean behavior and heightened tensions with China, caused the DPJ government to decide to continue to develop and improve missile defense in cooperation with the United States. Specifically, Tokyo decided to enhance the performance of the Aegis system, and will increase the number of Aegis-equipped destroyers from four to six. It will also deploy more PAC-3 interceptor missiles across Japan to counter the North Korean ballistic missile threat. In addition to the three air defense missile groups in Japan, three more missile groups will also be deployed with the PAC-3 interceptors, covering all of the major Japanese islands.[12] The Ministry of Defense also decided to relocate missile defense command from Japan's Self-Defense Force Facility to a U.S. airbase to improve its speed of detection, and response to incoming missiles identified by U.S. early-warning satellites.[13] The United States and Japan have been jointly developing the next generation Standard Missile 3 Block II A interceptor, and the United States plans to deploy this system in Europe and elsewhere, with the aim of fielding a comprehensive missile defense system by around 2020. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency is pressuring Japan to ease its arms export ban so that the SM-3 Block II A currently under co-development by Mitsubishi Heavy Industry and Raytheon can be transferred to third countries.[14] While Japan's agreement is required for the United States to export the jointly developed system to third countries, Tokyo cannot currently accede to the U.S. request under the &quot;Three Principles&quot; of arms export. The Japanese government must therefore decide by the end of 2011 whether or not to further modify the Three Principles. While this was a significant focus of debate in the preparation of the new NDPG, it remains unresolved.[15] Pressure from the business sector and the United States, as well as Defense Minister Kitazawa's support for easing the Three Principles, increased the prospect that the new NDPG might include a provision easing the three principles.[16] An expert panel, &quot;the Council on Security and Defense Capabilities in the New Era,&quot; formed to prepare the new NDPG. In its final report, the panel suggested that Japan should ease its arms export ban, stating that &quot;With a careful design to contribute to international peace and improvement of Japan's security environment, it should revise the current arms export prohibition policy.&quot;[17] Furthermore, in July 2010 Nippon Keidanren, Japan's business federation and the most influential lobby in the country's economic policy, submitted the &quot;Proposal for the New National Defense Program Guidelines,&quot; suggesting that &quot;the Government should establish new arms export control principles to replace the current Three Principles on Arms Exports, etc.&quot;[18] However, the new NDPG did not make any direct reference to reviewing the Three Principles, in view of the adamant opposition from the Social Democratic Party, whose support is needed for the DPJ to pass its FY2011 budget.[19] Instead, the new NDPG left the door open toward a possible lifting of the weapons export ban, calling for measures to deal with &quot;major changes&quot; in the global environment involving weapons.[20] Despite delays with regard to modifying the Three Principles, the new NDPG and the current government's overall stance on defense issues suggest that Japan is transforming its strategic orientation from a reactive post-World War II defense orientation to a more proactive defense posture. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS RUSHING TOWARD EARLY deployment of a limited national missile defense system. If it cannot get the Russians to endorse a revision of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, it threatens to go ahead unilaterally, ending the treaty altogether. Although the Bush administration has focused on Russia, it began last summer to pay more attention to Chinese concerns; it says it will consult with China on the matter. In China, U.S. plans for national missile defense are not just a topic for security experts. It is a matter of wide concern. A search for “NMD” on the Internet in China, including the mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, yields about as many web sites as those devoted to McDonald’s restaurants. (And in China, the fast food chain’s influence is a hot topic.) About 90 percent of the web pages on the mainland and an even larger proportion in Taiwan and Hong Kong use the English acronym “NMD” rather than its Chinese translation, which indicates that national missile defense is still regarded as a foreign concept. China will have to respond By Li Bin, Zhou Baogen, and Liu Zhiwei Li Bin is director of the Arms Control Program at the Institute of International Studies, Tsinghua University, Beijing (libin@tsinghua.edu.cn). Zhou Baogen and Liu Zhiwei are graduate students in the program.The Chinese people generally believe that a U.S. national missile defense system is a bad idea. That feeling extends to Taiwan also, where some Taiwanese experts have suggested that national missile defense could have negative effects on international security. A U.S. trick? The primary concern in China is that a U.S. national missile defense system could negate the Chinese nuclear deterrent. Some believe that the main purpose of the American plan is to do just that. Even the limited system described by the Bush administration could potentially achieve that goal. If the United States ever came to feel that it could disarm the Chinese nuclear retaliatory capability, the United States might become much less likely to adopt a cooperative approach in resolving disputes with China. China does not want to waste resources on a nuclear arms race triggered by a U.S. national missile defense scheme. China is determined to focus on economic development—and that requires an environment free of major tension among the great powers. In fact, some Chinese scholars believe that national missile defense is actually a trick to bring China into an arms race that would exhaust its resources and harm its economic development. People who claim this do not necessarily believe that national missile defense is technically possible. The important point is not whether it would work; the only requirement is that it cause China to spend a lot of money in building up its deterrent forces, money that could have been used to improve life in China. They argue that the collapse of the Soviet Union was largely caused by President Ronald Reagan’s hugely expensive military buildup and Strategic Defense Initiative, or “Star Wars.” The Soviet Union could not compete in that new game. In Western terms, it went bankrupt. These scholars suggest that the United States is now trying to use the same strategy in an effort to “contain” China. A related concern: In the past, a major Chinese worry regarding U.S. national missile defense was that it would provoke a response—a nuclear and missile buildup by other countries. Russia, for example, might halt reductions in its nuclear stockpile. (According to treaty reservations adopted by the Russian Duma when it ratified START II, the Putin government would be required to do just that.) A new worry in China is that U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty would also shatter a psychological baseline; it would signal an American intention to abandon other arms control efforts. It is no secret that many high-level members of the Bush administration have little regard for the arms control process. If the United States abandons arms control, other countries would do likewise. Where is the threat? Many technical people in China do not consider national missile defense as truly feasible. But they worry that unexpected technological breakthroughs might occur, further enhancing U.S. predominance in military technology. Long-range precision weapons with conventional warheads, for instance, could benefit from further development of guidance technology, detection technology, and computer technology as national missile defense research proceeds. Such long-range precision weapons with conventional warheads would be distinctly destabilizing because they could be used as a first strike against strategic nuclear weapons. In Taiwan, some scholars worry that the dispute between mainland China and the United States over national missile defense could put Taiwan in an even more precarious position. They suggest that Taiwanese authorities use great caution in responding to U.S. plans for national missile defense. A few Taiwanese researchers suggest that Taiwan might even play the national missile defense card in exchange for the mainland’s tolerance of some theater missile defense for Taiwan. Beyond the Taiwan issue, which is always difficult, 26 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists November/December 2001some Chinese researchers worry that deployment of a national missile defense system would steadily increase tensions between Beijing and Washington. A national missile defense system makes little sense if there is no credible threat. In fact, the current “states of concern,” principally North Korea and Iraq, do not seem to constitute realistic threats. Many scholars do not believe that they have—or are likely to have in the future— the capability to deliver weapons of mass destruction to the United States by long-range missiles. The Clinton and Bush administrations have repeatedly said that China is not the reason for considering a national missile defense system, except in the case of accidental launch. If it is clearly proved that “states of concern” will not pose a long-range missile threat against the U.S. homeland, or that the threat, if any, could be addressed by diplomatic approaches or by a more geographically limited defense, we expect some American experts and government officials to cite the “China threat” as the best reason to continue pouring money into a very expensive enterprise. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">1) Nationalism </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Japan TMD viewed as Taiwan deterrent- even without intent, Chinese fear Taiwan emboldenment </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Kiziah, Professor at US Air Force Academy, 2k [Rex, Lt. Col. USAF, US-Led Cooperative Theater Missile Defense in Northeast Asia, Air War College, Scholar] </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Perhaps the most important complicating issue between the United States, China, and Japan with respect to the current US-Japanese plans for cooperative TMD development is China’s view of this effort with respect to Taiwan. Ultimately, the Chinese leadership would like to regain control of what it considers to be a renegade province. For 20 THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE China, unification with Taiwan is a cherished national goal. In the past China’s leaders have threatened the use of force if Taiwan formally declared independence, a Chinese government white paper released in February 2000 broadened the reasons that Beijing considered would justify the use of military force—specifically, “if Taiwan’s authorities refused indefinitely ‘the peaceful settlement of cross-Straits reunification through negotiations.’ ”56 Believing that a US-Japan TMD system will also be clearly designed to counter China’s ballistic missiles, then it would eliminate Beijing’s only credible military option to bring Taipei to the negotiating table on China’s terms. Reinforcing this belief is the joint US-Japanese decision to pursue R&amp;D on an upper-tier, NTW-like TMD system. Such a ship-based system would have wide-area defensive coverage and be highly mobile; it could therefore be moved quickly to thwart Chinese actions against Taiwan. The Chinese argue that, even if there is no US or Japanese intent at the present time to use a missile defense system to protect Taiwan in the event of a cross-strait crisis, a shipbased TMD system will clearly provide the United States and Japan such a capability which they may then choose to use. Furthermore, based on extensive interviews conducted in 1996 and 1998 with military and civilian analysts in Chinese government think tanks and academicians at leading Chinese institutions, Christensen concludes that Chinese officials view the Japanese as more likely than the United States to oppose Taiwan’s reintegration with the mainland. Christensen supports his conclusion with the following: Taiwan is a former Japanese colony (1895–1945). It is near international sea-lanes that are important to Japan. In addition, . . . Japan has a strategic interest in preventing Taiwan’s high-technology and capital-rich economy from linking politically with the mainland. Moreover, some Chinese analysts view Taiwan as having geostrategic significance for Japan as a potential ally because of its location near the Chinese mainland.57 Perhaps of even greater concern to Beijing than the use of missile defenses by the United States or Japan in a possible future China-Taiwan contingency is that defensive weapons, such as a TMD system, deployed by Taiwan’s allies and friends may bolster Taiwanese leadership’s confiKIZIAH 21 dence to declare permanent independence from China.58 Preventing Taiwan from legitimizing the current territorial status quo, that is, de facto independence, is a high-priority Chinese security goal as evidenced by their ever increasing coastal ballistic missile deployments near Taiwan and their frequent veiled threats indicating a willingness to risk war to prevent others from intervening in their internal affairs. And Beijing’s concerns and rhetoric do not appear to be diminished by the US’s “three no’s” policy that includes no support for Taiwan’s independence </span><br />

<span class="Underline">China is another matter...a nuclear holocaust. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">China is another matter. No sane figure in the Pentagon wants a war with China, and all serious US militarists know that China's minuscule nuclear capacity is not offensive but a deterrent against the overwhelming US power arrayed against it (twenty archaic Chinese warheads versus more than 7,000 US warheads). Taiwan, whose status constitutes the still incomplete last act of the Chinese civil war, remains the most dangerous place on earth. Much as the 1914 assassination of the Austrian crown prince in Sarajevo led to a war that no one wanted, a misstep in Taiwan by any side could bring the United States and China into a conflict that neither wants. Such a war would bankrupt the United States, deeply divide Japan and probably end in a Chinese victory, given that China is the world's most populous country and would be defending itself against a foreign aggressor. More seriously, it could easily escalate into a nuclear holocaust. Since any Taiwanese attempt to declare its independence formally would be viewed as a challenge to China's sovereignty, forward-deployed US forces on China's borders have virtually no deterrent effect. The United States uses satellites to observe changes in China's basic military capabilities. But the coastal surveillance flights by our twelve (now eleven) EP-3E Aries II spy planes, like the one that was forced down off Hainan Island, seek information that is useful only in an imminent battle. They are inherently provocative and inappropriate when used to monitor a country with which we are at peace. The United States itself maintains a 200-mile area off its coasts in which it intercepts any aircraft attempting similar reconnaissance. America's provocative military posture in East Asia makes war with China more likely because it legitimizes military strategies in both Beijing and Taipei as well as in Washington and Tokyo. Although the spy-plane incident may have provoked new caution in a few Taiwanese who fear becoming the battleground in a China-US war, it also emboldens those who advocate independence from China to continue fostering Chinese-American conflict as a cover for their own aspirations. Former President Lee Teng-hui's controversial visits to both Japan and the United States may be an attempt to do precisely that. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Recently, some Chinese scholars have expressed concerns that even if U.S. missile defense and conventional global strike systems have little or no real impact on China’s assured second strike capability, they may still give U.S. planners and decision-makers a false sense of superiority, potentially leading to U.S. attempts to coerce China with nuclear threats in a crisis. For example, according to Li Bin and Nie Hongyi, “even though the missile defense system cannot be relied upon in actual warfare it may lead American decision-makers to misjudge by causing them to imagine they already have a more powerful strategic advantage, thus leading them to blindly adopt a nuclear coercion policy” [7]. Similarly, they raise the possibility that even the illusion of “nuclear primacy” could lead to more aggressive behavior on the part of the United States: “some American scholars believe the United States can already rely on a preemptive nuclear strike to completely destroy China’s long-range nuclear weapons, and therefore they maintain that the United States already has the capital to carry out nuclear coercion against China” [8]. The 2010 NPR should help to alleviate some of these concerns. The NPR also identifies China as an important partner in pursuit of nonproliferation and arms control goals in the short- and long-term, stating that strategic stability will facilitate pursuit of these broader policy objectives [9]. Nonproliferation and preventing nuclear terrorism were high on the agenda when Chinese President Hu Jintao arrived at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington last week, but the time is not yet ripe for arms control talks with China, especially given Beijing’s unwillingness to engage in the process at least until U.S. and Russian forces reach lower levels. According to Hui Zhang, “Given the huge qualitative and quantitative gap between the Chinese arsenal and those of the United States and Russia, however, Beijing cannot be expected to involve itself directly in the reduction of its nuclear weapons until the United States and Russia have made deeper cuts in their arsenals” [10]. Yet China’s integration into the global nuclear reduction process that President Obama outlined in his 2009 Prague speech will eventually be required to move toward the long-term goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. The NPR reflects this challenge, stating, “over time” the United States “will also engage with other nuclear weapon states, including China, on ways to expand the nuclear reduction process in the future” [11]. It is unclear at what point China would be prepared to engage in this process. As Hui notes, “Beijing does not yet appear to have worked out a detailed set of preconditions, including a specific number that the United States and Russia must cut, before it joins the process” [12]. All of these challenges underscore the importance of strategic dialogue between the United States and China to enhance strategic stability and promote cooperation on non-proliferation and arms control issues. Strategic Dialogue These emerging dynamics within the U.S.-China strategic relationship thus underscore the need for further enhancement of U.S.-China dialogue and engagement on strategic stability and nuclear weapons issues. This is especially important as the United States continues to draw down its nuclear forces. According to the NPR: “It is also clear that maintaining strategic stability at reduced force levels will be an enduring and evolving challenge for the United States in the years ahead. Ongoing nuclear and other military modernization efforts by Russia and China compound this challenge, making the need for strategic stability dialogues all the more critical” [13]. The United States thus plans to pursue bilateral dialogues on strategic stability to promote “stable, resilient and transparent strategic relationships” [14]. According to the NPR: “With China, the purpose of a dialogue on strategic stability is to provide a venue and mechanism for each side to communicate its views about the other’s strategies, policies, and programs on nuclear weapons and other strategic capabilities. The goal of such a dialogue is to enhance confidence, improve transparency, and reduce mistrust” [15]. Chinese scholars and military personnel also recognize the potential value of expanding and enhancing dialogue on strategic security issues. As Li and Nie acknowledge, for example, “The establishment of China-U.S. mutual confidence in the area of nuclear weapons can eliminate suspicion and reduce negative interactive side effects of both sides.” At the same time, however, China’s persistent concerns about what it sees as the potential risks of greater transparency may limit its willingness to engage with the United States. China has long worried that revealing too much would expose its vulnerabilities in ways that could undermine the credibility of its strategic deterrent. Although China has been reluctant to increase transparency in part because of the relative weakness of its position, the modernization of the Second Artillery’s nuclear missile force appears to be fostering greater confidence in China’s assured second strike capability. For example, according to a professor from the Second Artillery Command Academy, because of its range and mobility, the DF-31A ICBM “basically can carry out effective nuclear counterattack operations” against a country that launches a nuclear strike against China (Global Times Network, January 27). This greater confidence in turn should eventually lead to greater willingness to increase strategic transparency. The United States, for its part, should concentrate on accelerating this process by persuading China that increasing transparency would not undermine Chinese interests, but would instead benefit both sides by helping to promote shared strategic stability and national security interests. Nonetheless, the United States may find it very difficult to overcome China’s longstanding concerns. Indeed, some Chinese scholars have cautioned that uncertainty about future technological developments may result in even greater anxiety about nuclear transparency [16]. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Once the new triad concept was produced in 2001, Washington has firmly committed itself to development of the conventional parts of this tool. From the defensive point of view, the Missile Defense program has seen many technical and operational developments. Apart from the deployment of the first interceptor sites on the West coast, the naval component (Sea-Based Midcourse System) appears to be the most advanced, particularly due to the commitment by several of the United States’ allies to the acquisition or construction of AEGIS type ships that could eventually be integrated into a single command network, thus multiplying interception capacities of the system. This network concept forms the main internationalization vector of the new triad. The command system currently being developed for the MD structures all available warning, flight path mapping and interception means in an engagement control and planning tool that is essential for the operation of American and allied means. This is particularly the case because the command architecture selected by the United States that places regional commands at the heart of the engagement process but centralizes coordination in STRATCOM, encourages progressive merging of allied antimissiles defense means in a single command system. Furthermore, this single command system should eventually be integrated into a broader network including all conventional s y s t e m s in the new triad. This merging will be necessary due to the need to coordinate offensive and defensive components, and means of providing intelligence and compilation of information with which they are related so as to achieve the counter proliferation and deterrence objectives fixed by American reference documents – NPR, QDR and national strategy for resistance to proliferation. Thus, countries that had been connected to the command network as part of their participation to Missile Defense should de facto be committed to the process for planning and commitment of offensive conventional means of the new triad. With Washington, they should determine the degree and operational conditions of this integration, if applicable including defining how their own offensive systems could be made to participate in American counter-proliferation missions. Apart from missile defense capabilities, they should be based on the development of the Prompt Global Strike (PGS) project, the objective of which is to be able to neutralize any target in the world in a few minutes. To achieve this, Washington would need a tailored intelligence capacity both to detect and locate objects, sites or persons and to quickly verify whether they have been satisfactorily neutralized. This involves the development of new information compilation tools (for example means introduced clandestinely on a site), and the existence of a highly reactive decision system. At the other end of the spectrum, the United States should have a few very precise missiles capable of reaching their target in a few minutes. Conversion of strategic ballistic missiles appears to be the easiest and the least expensive solution for satisfying this mission. This is the case particularly because American forces initiated research work in the 1990s so as to develop conventional warheads for their ballistic missiles (Trident, Minuteman or Peacekeeper). With conversion and development costs equal to a few hundred million dollars, the United States could have a few tens of system capable of satisfying the need by the end of the decade. However, the development, deployment and use of these systems face strategic problems that the United States must take into account, since they are missiles that were used by nuclear forces. Although legal constraints are minimal, particularly due to the end of obligations agreed upon within the START framework, the main concern applies to the possibility of a missile of this type being fired and interpreted by Russia, and to a lesser extent by China, as a sign of a first nuclear strike. Although several elements actually limit this risk, it must nevertheless be taken into account to prevent potentially dramatic consequences. Initially, co-location of conventional and nuclear forces should be avoided, since it increases this risk. Thus, Washington should consider conversion of these missiles based on land (Minuteman and/or Peacekeeper) in priority, in preference to missiles fired from submarines (Trident). However, it should be emphasized that in the state of the American project, the conversion of a few missiles should not have any negative effect on Russia’s or China's deterrence capacities due to reorganization efforts made by the Russian government and modernization efforts made by the Chinese government. Apart from the production of national systems designed to further reduce the possibility of erroneous interpretation, the United States' priority should be to set up firstly with Russia, a new framework designed to increase transparency of its conventional and nuclear strategic arsenal, in order to replace the START treaty. A new agreement should not be sought in order to further reduce the number of weapons possessed by the two parties, but instead firstly to produce measures capable of verifying the 2002 agreement on reduction of strategic arsenals (SORT), and secondly to produce verifiable technical and functional measures designed to eliminate any ambiguity about the United States use of its offensive strategic capacities. In order to operate, they should take account of technical and operational measures taken by Washington in the short term to limit risks of erroneous interpretation (geographic separation of firing platforms, adapted paths, warheads with specific signatures). Modern communication tools that enable both parties to exchange data (and notifications) in quasi real time, should be envisaged to increase the transparency of use of their conventional means, but also to enable the United States to use their PGS capacity reactively. In the longer term, this agreement could be extended to include related problems but with an influence on the strategic postures of the two States; tactical nuclear weapons, antimissile defenses, deterrence concepts (particularly de-alerting). In the present state, the objective is not a progressive reduction on alert levels of the two arsenals. If there is no risk at this stage due to the possibility of seeing China respond to the use of conventional strikes with its nuclear forces (unless these strikes are aimed at Chinese targets), changes in the nuclear posture of the Popular Republic are possible and could create such a possibility. Several factors could lead to the Chinese second strike concept being abandoned, particularly due to the qualitative and quantitative increase in Chinese ballistic capacities. Therefore, it would appear essential that Washington should plan to reach transparency agreements with Beijing of the same type as would be negotiated with Moscow. However, such an option is particularly complex to carry out in that, in the case of a regional conflict, the means of the new triad could be used against Chinese forces for counter attack operations. Due to competition between the two countries in the region and particularly around Taiwan, the ability of Chinese political authorities to reach an agreement with the United States that would increase transparency of the Chinese arsenal should also be minimal. Eventually, it would appear possible to extend the dialog that has been set up between the two countries on military and strategic questions so as to include the question of nuclear postures. Such an approach would at least prevent a sudden change in China from increasing risks related to the use of conventional American strategic forces. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">China and the United States are not in a strategic weapons arms race. Nonetheless, their modernization and sizing decisions increasingly are framed with the other in mind. Nuclear weapons are at the core of this interlocking pattern of development. In particular, China is the only permanent member of the UN Security Council expanding its arsenal; it is also enhancing its arsenal. The basic facts of Chinese strategic modernization are well known, if the details remain frustratingly opaque. China is deploying road-mobile, solid-fueled missiles, giving it a heighted degree of security in its second-strike capability. It is beginning to deploy ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). It is researching a wide range of warhead and delivery systems technologies that will lead to increased accuracy and, more pointedly, increased penetration against ballistic missile defenses. The size of China's deliverable arsenal against the United States will undoubtedly increase beyond the few dozen that it possessed recently.[1] The pace of growth thus far has been moderate, although China has only recently developed reliable, survivable delivery systems. The final endpoint remains mired in opacity and uncertainty, although several score of deliverable warheads seems likely for the near term. These developments on the strategic side are coupled with elements of conventional modernization that impinge on the strategic balance.[2] The relevant issue, however, is not simply an evaluation of the Chinese modernization program, but rather an evaluation of the interaction of that modernization with U.S. capabilities and interests. U.S. capabilities are also changing. Under the provisions of START and SORT, the United States has continued to engage in quantitative reductions of its operational nuclear arsenal. At the same, there is ongoing updating of warhead guidance and fusing systems. Ballistic missile defense systems of a variety of footprints are being deployed. The U.S. SSBN force now leans more toward the Pacific than the Atlantic, reversing the Cold War deployment. Guam's capacity to support heavy bombers and attack submarines has been enhanced. Furthermore, advances in U.S. conventional weaponry have been so substantial that they too promise strategic effects: prompt global strike holds out the promise of a U.S. weapon on target anywhere in the world in less than an hour and B-2s with highly accurate weapons can sustain strategic effects over a campaign. What are the concerns posed by these two programs of dynamic strategic arsenals? Most centrally, the development of the strategic forces detailed above has increasingly assumed an interlocked form. The U.S. revolution in precision guided munitions was followed by an emphasis on mobility in the Chinese missile force. U.S. missile defense systems have clearly spurred an emphasis on countermeasures in China's ICBM force and quantitative buildups in its regional missile arsenals.[3] Beijing's new submarine-based forces further enhance the security of China's second-strike capability in the face of a potential U.S. strike but are likely to lead to increased attention to anti-submarine warfare in the United States. China's recent anti-satellite test provoked a U.S. demonstration of similar capabilities. Such reciprocal responses have the potential to move toward a tightly coupled arms race and certainly have already worsened threat perceptions on each side. The potential for conflict is not simply that of inadvertent escalation; there are conflicts of interests between the two. Heightening threat perceptions in that context greatly complicates diplomacy. Further, the dangers of inadvertent escalation have been exacerbated by some of these moves. Chinese SSBN deployment will stress an untested command-and-control system. Similar dangers in the Cold War were mitigated, although not entirely overcome, over a period of decades of development of personnel and technical solutions. China appears to have few such controls in place today. U.S. deployment of highly accurate nuclear warheads is consistent with a first-strike doctrine and seems sized for threats larger than &quot;rogue&quot; nations. These too would undermine stability in an intense crisis. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">What would happen if China launched its 20 Dongfeng-5 intercontinental ballistic missiles, each with a 5-megaton warhead, at 20 major U.S. cities? Prevailing opinion in Washington D.C. until not so long ago was that the raids would cause over 40 million casualties, annihilating much of the United States. In order to avoid such a doomsday scenario, consensus was that the United States would have to eliminate this potential threat at its source with preemptive strikes on China. But cool heads at institutions such as the Federation of American Scientists and the National Resource Defense Council examined the facts and produced their own analyses in 2006, which differed from the hard-line views of their contemporaries. The FAS and NRDC developed several scenarios involving nuclear strikes over ICBM sites deep in the Luoning Mountains in China’s western province of Henan, and analyzed their implications. One of the scenarios involved direct strikes on 60 locations – including 20 main missile silos and decoy silos – hitting each with one W76-class, 100-kiloton multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle carried on a submarine-launched ballistic missile. In order to destroy the hardened silos, the strikes would aim for maximum impact by causing ground bursts near the silos' entrances. Using air bursts similar to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would not be as effective, as the blasts and the heat would dissipate extensively. In this scenario, the 6 megatons of ground burst caused by the 60 attacks would create enormous mushroom clouds over 12 kilometers high, composed of radioactive dirt and debris. Within 24 hours following the explosions, deadly fallout would spread from the mushroom clouds, driven by westerly winds toward Nanjing and Shanghai. They would contaminate the cities' residents, water, foodstuff and crops, causing irreversible damage. The impact of a 6-megaton nuclear explosion would be 360 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, killing not less than 4 million people. Such massive casualties among non-combatants would far exceed the military purpose of destroying the enemy's military power. This would cause political harm and damage the United States’ ability to achieve its war aims, as it would lose international support. On the other hand, China could retaliate against U.S. troops in East Asia, employing intermediate-range ballistic missiles including its DF-3, DF-4 and DF-21 missiles, based in Liaoning and Shandong provinces, which would still be intact. If the United States wanted to destroy China's entire nuclear retaliatory capability, U.S. forces would have to employ almost all their nuclear weapons, causing catastrophic environmental hazards that could lead to the annihilation of mankind. Accordingly, the FAS and NRDC conclusively advised U.S. leaders to get out of the vicious cycle of nuclear competition, which costs staggering sums, and to promote nuclear disarmament talks with China. Such advice is worth heeding by nuclear hard-liners. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Telegraph 2/22 [The Daily Telegraph (London), US threats to China over 'star wars' arms race; INVESTIGATION The WikiLeaks files Standoff behind the scenes Tim Ross; Holly Watt; Christopher Hope NEWS; FRONT PAGE; Pg. 1,3 Lexis] /hn </span><br />
<span class="Underline">THE United States threatened to take military action against China during a secret &quot;star wars&quot; arms race, according to leaked documents obtained by The Daily Telegraph. The two nuclear superpowers both shot down their own satellites using sophisticated missiles in separate shows of strength, the files suggest. The American government was so incensed by Chinese actions in space that it privately warned Beijing it would face military action if it did not desist. The Chinese carried out further tests as recently as last year, however, leading to protests from Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, secret documents show. Beijing justified its actions by accusing the Americans of developing an &quot;offensive&quot; laser weapon system that would have the capability of destroying missiles before they left enemy territory. The disclosures are contained in the latest documents obtained by the WikiLeaks website, which have been released to The Daily Telegraph. They detail the private fears of both superpowers as they sought mastery of the new military frontier. The &quot;star wars&quot; arms race began in January 2007 when China shocked the White House by shooting down one of its weather satellites 530 miles above Earth. The strike, which resulted in thousands of pieces of debris orbiting the Earth, raised fears that the Chinese had the power to cause chaos by destroying US military and civilian satellites. In February 2008, America launched its own &quot;test&quot; strike to destroy a malfunctioning American satellite, which demonstrated to the Chinese that it also had the capability to strike in space. America stated at the time that the strike was not a military test but a necessary mission to remove a faulty spy satellite. The leaked documents appear to show its true intentions. One month before the strike, the US criticised Beijing for launching its own &quot;anti-satellite test&quot;, noting: &quot;The United States has not conducted an anti-satellite test since 1985.&quot; In a formal diplomatic protest, officials working for Condoleezza Rice, the then secretary of state, told Beijing: &quot;A Chinese attack on a satellite using a weapon launched by a ballistic missile threatens to destroy space systems that the United States and other nations use for commerce and national security. Destroying satellites endangers people.&quot; The warning continued: &quot;Any purposeful interference with US space systems will be interpreted by the United States as an infringement of its rights and considered an escalation in a crisis or conflict.&quot; The United States reserves the right, consistent with the UN Charter and international law, to defend and protect its space systems with a wide range of options, from diplomatic to military.&quot; The Chinese strike in 2007 was highly controversial, prompting criticism from other nations and fears that it could prompt a revival of President Reagan's &quot;Star Wars&quot; programme, that was abandoned in the 1980s. In February 2008, America shot down one of its own satellites, ostensibly to stop it returning to earth with a toxic fuel tank which would pose a health hazard. The Chinese did not believe the explanation. In secret dispatches, US officials indicated that the strike was, in fact, military in nature. Immediately after the US Navy missile destroyed the satellite, the American Embassy in China received &quot;direct confirmation of the results of the anti-satellite test&quot; from the US military command in the Pacific, according to a secret memo. The American strike marked the high point of tensions between Washington and Beijing over the issue of ballistic missile defence. The cables show that China was deeply concerned about America's plans to place missile defence radars in Japan. Another document discloses that the US was allegedly developing an &quot;airborne laser system&quot; to counter the threat from &quot;Chinese military build up&quot;. The Chinese government was said to be &quot;angry&quot; about the US satellite exercise in February 2008. For months after the US strike, the two countries engaged in tense talks over the issue. At a summit on defence in June 2008, the American delegation told the Chinese that Washington did not regard China as &quot;an enemy&quot;. China replied that it saw the two powers &quot;as neither allies nor adversaries&quot;. The Chinese assistant foreign minister complained that the US missile defence programme was not simply &quot;defensive&quot; but also &quot;offensive&quot; because &quot;it includes lasers that attack a missile in launch phase over the sovereign territory of the launching country&quot;. The most recent cable in the collection was sent from the office of Mrs Clinton in January 2010. It claimed that US intelligence detected that China had launched a fresh anti-satellite missile test. Crucially, Washington wanted to keep secret its knowledge that the missile test was linked to China's previous space strikes. The cable, marked &quot;secret&quot; said the Chinese army had sent an SC-19 missile that successfully destroyed a CSS-X-11 missile about 150 miles above the Earth. &quot;This test is assessed to have furthered both Chinese ASAT [anti-satellite] and ballistic missile defense technologies,&quot; stated the memo to the US embassy in Beijing . Mrs Clinton's cable stressed that &quot;the Obama administration&quot; retained the Bush-era concerns over Chinese space weapon plans. Last night a Pentagon spokesman said: &quot;Our overriding objective is to promote the peaceful use of space. &quot;The United States did not engage our own satellite to test or demonstrate an anti-satellite capability. The purpose was to prevent the satellite's hydrazine fuel from causing potential harm to life on the ground.&quot; Today The Daily Telegraph publishes another 39 leaked cables on its website, bringing the total to 550 in three days. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Any clear-cut distinction between offensive and defense in the TMD context is hopelessly muddied when one realizes that plans for the NTW system include a substantial space component. An elaborate network of space satellites (as well as spaceborne forces to protect them) would be essential features of any robust NTW system, providing early warning data of enemy missile launches, as well as tracking information designed to guide SM-3 interceptors to their targets in mid-flight. It is instructive to note that politically powerful missile defense proponents such as U.S. Senator Bob “Spaceman” Smith (R-NH) envision NTW integrated into an overall space force that would pursue both defensive and offensive military missions.49 We need to incorporate forward-deployed capabilities like the Navy Theater Wide program and the Air Force Airborne Laser as space-based missile defense programs to ensure [that] we can stop missiles in their boost phase, dropping the debris fallout over our adversary’s homes, not ours…[S]pace offers us…the prospect of inflicting violence—all with great precision and nearly instantaneously, and often more cheaply. With credible offensive and defensive space control, we will deter our adversaries, reassure our allies, and guard our nation’s growing reliance on global commerce.50 This full-throated call for a robust blend of offensive and defensive space weaponry reflects a strategic principle elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, “anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand.”51 The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent “dual capability” of spaceborne weapon components. To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting “death stars,” capable of sending munitions hurtling through the earth’s atmosphere at dizzying velocities.52 As Marc Vidricaire, a member of the Canadian Delegation to the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, explains: “If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land.”53 Furthermore, spaceborne BMD components can be used for offensive attacks in outer space itself, where orbiting space assets belonging to adversaries could be targeted for destruction. According to defense analyst James E. Oberg, “…the benign, defensive nature of a ballistic missile killer is not the only facet of such a system—it also has inherent offensive capability against satellites.”54 This dual capability of BMD systems provides one rationale for why space weapons advocates such as Senator Smith propose to make offensive attack weapons part of missile defense. In a world where deployment of purely offensive space weaponry might be difficult to justify as a stand-alone military initiative, Oberg speculates, “the means by which the placement of space-based weapons will likely occur is under a second U.S. space policy directive—that of ballistic missile defense.”55 Although these “death star” scenarios might seem like they come straight out of Hollywood special effects studios, it is worth noting that the U.S. Space Command is on record endorsing military strategy that favors weaponization of space as a force multiplier for offensive attack missions. An official planning document entitled “Vision for 2020” foresees “space-based strike weapons” as part of “global engagement capabilities” designed to enable “application of precision force from, through, and to space.”56 Aggressive pursuit of these “strike weapons” is imperative, according to Space Command officials, because “space superiority is emerging as an essential element of battlefield success and future warfare.”57 Arguing that “it is inevitable that mankind will weaponize space,” Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas D. Bell claims in a 1999 paper that, “The U.S. ability to conduct combat operations in this environment will provide the technical asymmetry that the U.S. will need to win the next war, just as it used strategic bombers and the atomic bomb to win World War II and stealth technology and precision guided munitions to win the Gulf War.”58 These plans recently received concrete expression in comments from Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, Air Force Space Command Commander. While addressing a group at the Joint Tactical Ground Station in South Korea, Eberhart declared that “[s]pace is the ultimate high ground…Not only do we have to use it, we have to be able to defend it and deny our enemy the use of space if we are at war…we have to ensure space superiority for our commanders and men and women who rely on it during the fight.”59 Although missile defense advocates frequently trumpet the “purely defensive” nature of BMD, such systems exist in a strategic framework that ineluctably includes offensive space weaponry. “The PR spin is that the U.S. military push into space is about missile defense or defense of U.S. space satellites. But the volumes of material coming out of the military are concerned mainly with offense— with using space to establish military domination over the world below,” notes professor Karl Grossman.60 Such a suggestion carries particular significance for Japan, since as Frank Umbach, Senior Research Fellow at the German Society of Foreign Affairs, explains, “a possible Japanese TMD deployment may require an integration of the anti-missile defense command and control (C-2) systems of Japan and the U.S., which could have far-reaching implications for both sides.”61 Eventual deployment of a joint Japan-U.S. TMD system could saddle Japanese officials with the sober responsibility of making command decisions regarding use of spaceborne weapons for offensive military missions. It is tempting to take comfort in the idea that JDA leaders would not permit a joint missile defense system such as NTW to evolve into a platform for offensive space power, especially since such a development would flout Japanese legal and constitutional prohibitions against such military adventures. However, in a joint command situation, it is not clear that such constraints would hold up, especially in light of intimidating comments by space power enthusiasts such as Senator Smith, who vows to use his position on Capitol Hill to ram space weaponry down the throats of opponents, regardless of how vocal they are: “If the Air Force cannot or will not embrace spacepower, we in Congress will have to drag them there, kicking and screaming if necessary.”62 Another possibility is that Japanese objections against incorporation of offensive space power into a joint missile defense program could be rendered moot by strategic deception. Part II of this essay explored cases where U.S. missile defense advocates deployed subterfuge to camouflage the actual purpose of BMD programs, in order to insulate the program from political criticism. A similar approach would seem politically attractive for public affairs officers dealing with the sensitive issue of a Japanese TMD’s offensive military capabilities. Since such capabilities would clearly prove to be public relations liabilities for missile defense advocates attempting to justify TMD to Asian publics, there could be great institutional inertia to pursue a Pentagon-style public relations strategy of hiding such capabilities behind layers of secrecy, classification, and obfuscation, then dominating public debate with talk of “purely defensive” BMD systems. However, back door deployment of offensive space weapons would pose grave security risks, given the potentially disastrous consequences of an unconstrained arms race in space. Lt. Col. Bell provides a glimpse of some of the varieties of space weapons that might be produced in such a scenario: “A mix of space weapons will offer the capability to destroy various types of surface and sub-surface targets with three types of weapons: continuous lasers that use heat to melt structures and destroy them; pulsed lasers that vaporize material and penetrate the structure; and kinetic energy weapons that provide the capability to attack targets hundreds of feet under the surface of the earth.”63 According to Senator Charles S. Robb (D-VA), space weaponization could transform Reagan’s hopeful Star Wars vision into an ominous “death star” future. During the Reagan years, advocates of the Strategic Defense Initiative ran an effective television spot featuring children being saved from nuclear attack by a shield represented by a rainbow. If we weaponize space, we will face a very different image—the image of hundreds of weapons-laden satellites orbiting directly over our homes and our families 24 hours a day, ready to fire within seconds. If fired, they would destroy thousands of ground, air, and space targets within minutes, before there is even a chance of knowing what has happened, or why. This would be a dark future, a future we should avoid at all costs.64 A buildup of space weapons with capability to execute offensive missions might begin with noble intentions of “peace through strength” deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that “…the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use.”65 Military commanders desiring to harness the precision strike capability afforded by spacebased “smart” weapons might order deliberate attacks on enemy ground targets in a crisis. The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense “use or lose” pressure into strategic calculations, with the specter of split-second laser attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting death stars with automated “hair trigger” devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed “complexly interactive, tightly coupled” industrial systems, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other’s flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. He further explains, “[t]he odd term ‘normal accident’ is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable.”66 Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to “normal accidents.” It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to Bowman, “even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage—even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!”67 In the same laser technology touted by President Reagan as the quintessential tool of peace, David Langford sees one of the most wicked offensive weapons ever conceived: “One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people.”68 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to a space weapon attack would escalate by retaliating with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen. </span><br />

 <span class="Underline">Debate over nuclearization is increasing- the issue is becoming increasingly partisan in the diet </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Toki 3/1 [Japan's Defense Guidelines: New Conventional Strategy, Same Old Nuclear Dilemma Author: Masako Toki, Project Manager and Research Associate [1] Monterey Institute for International Studies James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies March 1, 2011] </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In contrast to the other major strategic changes spelled out in the December 2010 NDPG, the document reiterates the same provisions articulated in earlier NDPGs regarding nuclear weapons. The new NDPG stipulates that &quot;... as long as nuclear weapons exist, the extended deterrence provided by the United States, with nuclear deterrent as a vital element, will be indispensable. In order to maintain and improve the credibility of the extended deterrence, Japan will closely cooperate with the United States, and will also appropriately implement its own efforts, including ballistic missile defense and civil protection.&quot;[21] There is therefore a continued tension between Japan's support for global nuclear disarmament and its ongoing reliance on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence. During decades of LDP governance, Japan relied on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence and supported the U.S. decision to abstain from a no-first use policy. During the 2009 election campaign, then-Prime Minister Aso stated that Japan should support the U.S. policy of retaining the right to use its nuclear weapons first, given the uncertainty in the regional security environment. [22] In contrast, the DPJ's center-left orientation and history of supporting nuclear disarmament suggested that it might take a significantly different approach to nuclear disarmament and extended deterrence. While some nuances of the government's nuclear policy appear to be shifting, no significant policy changes in the areas of nuclear disarmament or extended deterrence are reflected in the DPJ's National Defense Program Guidelines. While both the 2010 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review and the 2010 NPT Review Conference Final Document acknowledged the need to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in states' security policies, Japan's new NDPG does not specifically endorse that idea. It lacks strategic depth regarding the current and future role of extended nuclear deterrence in Japanese policy, and fails to clarify how Japan can balance its interest in disarmament with its need for security in a challenging regional environment. The only significant difference from past NDPGs on the issue of extended deterrence, which may be indicative of a small shift in policy, is the suggestion in the 2010 document that extended nuclear deterrence is part of general extended deterrence. This is clearer when one compares the new NDPG with the 2004 version that states, &quot;To protect its territory and people against the threat of nuclear weapons, Japan will continue to rely on the U.S. nuclear deterrent.&quot;[23] While the 2010 document talks about the U.S. nuclear deterrent as a &quot;vital element&quot; of U.S. extended deterrence, it is not singled out as the only element of deterrence. This subtle change appears to reflect the 2010 U.S. NPR's emphasis on reducing the role of nuclear weapons, while continuing to strengthen conventional deterrence.[24] However, the NDPG does not explicitly state that the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. deterrence should be reduced, or discuss the issue in the context of nuclear disarmament progress. Japan's reliance on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence is a pillar of the country's national security policy, and one that is often faulted by domestic and international critics as undermining the goal of a nuclear free world. This type of domestic politics criticism is particularly vocal in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On the 6 August 2010 anniversary of the Hiroshima atomic bombing, Hiroshima Mayor Tadatoshi Akiba called for the Japanese government to legislate into law the Three Non-Nuclear Principles and to abandon the U.S. &quot;nuclear umbrella.&quot;[25] Later that day, Prime Minister Naoto Kan countered this statement by asserting that, &quot;nuclear deterrence continues to be necessary for our nation at a time when there are unclear and uncertain factors.&quot;[26] Three days later, at the 9 August commemoration of the Nagasaki atomic bombing, Nagasaki Mayor Tomihisa Taue also supported the idea of enacting the Three Non-Nuclear Principles into law, urging the Japanese government to pursue security without relying upon a &quot;nuclear umbrella.&quot;[27] Both mayors advocated the establishment of a nuclear weapons convention to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.[28] Mayor Taue also urged Japan to promote disarmament and nonproliferation education strongly, supporting the joint statement that had been submitted by Japan with more than 40 other countries at the NPT Review Conference.[29] While little has officially changed about the Japanese government's nuclear policy since the DPJ assumed power, the anniversary celebrations highlighted how internally conflicted the new governing party appears to be concerning its nuclear policies. After being criticized for asserting a continued need for extended nuclear deterrence on the Hiroshima Memorial Day, Prime Minister Kan reversed course and expressed his support for making the Three Non-Nuclear Principles a legally binding law, which confused many of his colleagues.[30] Moreover, some members of the DPJ government have taken other occasions to attempt to prove the party is more serious about nuclear disarmament than its predecessor—these small-scale changes simply have not impacted bigger picture policies such as the NDPG. The first Foreign Minister under the DPJ government, Katsuya Okada, a well-known advocate of nuclear disarmament and no-first use of nuclear weapons, demonstrated his difference from the preceding LDP governments on the 1969 secret agreement between the United States and Japan, which would permit the United States to bring nuclear weapons into Okinawa in the case of an emergency. Under successive LDP administrations, the existence of the secret agreement had been consistently denied for decades, but Mr. Okada ordered a probe into the agreement.[31] Given that the secret agreement contradicted one of the Three Principles, non-introduction of nuclear weapons to Japan, the issue of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles was rekindled when the DPJ government brought the existence of the secret agreement to light. The Three Non-Nuclear Principles, particularly the third principle of non-introduction, have been debated often in the past. Hawkish politicians and scholars advocate reconsidering the non-introduction principle, though successive Prime Ministers have expressed their official support for the Three Principles. The Council on Security and Defense Capabilities in the New Era, formed to prepare the new NDPG, submitted its final report in August 2010.[32] Although the panel had pushed the idea to review and reconsider the third principle of non-introduction during the preparation period, in its final report it recommended that Japan maintain its Three Non-Nuclear Principles.[33] However, the report indicated that the issue of the non-introduction of nuclear weapons could be reconsidered in response to emerging threats in the region, stating that: &quot;there will be no need, for the time being, to revise the Three Non-Nuclear Principles... the most important point is 'not to allow any nuclear power to use nuclear weapons.' It is not necessarily wise to set out in advance a principle that seeks only to restrain the U.S.&quot;[34] Despite sporadic debates over the issue of non-introduction, it is highly unlikely that the Japanese government will explicitly state that the Three Principles need to be eased or modified in the foreseeable future. Perhaps what has been most noteworthy about nuclear policy under the new government is that while policy has not changed significantly, official debate has increased. Mainly because of Foreign Minister Okada's progressive views on nuclear disarmament and pressures from civil society for the LDP to make Japan's nuclear policies more pro-disarmament, the Japanese Diet conducted significant discussions on extended nuclear deterrence and no-first use of nuclear weapons. Particularly with an eye to shaping the new U.S. Nuclear Posture Review (released in April 2010), in February 2010 Japanese parliamentarians sent a joint letter to President Obama requesting that the United States declare an intention to limit the role of nuclear weapons to the &quot;sole-purpose&quot; of nuclear deterrence.[35] Additionally, in a letter to Secretary Clinton, Mr. Okada expressed his interest in holding bilateral discussions concerning the issues related to the debate over whether the United States should adopt a policy of no-first use of nuclear weapons.[36] </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Toki 8 “Under Fukuda, Japan Accelerates Ballistic Missile Defense Cooperation with the United States” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In December 2007, U.S.-Japan BMD cooperation reached a new milestone when the Japanese Maritime Self- Defense Force (MSDF) successfully conducted its first missile intercept test. The test also indicated that Japan’s new Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda may be as strong a supporter of BMD as his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, who resigned in September 2007. Abe had been vigorously advocating the revision or reinterpretation of Article 9 of Japan’s constitution in order to allow Japan to deploy a more extensive BMD system and to cooperate more fully in collective self-defense with the United States. Fukuda, while not as vocal on these issues, has continued to accelerate the deployment of BMD systems and push for closer security cooperation with Washington. (Most recently, he promoted the Diet’s January 11 passage of a bill to extend the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law to allow the Japanese MSDF to continue its refueling mission in the Indian Ocean, as part of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.) [1] While Fukuda is continuing Japan’s push toward a more robust BMD system, BMD faces on-going opposition in Japan, based both on its costs and its potential to roil relations with China. Transition from Abe to Fukuda Prime Minister Fukuda is generally perceived as more moderate than Abe, who was famous for his conservative nationalism and outspoken support of BMD. In his October 2007 policy statement to the 168th session of the Diet, for example, Fukuda did not directly mention missile defense or collective self-defense with the United States; in contrast, Abe continually highlighted these issues, particularly his desire to amend Article 9, which currently bars collective self-defense. [2] (Fukuda’s silence on missile defense issues in his statement derived, in part, from the need to stress more urgent agenda items facing his cabinet, particularly the extension of the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law.) As part of his efforts to foster closer cooperation with the United States, in April 2007, Abe formed a 13-member “Council on Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security” to make recommendations to the Cabinet by September 2007 on issues related to whether Japan should revise its interpretation of the constitution to allow collective self-defense. Such a change would be needed to permit Japan to participate in a joint missile defense system with the United States that was intended to protect the latter, as well as Japan. [3] However, after the devastating defeat of Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the Upper House Election in July 2007 and Abe’s sudden resignation in September, the Council’s members reportedly decided to delay making their recommendations. In early January Japanese media outlets reported that the Council planned to submit its recom-mendation by mid-January; however, as of January 24, a search of Japanese media failed to reveal whether the recommendations had been submitted to Prime Minister Fukuda. The Council had been expected to recommend that Japan interpret its constitution to allow collective self-defense, as Abe advocated. However, Fukuda’s policy is unlikely to reflect these recommendations, as he is reluctant to revise the interpretation of Article 9. Thus, in effect, the submission of a report will be largely ceremonial, formally completing the work of the Council. [4] Media sources have suggested that, given Fukuda’s cautious attitude toward the collective self-defense debate, he might seal any recommendations offered by the Council. [5] However, Fukuda may not be able to avoid more active engagement on the collective self-defense issue for long. Currently, the Japanese and U.S. governments are jointly developing an advanced version of the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block II A missile to improve its defensive capabilities against longer-range missiles, such as the Taepodong. [6] The new SM-3 is scheduled to be available by 2014. If Japan decides to deploy the advanced version of the SM-3, in addition to the current version, theoretically, Japan would also have the capability to intercept a missile heading for the United States. Thus, the decision to deploy the advanced SM-3 version would rekindle the debate over Article 9. [7] Opposition to BMD in Japan remains significant, based primarily on the considerable cost of the system. [8] According to the Ministry of Defense, the missile defense program is estimated to cost between 800 billion yen ($7.4 billion) and one trillion yen ($8.9 billion) through 2012. However, since Japan plans to continue to pursue still more advanced technologies, costs are likely to increase well beyond this amount. [9] According to the Ministry of Defense, fiscal year 2007, because it was the first year of actual deployment, is expected to mark the greatest annual expenditure for missile defense to date – 186.3 billion yen ($1.7 billion). [10] The total budget allocated for missile defense for fiscal year 2008 is 171.4 billion yen ($1.6 billion), only slightly lower than 2007. [11] Some Japanese defense industry officials assert that the domestic defense industry does not benefit from the government’s spending on BMD, because U.S.-developed and built SM-3s are used for flight tests. [12] In response to such criticism, Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba has insisted, “We can’t talk about how much money should be spent when human lives are at stake.” [13] </span><br />

<span class="Underline">It is not easy to predict Japan’s future path. The outlines of Japan’s security policy—the realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan, BMD, space development, and the demands of the business sector—were all established during the Bush-Koizumi era. The Obama and Hatoyama administrations might uphold this new status quo, or they might set off in very different directions. The Hatoyama government is, for now, buying time before making any major decisions on basic security policy. Under the previous government of Aso Taro, a report by an advisory panel to the prime minister on Japan’s future security was presented in June 2008. The key thrust of this panel was to change constitutional interpretation in order to allow the exercise of the right to collective self-defense. This report was essentially the supreme expression of the “defense reform” built by the Bush and Koizumi regimes. According to this plan, revision of the National Defense Program Guidelines and the Mid-Term Defense Program were also planned for the end of 2009. However, Prime Minister Hatoyama decided to postpone revision of defense policy by one year. He has also announced the establishment of a new panel of experts. Currently, the United States spends 42 percent of the $1.46 trillion dollars of annual global military expenditures, and East Asia is responsible for 13 percent. Furthermore, military expenditure in East Asia is increasing at a speed, which is pronounced even on an international scale. East Asia, home to an enormous U.S. military presence, is becoming the world’s largest weapons market. Japan has considerable latent potential to contribute to the freezing and reduction of regional, and global, military expenditures. Although Japan’s military expenditures remain quite high by global standards, Japan could set an important example for other countries by not increasing this amount and remaining within a standard of less than 1 percent of the GDP. The key issue is whether Japan will continue to develop high-tech military technology relating to BMD or not. The Japanese government and the Japanese public must answer a set of questions connected to these systems. Do they really function? What exactly is this system trying to protect, and from what? Is Japanese industry and technology just being mobilized in order to assume the place of U.S. defense? Is there a calm, efficient, and alternative method to removing the missile threat other than developing intercepting missiles? Toward Innovative Disarmament Cooperation Japanese and U.S. development of missile defense and related technology is clearly stimulating a backlash from China. This, in turn, helps China justify the modernization of its nuclear missile forces, leading to the promotion of a regional arms race and a worsening of the regional security environment. It is possible, through coordinated regional diplomacy and strengthened transparency and verification measures, to remove the nuclear and missile threats in a cooperative manner. Such an approach would increase confidence within the region, improve the security environment, ensure that regional resources are not being wastefully invested in military purposes, and bring us closer to building a sustainable peace in East Asia. To the extent that the realignment of U.S. forces reinforces U.S. regional and global power projection capabilities—rather than functioning as a cost-saving mechanism or as a means to enhance collective security—the backlash in Northeast Asia will be strengthened. If North Korea were to view the realignment of U.S. bases in Japan and South Korea as a threat, it will be less likely to follow through on denuclearization. If the relocation of U.S. bases leads to the construction of new bases within Japan or elsewhere, and increases expenses to that end, a key opportunity will have been lost. In order to serve the purpose of regional peace, the realignment of U.S. bases must be used to close redundant bases and promote their withdrawal. The new Hatoyama government is re-examining and trying to readjust the alliance with the United States in the name of “equal partnership” while also calling for the creation of an East Asia Community. Japan must not be misunderstood as reviving its early 20th-century ambitions for military hegemony in the region. The military spending issue can be a breakthrough for Japan, a way to show its commitment to peace while contributing to the construction of a new regional order. Japan should initiate negotiations with China and Korea toward a mutually coordinated freeze and reduction in military expenditure. Rather than abandoning its ties with the U.S. military industry, Japan should use the arms-export ban principle to negotiate and establish a regional framework to curb the arms trade and weapons proliferation. In 1967, Prime Minister Sato Eisaku introduced Japan’s Three Non-Nuclear Principles: not possessing, producing, or permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons. The Diet established these principles as national policy through a resolution in 1971. However, despite the “non-introduction” provision, considerable evidence indicates the existence of secret deals between the U.S. and Japanese government to allow the transit and port-calls of nuclear-weapons-equipped vessels, even since 1960. The Hatoyama government has established a commission to look into these secret deals. It is important to legalize these three principles to prevent a reintroduction of nuclear weapons into Japan. Legalizing the Non-Nuclear Principles will also create momentum for a nuclear weapon free zone in Northeast Asia that would, in turn, strengthen the nonproliferation regime in the region. Despite the advocacy of Keidanren, a concentrated investment in high-tech, military-civilian integrated technology would not lead to overall benefits for the Japanese economy. Such investments would have little economic effect for the vast majority of the Japanese labor force working in small or mid-size business. If Japan were to throw away its reputation as a “peaceful nation,” which it has maintained throughout the post-war era, the Japanese economy, so dependent on trade with Asia and the Middle East, would necessarily suffer. Instead of viewing the Self-Defense Forces as a way to boost employment, the Japanese government should establish an independent organization with straightforward humanitarian purposes such as disaster relief. Through exchange and humanitarian activities with and in neighboring countries, such an organization could reduce military expenditures and build regional confidence. The development of innovative cooperation for disarmament is now needed. At this critical juncture in history, only a cooperative-security approach can lead the way to the creation of a new order of peace. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">If the possibility existed of a mistaken preemption during and immediately after the Cold War, between the experienced nuclear forces and command systems of America and Russia, then it may be a matter of even more concern with regard to states with newer and more opaque forces and command systems. In addition, the Americans and Soviets (and then Russians) had a great deal of experience getting to know one another’s military operational proclivities and doctrinal idiosyncrasies, including those that might influence the decision for or against war. Another consideration, relative to nuclear stability in the present century, is that the Americans and their NATO allies shared with the Soviets and Russians a commonality of culture and historical experience. Future threats to American or Russian security from weapons of mass destruction may be presented by states or nonstate actors motivated by cultural and social predispositions not easily understood by those in theWest nor subject to favorable manipulation during a crisis. The spread of nuclear weapons in Asia presents a complicated mosaic of possibilities in this regard. States with nuclear forces of variable force structure, operational experience, and command-control systems will be thrown into a matrix of complex political, social, and cultural crosscurrents contributory to the possibility of war. In addition to the existing nuclear powers in Asia, others may seek nuclear weapons if they feel threatened by regional rivals or hostile alliances. Containment of nuclear proliferation in Asia is a desirable political objective for all of the obvious reasons. Nevertheless, the present century is unlikely to see the nuclear hesitancy or risk aversion that marked the ColdWar, in part, because the military and political discipline imposed by the Cold War superpowers no longer exists, but also because states in Asia have new aspirations for regional or global respect.12 The spread of ballistic missiles and other nuclear-capable delivery systems in Asia, or in the Middle East with reach into Asia, is especially dangerous because plausible adversaries live close together and are already engaged in ongoing disputes about territory or other issues.13 The Cold War Americans and Soviets required missiles and airborne delivery systems of intercontinental range to strike at one another’s vitals. But short-range ballistic missiles or fighter-bombers suffice for India and Pakistan to launch attacks at one another with potentially “strategic” effects. China shares borders with Russia, North Korea, India, and Pakistan; Russia, with China and NorthKorea; India, with Pakistan and China; Pakistan, with India and China; and so on. The short flight times of ballistic missiles between the cities or military forces of contiguous states means that very little time will be available for warning and attack assessment by the defender. Conventionally armed missiles could easily be mistaken for a tactical nuclear first use. Fighter-bombers appearing over the horizon could just as easily be carrying nuclear weapons as conventional ordnance. In addition to the challenges posed by shorter flight times and uncertain weapons loads, potential victims of nuclear attack in Asia may Nuclear Crisis Stability in Future Asia 121 also have first strike–vulnerable forces and command-control systems that increase decision pressures for rapid, and possibly mistaken, retaliation. This potpourri of possibilities challenges conventional wisdom about nuclear deterrence and proliferation on the part of policymakers and academic theorists. For policymakers in the United States and NATO, spreading nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in Asia could profoundly shift the geopolitics of mass destruction from a European center of gravity (in the twentieth century) to an Asian and/or Middle Eastern center of gravity (in the present century).14 This would profoundly shake up prognostications to the effect that wars of mass destruction are now passe, on account of the emergence of the “Revolution in Military Affairs” and its encouragement of information-based warfare.15 Together with this, there has emerged the argument that large-scale war between states or coalitions of states, as opposed to varieties of unconventional warfare and failed states, are exceptional and potentially obsolete.16 The spread ofWMDand ballistic missiles in Asia could overturn these expectations for the obsolescence or marginalization of major interstate warfare. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The fact that Japanese leaders have already shown a proclivity to extol TMD’s “purely defensive” qualities is evidence that any American export of missile defense to Japan will likely include not only technology, but also accompanying rhetorical strategies designed to politically safeguard such hardware in the crucible of public debate. As discussed earlier, missile defense advocates used Reagan’s suggestion that Star Wars could render nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete” to co-opt the rhetorical high ground occupied by the disarmament left. Tests were rigged and scientific processes manipulated to buoy the political fortunes of the Star Wars, Patriot, THAAD, and NMD programs. Further, the actual purposes of the Timberwind and NMD programs were covered up in attempts to hide politically unpopular aspects of such initiatives. Perhaps these episodes of strategic deception in U.S. missile defense advocacy would be easier to excuse if they were conducted by “rogue” scientists who broke the law for profit or fame. But CIA defense guidance documents, internal DOD directives, and presidential National Security Decision Directives reveal that during the Reagan Star Wars era, strategic deception was not only legally authorized, but also officially mandated, as part of the public relations campaign to promote missile defense.69 Although Japanese leaders greeted American Star Wars-era missile defense overtures with skepticism, the 1998 launch of a Taepodong missile by North Korea over Japan galvanized political support for TMD in Japan and led eventually to the inking of the August 1999 MOU between Japan and the U.S. Unfortunately, the same threatening environment that drives support for missile defense also provides rationales for public officials to ratchet up secrecy and dodge public accountability, with the explanation that full disclosure of the nature of TMD plans and their lack of scientific basis would give comfort to the enemy. However, this preemption of public debate introduces its own set of security concerns. Excessive secrecy locks in Cold War patterns of public discourse, where defense officials and industry representatives monopolize arguments, sealing their positions with the unassailable proof of classified evidence. Threat assessments drift toward worst-case scenarios generated from simulation and speculation, rather than more sober appraisals of foreign military capabilities and intentions. Military officials who see the idea of public debate as a superfluous luxury skirt critical arguments, removing issues of grave national importance from arenas of democratic deliberation. With these patterns of public argument structuring official missile defense discourse in the U.S. during the past two decades, American citizens have been coaxed to spend billions of dollars for doctored scientific experiments that cover up the technical flaws of ill-conceived BMD initiatives. The recent Japan-U.S. MOU on joint missile defense research clears the way for such strategies to be exported to Japanese public spheres. Export of these patterns of public argument to Japan could potentially produce tragic consequences. Profit-hungry aerospace companies, working with government scientists well-schooled in the art of technical deception, could swell political momentum for deployment of a TMD system that appears flawless, yet is riddled with systemic deficiencies that may only come to light in combat situations. This outcome my rockets in future conflicts, when in fact their level of vulnerability to missile strikes would be much greater than believed. could invite catastrophic miscalculations in Japanese foreign policy. False confidence in a seemingly impenetrable TMD shield could prompt Japan’s leaders to expect their nation to be protected from ene One shudders at the prospect that such a discrepancy between actual and perceived effectiveness of a Japanese TMD system would be brought to light by an actual ICBM launch on a Japanese city. Yet this is precisely the scenario that would seem possible if Japanese leaders embrace the American suggestion that missile defense can be a potent tool of diplomacy in scenarios of rogue state blackmail. In such situations, rather than yielding ground in a diplomatic stalemate, shielded nations would dare a rogue state (or state of concern) to follow through on their promise to launch an ICBM. Bluffing poker players who are forced to show their poor cards after a called bet often lose the hand. Presidents bluffing about the capability of their missile defense systems could lose entire cities. Some missile defense proponents maintain that even if a missile shield doesn’t work, cultivating the perception that it does can accomplish important diplomatic aims. On this logic, missile defenses work symbolically like medical placebos.70 For example, adherents of the “Reagan victory school” of history believe that the illusion of Star Wars’ effectiveness sped up collapse of the Soviet Union and helped deliver Cold War victory to the U.S.71 According to this reasoning, although Star Wars was a scientific bust, it nevertheless tricked Soviet leaders into spending millions of rubles in response, bankrupting the Soviet economy and forcing Soviet negotiators to make concessions in arms control negotiations.72 Today, a corollary of this strategy has appeared in the suggestion that a Japanese TMD could have similar effects on China. Some say that while TMD may be useless, it may be a useful tool of diplomatic negotiations. They reason that even though the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), also known as the Star Wars project, was impractical despite its enormous research cost, it was useful to push the Soviet Union into concession in U.S.-Soviet summit talks. By the same token, they say, TMD can also be used to obtain Chinese concessions.73 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">When assessing the Japan-U.S. TMD project, citizens interested in government accountability and nuclear safety would do well to put stock in the old aphorism: you can’t judge a book by its cover. If historical trends continue, there is good reason to expect that the official discourse on Japanese TMD will cover up technical failure and disguise politically unpopular missions planned for any joint Japan-U.S. system. There are several negative consequences that could result from such deception. One end result of a politically motivated decision to pursue Japanese TMD, based on doctored scientific data, could be deployment of a deeply flawed missile defense system that is technically bankrupt, yet has an illusory veneer of effectiveness. In addition to the fact that such a fraudulent scheme would sacrifice huge amounts of taxpayer funds at the altar of corporate profit, such a development would present profound security risks of its own. Consider that missile defense advocates point to the possibility of “rogue state blackmail” as an emerging threat justifying rapid pursuit of missile defense. This blackmail scenario envisages major powers embroiled in a diplomatic or military dispute where a socalled state of concern (e.g. North Korea, Iran or Iraq—armed with weapons of mass destruction [WMD]) attempts to exact concessions from wealthy states, by threatening their homelands with long-range rocket attack. 45 In such a tragic situation, it is suggested that missile defense would preserve “freedom of movement” to call the state of concern’s bluff. To do this, however, leaders of shielded nations would need to have supreme confidence in their missile defense systems. If such confidence was based on faulty or doctored feasibility data, the stage could be set for a miscalculation of tragic proportions. For example, misplaced faith in a leaky missile defense shield could mistakenly embolden a Japanese president to take diplomatic risks that would recklessly expose thousands (perhaps millions) of civilians to nuclear, chemical, or biological attack. 46 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Under the current Japanese government's interpretation of Article 9 of its Constitution, Japan's participation in collective self-defense is prohibited, as is using missile defense capabilities to defend a third country--even an ally such as the United States. Therefore, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a strong advocate of changing Article 9, formed the Council on Reconstruction of a Legal Basis for Security in April 2007 to provide recommendations on the right of collective self-defense. &quot;Whether it is appropriate for Japan to use its missile defense to intercept ballistic missiles targeting the United States&quot; was one of four scenarios he tasked the council to answer. The council was supposed to submit recommendations to the Cabinet by September 2007, but after the devastating defeat of Abe's ruling party in the upper house election in July 2007 and his abrupt resignation two months later, the council's members delayed making their recommendations. Abe's successor, Yasuo Fukuda, wasn't as enthusiastic about changing the constitutional interpretation. So even though the council submitted its recommendations stating that Japan should have the right to exercise collective self-defense last June, nothing has changed. Taro Aso, the country's third prime minister in two years, is more supportive of the right to collective self-defense, which might revitalize debate over the issue. Technologically, Japan currently doesn't have the capability to shoot down a missile heading toward the United States even if it legally could. But the two countries are currently developing SM-3 Block II A missiles that could potentially intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles. (See &quot;Japan Test Fires Its First Raytheon-Built Standard Missile-3.&quot;) As technological capabilities improve to intercept long-range ballistic missiles, the argument that Japan isn't allowed by its constitutional interpretation to shoot down a missile heading toward the United States might be perceived as unacceptable. Technical limitations. Although both the Japanese and U.S. governments have highlighted successful flight tests, all flight intercept tests have been conducted under highly structured conditions with information about the missile attack. In a real missile launch, it's highly unlikely that the launch location, timing of launch, and flight trajectories will be known, making it almost impossible to predict the percentage of success of an intercept in a real-world attack.

<span class="Underline">In this regard, Americans sorting through the missile defense issue have much to learn from Japanese nuclear abolition advocates, whose passionate opposition to nuclear weaponry is informed by the direct experience of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. According to Joseph Gerson, of the American Friends Service Committee, the “spirit and commitment” of the Japanese hibakusha (nuclear war survivors) are inspiring examples of the “will and steadfastness necessary to force governments to disarm and to return the nuclear genie back to its bottle.” 82 As the only nation to have ever been subjected to nuclear attack, Japan brings an important perspective to discussions of international security in a world bristling with weapons of mass destruction. Such perspective can help refocus missile defense debates in constructive ways on both sides of the Pacific. For example, as the recent report of the Tokyo Forum for Nuclear Non-Proliferation recommends, whatever the outcome of pending missile defense deployment decisions, nuclear disarmament should be the top priority in security policy: “Missile defenses should not be seen as an alternative to the norm of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.” 83 The report further suggests that it is especially important to maintain this emphasis on disarmament even in the event of affirmative BMD deployment decisions, through establishment of clear exit strategies that codify conditions under which missile defenses would be removed: “Nations would be wise to leave open the possibility that defensive deployments could be scaled back, or even eliminated, if the sources of concern were reduced or removed.” 84 In the other direction, Japanese citizens pondering the wisdom of spending billions of yen on American missile defense technology might reach more informed decisions by learning from the experience of American citizens, who have witnessed their government’s numerous (and largely futile) attempts to engineer an effective missile shield since 1944, when the U.S. Army initiated Project Thumper, the nation’s first BMD program. The history of U.S. missile defense is a trail littered with false promises, dashed expectations, and fraudulent science. Americans could do a service to their Japanese counterparts by sharing the details of this history, thereby putting missile defense advocates’ shopworn claim that effective defense is “just around the corner” in proper perspective. To the extent that reciprocal dialogue of this sort carves out deliberative spaces for citizens to participate more critically in public debates over missile defense, it has potential to challenge the hegemonic status of technocratic thinking as the basis of security policy. As security studies scholar Simon Dalby explains, the Cold War produced security discourses that “act to reduce the role of political discussion by recasting political issues in terms of technical problems.” Such discourses “depoliticize issues by involving technical expertise in the place of political decision-making.” 85 Today’s arguments for missile defense reflect this Cold War pattern of reasoning, with advocates prescribing the technical solution of defensive weapons as an elixir for the political problem of WMD proliferation. In this context, can dialogue and diplomacy really compete with the rhetorically delicious appeal of the missile defense tech-fix? The answer to this question hinges in large part on the efforts of scientists, scholars, and citizens to develop concrete security frameworks that provide credible alternatives to the technocratic model. One promising initiative in this regard is the “Diplomacy First!” proposal recently announced by the Union of German Scientists (VDW). This proposal is remarkable for the way it indicts American calls for NMD and TMD by developing detailed alternatives for dealing politically with the problem of WMD proliferation. Such alternatives are founded on a “policy of prevention” that seeks to control the spread of arms through means of “institutionalized dialogue.” 86 Kubbig’s Modernized, Mutually Minimizing Missile Threat Concept (“Quadruple M-TC”) represents one concrete expression of this strategy for achieving post-Cold War security through diplomacy, rather than technological dominance. Kubbig’s security blueprint may be of particular interest to Japanese officials and citizens, since it draws from recent successes in the North Korean case to illustrate the effectiveness of a “Diplomacy First!” approach. Contemporary missile defense discussions are freighted with weighty subtexts that often fail to surface in technically oriented debates conducted in official spheres of deliberation. One such subtext can be cast as a question of governance. 87 Should hard choices on nuclear weapons policy be left to the security “high priests,” 88 who generally make decisions based on secret data churned through recycled Cold War models? If not, is the vision of a post-Cold War democracy dividend on security policy a workable alternative worth pursuing? These questions signal that missile defense deployment decisions not only present important choices regarding military strategy; as moments of collective judgment, they can also be seen as virtual referenda on the relative merits of technocratic versus democratic forms of governanc </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Overseas Presence The need to deploy U.S. military forces abroad in peacetime is also an important factor in determining our overall force structure. We will maintain robust overseas presence in several forms, such as permanently stationed forces and prepositioned equipment, deployments and combined exercises, port calls and other force visits, as well as military-to military contacts. These activities provide several benefits. Specifically they: Gave form and substance to our bilateral and multilateral security commitments. Demonstrate our determination to defend U.S. and allied interests in critical regions, deterring hostile nations from acting contrary to those interests. Provide forward elements for rapid response in crises as well as the bases, ports and other infrastructure essential for deployment of U.S.-based forces by air, sea and land. o Enhance the effectiveness of coalition operations, including peace operations, by improving our ability to operate with other nations. Allow the United States to use its position of trust to prevent the development of power vacuums and dangerous arms races, thereby underwriting regional stability by precluding threats to regional security. Facilitate regional integration, since nations that may not be willing to work together in our absence may be willing to coalesce around us in a crisis. Promote an international security environment of trust, cooperation, peace and stability, which is fundamental to the vitality of developing democracies and free market economies for America's own economic well-being and security. Through training programs, combined exercises, military contacts, interoperability and shared defense with potential coalition partners, as well as security assistance programs that include <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">judicious foreign military sales</span>, we can strengthen the local self-defense capabilities of our friends and allies. Through active participation in regional security dialogues, we can reduce regional tensions, increase transparency in armaments and improve our bilateral and multilateral cooperation. By improving the defense capabilities of our friends and demonstrating our commitment to defend common interests, these activities enhance deterrence, encourage responsibility-sharing on the part of friends and allies, decrease the likelihood that U.S. forces will be necessary if conflict arises and raise the odds that U.S. forces will find a relatively favorable situation should a U.S. response be required.</span><br />

As indicated in the QDR, DoD clearly intends presence activities to promote at least three of these major goals. With regard to the assurance goal, the QDR specifies, for example, that the department believes the presence of US forces overseas to be one of the most profound symbols of the US commitment to its allies and friends, and says that DoD will honor its obligations and be a reliable security partner. [p. 11] With regard to deterrence of threats and coercion, the QDR argues for a multifaceted approach, one that places particular “emphasis upon peacetime forward presence in critical areas of the world, coupled with global intelligence, strike, and information assets in order to deter aggression with only modest reinforcement from outside the theater.” [p. 12] As for countering coercion (defeating any adversary), the QDR says that “US forces must maintain the capability to support treaty obligations and defeat the efforts of adversaries to impose their will on the United States, its allies, or friends.” [p. 13] The document also cites a number of related objectives that DoD intends to promote and achieve through presence activities that it labels security cooperation, saying [they] “will serve as an important means for linking DoD’s strategic direction with those of its allies and friends…. A particular aim of DoD’s security cooperation efforts will be to ensure access, interoperability, and intelligence cooperation, while expanding the range of preconflict options to available counter coercive threats, deter aggression, or favorably prosecute war on US terms.” [p. 20]<br />

<span class="underline0"> The postmodern passwords of &quot;polyvocality,&quot; &quot;Otherness,&quot; and &quot;difference,&quot; unsupported by substantial analysis of the concrete contexts of subjects, creates a solipsistic quagmire</span>. The political sympathies of the new cultural critics, with their ostensible concern for the lack of power experienced by marginalized people, aligns them with the political left. Yet, <span class="underline0">despite their adversarial posture and talk of opposition, their discourses on intertextuality and inter-referentiality isolate them from and ignore the conditions that have produced leftist politics--conflict, racism, poverty, and injustice</span>. In short, as Clarke (1991) asserts, postmodern emphasis on new subjects conceals the old subjects, those who have limited access to good jobs, food, housing, health care, and transportation, as well as to the media that depict them. Merod (1987) decries <span class="underline0">this</span> situation as one which <span class="underline0">leaves no vision, will, or commitment to activism</span>. He notes that academic lip service to the oppositional is underscored by the absence of focused collective or politically active intellectual communities. Provoked by the academic manifestations of this problem Di Leonardo (1990) echoes Merod and laments: <span class="underline0">Has there ever been a historical era characterized by as little radical analysis or activism and as much radical-chic writing as ours? Maundering on about Otherness: phallocentrism or Eurocentric tropes has become a lazy academic substitute for actual engagement with the detailed histories and contemporary realities</span> of Western racial minorities, white women, or any Third World population. (p. 530) Clarke's assessment of the <span class="underline0">postmodern elevation of language to the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of critical discussion is an even stronger indictment against the trend</span>. Clarke examines Lyotard's (1984) The Postmodern Condition in which Lyotard maintains that virtually all social relations are linguistic, and, therefore, it is through the coercion that threatens speech that we enter the &quot;realm of terror&quot; and society falls apart. To this assertion, Clarke replies: <span class="underline0">I can think of few more striking indicators of the political and intellectual impoverishment of a view of society that can only recognize the discursive. If the worst terror we can envisage is the threat not to be allowed to speak, we are appallingly ignorant of terror in its elaborate contemporary forms. It may be the intellectual's conception of terror</span> (what else do we do but speak?), <span class="underline0">but its projection onto the rest of the world would be calamitous</span>....(pp. 2-27) <span class="underline0">The</span> realm of the <span class="underline0">discursive is derived from the requisites for human life, which are in the physical world, rather than in a world of ideas or symbols</span>.(4) Nutrition, shelter, and protection are basic human needs that require collective activity for their fulfillment. <span class="underline0">Postmodern emphasis on the discursive without an accompanying analysis of how the discursive emerges from material circumstances hides the complex task of envisioning and working towards concrete social goals</span> (Merod, 1987). Although the material conditions that create the situation of marginality escape the purview of the postmodernist, the situation and its consequences are not overlooked by scholars from marginalized groups. Robinson (1990) for example, argues that &quot;<span class="underline0"><strong>the justice that working people deserve is economic, not just textual</strong></span>&quot; (p. 571). Lopez (1992) states that &quot;<span class="underline0">the starting point for organizing the program content of education or political action must be the present existential, concrete situation</span>&quot; (p. 299). West (1988) asserts that borrowing French post-structuralist discourses about &quot;Otherness&quot; blinds us to realities of American difference going on in front of us (p. 170). Unlike postmodern &quot;textual radicals&quot; who Rabinow (1986) acknowledges are &quot;fuzzy about power and the realities of socioeconomic constraints&quot; (p. 255), most writers from marginalized groups are clear about how discourse interweaves with the concrete circumstances that create lived experience. <span class="underline0"><strong>People whose lives form the material for postmodern counter-hegemonic discourse do not share the optimism over the new recognition of their discursive subjectivities,</strong> because such an acknowledgment does not address sufficiently their collective historical and current struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic injustice. They do not appreciate being told they are living in a world in which there are no more real subjects. Ideas have consequences. <strong>Emphasizing the discursive self when a person is hungry and homeless represents both a cultural and humane failure.</strong></span><br />

<strong>Public debate over BMD is opens up space space for excluded and co-opted voices – key to challenge technocratic security domination and securitization and reshape policy</strong><br />

Evangelista’s analysis of the influence exerted by transnational peace movement activists in the U.S. and Russia during the late 1980s provides one concrete illustration of how energetic dissent can loosen the grip of the Cold War language game. Using what Olson and Goodnight call “discursive oppositional arguments,” American and Soviet anti-nuclear movements linked up to create, in Rita Felski’s terminology, a “counter-public sphere” that rejected the self-reinforcing logic of what Herbert York calls an “internal arms race.”78 Bernd W. Kubbig, of the Peace Research Institute at Frankfurt, Germany, notes that scientists and scholars critical of the arms race “functioned as icebreakers during the Cold War,” working as an “epistemic community” with “an authoritative claim to policy-relevant knowledge.”79 According to Evangelista, the successful efforts of transnational movement allies to shift the terms of public debate through “strategic use of norms, ideas, and information,” created conditions where the superpowers were coaxed to step back from the abyss of nuclear annihilation.80 A similar opportunity presents itself today, with the Japan-U.S. TMD research project still in an embryonic stage. Recent official discourse on this project largely reflects Cold War themes and norms of argumentation. In Japan, Funabashi notes that so far, “government responses to questions on TMD” have been “provided at only a cursory level,” and that the TMD issue “is something that has been discussed only within an extremely small circle of security professionals— the so-called security high priests.”81 However, peace movement advocates in Japan and the U.S. could use the TMD issue to galvanize transnational counter-public spheres, opening up spaces for perennially excluded and co-opted voices to gain traction in public debates on security policy. In such spaces, citizens from both nations could draw upon each other’s experience to shape the tenor and substance of public discourse. In this regard, Americans sorting through the missile defense issue have much to learn from Japanese nuclear abolition advocates, whose passionate opposition to nuclear weaponry is informed by the direct experience of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. According to Joseph Gerson, of the American Friends Service Committee, the “spirit and commitment” of the Japanese hibakusha (nuclear war survivors) are inspiring examples of the “will and steadfastness necessary to force governments to disarm and to return the nuclear genie back to its bottle.”82 As the only nation to have ever been subjected to nuclear attack, Japan brings an important perspective to discussions of international security in a world bristling with weapons of mass destruction. Such perspective can help refocus missile defense debates in constructive ways on both sides of the Pacific. For example, as the recent report of the Tokyo Forum for Nuclear Non-Proliferation recommends, whatever the outcome of pending missile defense deployment decisions, nuclear disarmament should be the top priority in security policy: “Missile defenses should not be seen as an alternative to the norm of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.” 83 The report further suggests that it is especially important to maintain this emphasis on disarmament even in the event of affirmative BMD deployment decisions, through establishment of clear exit strategies that codify conditions under which missile defenses would be removed: “Nations would be wise to leave open the possibility that defensive deployments could be scaled back, or even eliminated, if the sources of concern were reduced or removed.”84 In the other direction, Japanese citizens pondering the wisdom of spending billions of yen on American missile defense technology might reach more informed decisions by learning from the experience of American citizens, who have witnessed their government’s numerous (and largely futile) attempts to engineer an effective missile shield since 1944, when the U.S. Army initiated Project Thumper, the nation’s first BMD program. The history of U.S. missile defense is a trail littered with false promises, dashed expectations, and fraudulent science. Americans could do a service to their Japanese counterparts by sharing the details of this history, thereby putting missile defense advocates’ shopworn claim that effective defense is “just around the corner” in proper perspective. To the extent that reciprocal dialogue of this sort carves out deliberative spaces for citizens to participate more critically in public debates hover missile defense, it has potential to challenge the hegemonic status of technocratic thinking as the basis of security policy. As security studies scholar Simon Dalby explains, the Cold War produced security discourses that “act to reduce the role of political discussion by recasting political issues in terms of technical problems.” Such discourses “depoliticize issues by involving technical expertise in the place of political decision-making.”85 Today’s arguments for missile defense reflect this Cold War pattern of reasoning, with advocates prescribing the technical solution of defensive weapons as an elixir for the political problem of WMD proliferation. In this context, can dialogue and diplomacy really compete with the rhetorically delicious appeal of the missile defense tech-fix? The answer to this question hinges in large part on the efforts of scientists, scholars, and citizens to develop concrete security frameworks that provide credible alternatives to the technocratic model. One promising initiative in this regard is the “Diplomacy First!” proposal recently announced by the Union of German Scientists (VDW). This proposal is remarkable for the way it indicts American calls for NMD and TMD by developing detailed alternatives for dealing politically with the problem of WMD proliferation. Such alternatives are founded on a “policy of prevention” that seeks to control the spread of arms through means of “institutionalized dialogue.”86 Kubbig’s Modernized, Mutually Minimizing Missile Threat Concept (“Quadruple M-TC”) represents one concrete expression of this strategy for achieving post-Cold War security through diplomacy, rather than technological dominance. Kubbig’s security blueprint may be of particular interest to Japanese officials and citizens, since it draws from recent successes in the North Korean case to illustrate the effectiveness of a “Diplomacy First!” approach. Contemporary missile defense discussions are freighted with weighty subtexts that often fail to surface in technically oriented debates conducted in official spheres of deliberation. One such subtext can be cast as a question of governance.87 Should hard choices on nuclear weapons policy be left to the security “high priests,”88 who generally make decisions based on secret data churned through recycled Cold War models? If not, is the vision of a post-Cold War democracy dividend on security policy a workable alternative worth pursuing? These questions signal that missile defense deployment decisions not only present important choices regarding military strategy; as moments of collective judgment, they can also be seen as virtual referenda on the relative merits of technocratic versus democratic forms of governance.<br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Permutation do both- removing BMD is still key- it breaks down techno-securitization- Counterprolif attempts to protect us from “rogue states&quot; disregard to Russian and Chinese views on NMD expands our sphere of influence</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Ren <strong>Donglai</strong>, Professor at the Johns Hopkins University-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies, Fall <strong>2001</strong>, Asian Affairs: An American Review, Vol. 28, No. 3 </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Andrew Latham's article does not directly discuss the question of U.S. grand strategy; instead, he draws a wonderful picture of the &quot;American geopolitical imagination&quot; for us. It is that imagination that has helped to define American interests, shape perceptions of threat, and inform policy prescriptions in the areas of foreign relations and national defense. His arguments about American perceptions--both of itself and of the Third World--have made a deep impression on me. Particularly notable is his contention that strategic orientalism has shaped American policymakers' perception of the &quot;threat&quot; from so-called rogue states. bAs his paper suggests, America's self-representation as the &quot;the standard of civilization&quot; is full of arrogance and prejudice. In this way, Latham provides evidence that cultural criticism is a valuable approach for understanding contemporary international relations. In analyzing the contemporary American geopolitical imagination, Latham compares and contrasts the Cold War discourse and the post-Cold War discourse. I use Table 1 to summarize his main points. As we can see, the basic elements of the American geopolitical imagination have not changed so much between the Cold War and post-Cold War discourses. Americans still feel insecure and threatened from outside and still have a kind of Manifest Destiny in desiring to lead the world to a &quot;promised land.&quot; As Lathana puts it, &quot;With the end of the Cold War, the key elements of America's geopolitical imagination have been transformed in ways that mark a partial break with the Cold War discourse&quot; (emphasis added). If the contemporary American geopolitical imagination breaks only partially with the Cold War discourse, there is reason to believe that the basic strategic thinking of American policymakers, which was shaped in the Cold War, continues to inform American foreign and defense policy in the new century. Just as no one would deny that the United States had a grand strategy in the Cold War, whether we call it containment or anti-Communism, most foreign observers believe that Washington's actions today are also characterized by some kind of strategy. From the perspective of Chinese analysts, the concept of strategy is based on the common sense meaning of long-term, comprehensive planning. It is obviously beyond the scope of this commentary to provide a detailed defense of the idea that a U.S. grand strategy exists today. Instead, I will simply use Latham's arguments to show how a de facto geopolitical strategy can be derived from the American geopolitical imagination. Specifically, a geopolitical strategy can be identified by answering the following five questions: What are America's objectives? Who are its main rivals? What kinds of threats' does the United States have to address? What concept will guide American action? What means will the United States use for achieving its objectives? Just as Latham juxtaposed the Cold War and post-Cold War discourses, so too can we compare and contrast the Cold War and the post Cold War eras to organize our analysis of U.S. strategy. First, the objectives of U.S. strategy are virtually identical in the Cold War and the post-Cold War eras (see Table 2). If there is any difference, it is that Americans now want to maintain a unipolar world in which U.S. hegemony is unchallenged. Second, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the rogue states became the main rivals of the United States. Given the controversy surrounding this classification, however, American officials now use the term states of concern to replace the concept of rogue states. This change in terminology represents a significant shift in America's perception of its rivals. Unlike the undiplomatic and immoral notion of rogue states, the term states of concern is more flexible and therefore more useful. The new term implies both that the behavior of America's rivals can be modified and that classification of these states depends on particular situations and contexts. In this sense, states of concern could include not only the relatively small countries formerly identified as rogue states but also, in certain cases, larger powers. For example, when the Russians waged war in Chechnya, or if the Chinese were to decide to reunify with Taiwan by force. Russia and China would be considered states of concern in the minds of American policymakers. Third, during the Cold War the greatest threat to the United States came from the Soviet Union, which was seen as an aggressive, militaristic, expansionist, nuclear-armed empire implacably hostile to the United States. Invoking the discourse of the Cold War, American officials have framed policy over the last decade in terms of the need to contain inherently &quot;irrational&quot; Third World states armed with large conventional forces and weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). These states were seen as bent on sabotaging the world order. Fourth, as Latham argued at the July 2000 Emerging From Conflict conference, American policymakers have focused on four principal concepts in their counterproliferation strategy since the mid-1990s: denial, disarmament, deterrence, and defense. Fifth, as far as the means of U.S. policy are concerned, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin was quite explicit in outlining American counterproliferation policy in 1993. In addition to identifying a number of specific military and intelligence initiatives, Aspin noted that diplomacy, treaty restrictions, security assurances, export controls, nonmilitary sanctions, and economic cooperation would also remain important means of preventing, and coping with, the proliferation of WMDs. Relying not just on its own military capabilities, the United States has also sought to use international regimes (e.g., the Missile Technology Control Regime) to pursue its objectives. On the basis of this analysis, I conclude that U.S. foreign and defense policy is in fact characterized by a geopolitical strategy. With the end of the Cold War, the United States has upgraded (rather than merely maintained) its armaments and Cold War coalitions. By enlarging NATO, it has expanded its zone of defense in Europe. By strengthening its security ties with Japan in the Asia-Pacific, it has expanded its military coverage near the Taiwan Strait. In the Balkans and Central Asia, the United States has infiltrated Russia's traditional sphere of influence. Similarly, it has contained Iran and Iraq both by force and by backing the peace process in the Middle East. In its own backyard. American policymakers have tried to pacify the Caribbean through actions such as intervention in Haiti. As these examples suggest, the United States has clear and coherent diplomatic and military objectives in almost all strategic areas. Furthermore, in spite of strong opposition from Russia, China, and even Germany, the United States has decided to upset the strategic balance between Washington and Moscow (based on the ABM treaty and SALT I &amp; II) by proceeding with a plan for national missile defense (NMD). In the last five years, in fact. U.S. military spending has grown rapidly: The defense budget approved by Congress for fiscal year 2001 was more than $50 billion higher than U.S. military spending in 1997. Early indications for fiscal year 2002 (and beyond) suggest further increases. In sum, I agree with Dr. Latham's heuristic argument about there being a contemporary American geopolitical imagination. As he argued at the conference, U.S. policymakers share &quot;a way of reading the global security order that has transformed essentially contestable interpretations of danger ('How serious is the global proliferation threat, relative to other threats?') into 'objective' and incontestable facts regarding the sources of threat and insecurity in the international system (Rogue states possessing WMDs constitute a clear and present danger to the United States).&quot; However, it seems to me that he underestimates how the exaggerated threat provides the best excuse to maintain America's military superiority. In both China and Russia, almost no one has been convinced that NMD is designed only to prevent a threat from a few rogue states. This suspicion was clearly shown in the joint Sino-Russian anti-NMD statement issued in Beijing in July 2000. </span><br />

<strong><span class="Underline">Friend/Enemy dichotomies are necessary for a stable political and intervention at the periphery to limit the effects of violence – The alternative collapses into even greater violence because it pushes these distinctions underground, intensifying them </span></strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>William Rasch, 2005</strong> (“Lines in the Sand: Enmity as a Structuring Principle” The South Atlantic Quarterly 104:2, Spring 2005.) Accepting Cohen’s invitation means deciding on a fundamental distinction that runs through all political philosophy and that has risen once again to the surface in the radical responses to the emerging global order that some want to call Pax Americana and others simply Empire. It is a distinction that Carl Schmitt was keenly aware of; indeed, an unambiguous decision for one alternative over the other structures his entire thought.1 That distinction is between good and evil, or, in the world of ‘‘those’’ about whom Cohen sings, between the presupposition of primordial peace and the presupposition of a war of all against all. In The Concept of the Political, Schmitt concludes that ‘‘all genuine political theories presuppose man to be evil, i.e., by no means an unproblematic but a dangerous and dynamic being.’’2 This anthropological fiction—and Schmitt is aware of the claim’s fictional status—serves as the logical premise that secures Schmitt’s definition of the political as the friend/enemy distinction. We live in a world, he says, in which associations with likeminded others are our only means of security and happiness. Indiscriminate concourse of all with all cannot be the foundation for necessary political discriminations. Thus, the anthropological presupposition of evil, guilt, and violence is designed to expose what Schmitt sees as the duplicity of liberal theory, which consists in using the promise of formal equality to camouflage political power by displacing it in the realms of economics and morality. Liberal theory denies original enmity by assuming the innate goodness of the human being.Those—communitarians and liberals alike— who say there is no war presuppose a counterfactual ‘‘ontological priority of non-violence,’’ a ‘‘state of total peace’’ 3 that invites universal inclusion based on the ‘‘essential homogeneity and natural virtue of mankind.’’ 4 If, in such a benign state of nature, violence were to break out, such violence would be considered a perversion and, if all else were to fail, would have to be extirpated by an even greater violence. x cite John Locke, this ‘‘State of perfect Freedom’’ and universal ‘‘Equality,’’ governed solely by reason and natural law, can be disturbed only by an ‘‘Offender’’ who ‘‘declares himself to live by another Rule, than that of reason and common Equity.’’ Such a ‘‘Criminal’’ has ‘‘declaredWar against allMankind, and therefore may be destroyed as a Lyon or a Tyger, one of those wild Savage Beasts, with whomMen can have no Society nor Security.’’ 5 The political, on this view, emerges only as the result of the Fall—that is, emerges only to fight the war against war, a war always initiated by a sinful or bestial other. It seeks to make itself superfluous by restoring or, more progressively, establishing for the first time this natural order of peace. Should one demur and find the perfect state to be less than advertised, then one’s demurral would most assuredly be recognized not as legitimate political opposition, but rather as evidence of greed, moral perversity, or some other pathological behavior. With its pacific presuppositions, liberalism, according to Schmitt, dissolves the specificity of the political and hides the necessarily asymmetric power relations that mark all political maneuverings. By way of an anthropological sleight of hand, liberalism represents itself as an ethos, a moral and economic emancipation, and not as what it really is, namely, a powerpolitical regime with traditional power-political aims. For Schmitt, distinctions, rather than the effacement of distinctions, structure the space within which we live, including the space of the political. Only within structured space, space literally marked by human activities, by human groupings and the boundaries they draw, do terms achieve their meanings. Norms, he repeatedly stated, are derived from situations, normal situations; they are not derived logically from underived first principles. Categories like ‘‘liberty’’ and ‘‘equality’’ can have political significance only when defined and delineated within the sphere of the political. They are neither natural nor innately human qualities; they are not self-evident truths. Consequently, Schmitt’s suspicion of liberalism, pacifism, or any other -ism that denies an initial and therefore ever-present potential war of all against all is a suspicion of those who wish to make their operative distinctions invisible, and thus incontestable, by claiming the immorality or illegality of all distinction. Schmitt’s insistence, then, on our ‘‘evil’’ nature is evidence neither of his existential misanthropy nor even, necessarily, of his conservative authoritarianism, but rather of his desire to secure the autonomy and necessity of that human mechanism called ‘‘the political.’’ To the question of whether there is a war, Schmitt emphatically answers ‘‘yes’’—by which he means to affirm not armed conflict or bloodshed as a virtue in and of itself, but rather the necessity of the view that the proverbial state of nature is, as Hobbes knew, a state marked by imperfection, and that this imperfection manifests itself as violence and the guilt associated with it. Schmitt, then, starts fromthe premise of imperfection and acknowledges an ontological priority of violence. If, he reasons, one starts with the rather biblical notions of sin and guilt, not natural innocence, then homogeneity, being contingent, historical, and not the least natural, must be predicated on heterogeneity. That is, citizenship or participation or community must be constructed, not assumed, and can only be local, circumscribed, not global. One recognizes one’s own in the face of the other and knows the comfort of inclusion only as the necessary result of exclusion—though in modern, functionally differentiated society, those inclusions and exclusions may be multiple, contradictory, and not necessarily tied to place. ‘‘An absolute human equality,’’ Schmitt writes in his Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy, ‘‘would be an equality without the necessary correlate of inequality and as a result conceptually and practically meaningless, an indifferent equality. . . . Substantive inequalities would in no way disappear from the world and the state; they would shift into another sphere, perhaps separated from the political and concentrated in the economic, leaving this area to take on a new, disproportionately decisive importance.’’ 6 This, Schmitt’s, is not a popular sentiment, even if it echoes somewhat the Marxist distinction between a political and a social democracy, between a formal and substantial equality. But if one acknowledges that at least within modernity all inclusion requires exclusion, that inclusions and exclusions in addition to being unavoidable are also contingent and malleable, then rather than react with dismay, one might see in this ‘‘logical fact,’’ if fact it is, both the condition for the possibility of dissent and the condition for the possibility of recognizing in the one who resists and disagrees a fellow human being and thus legitimate political opponent, not a Lyon or Tyger or other Savage Beast. For it is not that exclusions are miraculously made absent once distinctions are not formally drawn. On the contrary, unacknowledged distinctions, and those who are distinguished by them, simply go underground, become invisible, and grow stronger, more absolute, in their violent and explosive force. When the retrograde and condemned distinction between the ‘‘Greek’’ and the ‘‘barbarian’’ becomes a simple, sanguine affirmation of humanity, this ideal affirmation actually turns out to be nothing other than a distinction drawn between all those who, by their right behavior, show themselves to be truly ‘‘human’’ and those who, alas, by their perverse dissent, have revealed themselves to be evildoers, to be ‘‘inhuman.’’ Deliberate, visible, ‘‘external’’ distinctions that demarcate a space in which a ‘‘we’’ can recognize its difference from a ‘‘they,’’ preferably without marking that difference in a necessarily asymmetrical manner, are to be preferred, in Schmitt’s world, to the invisible and unacknowledged distinctions that mark those who are exemplary humans from those who, by their political dissent, show themselves to be gratuitously perverse. For reasons, then, of making difference visible, Schmitt favors lines drawn in the sand, or, in the ‘‘mythical language’’ used in The Nomos of the Earth, ‘‘firm lines’’ in the ‘‘soil,’’ ‘‘whereby definite divisions become apparent,’’ and, above them, on the ‘‘solid ground of the earth,’’ ‘‘fences, enclosures, boundaries, walls, houses, and other constructs,’’ so that the ‘‘orders and orientations of human social life become apparent’’ and the ‘‘forms of power and domination become visible.’’7 In Nomos, Schmitt describes the now much maligned and seldom mourned European nation-state systemas ‘‘the highest form of orderwithin the scope of human power’’ (187). Historically, the territorial state developed as a response to the religious civil wars of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Once thought of as a unity called Christendom, Europe became fractured by the events of the Reformation and Counter- Reformation. The old asymmetrical distinction between believers and nonbelievers that governed the relationship not only between Christians and non-Christians, but also between Christian orthodoxy and heresy, now threatened to regulate the distinction between Catholics and Protestants. Yet, miraculously (one might be tempted to say), with the conclusion of religious warfare in 1648, a symmetrical relationship among the European nation-states prevailed—in theory, if not always in fact. It is this symmetrical ordering of internally differentiated Europe that Schmitt highlights. In effect—and Hobbes had already described it in these terms—the war of all individuals against all individuals in the state of nature, which perennially threatens to resurface within the state as civil discord, is elevated into a war of all states against all states in a second-order state of nature. In theory and practice, then, the individual is protected from arbitrary and irrational, because incalculable, violence by states acting as moral persons living in an unregulated but serendipitously achieved balance of power. We might best update Schmitt’s description of this order as an ideally anarchic, self-regulating coexistence of antagonistic powers, an emergent, horizontal self-organization of sovereign systems with no one system serving as sovereign over all the others—a plurality of states that refused to coalesce into one single state but rather achieved relative security without relinquishing autonomy. The ‘‘medium’’ of this self-organization was violence (war); yet, by virtue of mechanisms of reciprocity, by virtue, that is, of a similarly emergent self-regulation of violence called international law (the jus publicum Europaeum of which Schmitt sings his praises), the conduct of warfare among European states was restrained and controlled. Thus, the nation-state way of organizing earlymodern Europe served as the katechon, the political as restrainer, establishing relative stability and peace to stave off chaos and civil war. How is this possible? Despite its internal self-differentiation, Europe still saw itself as a unity because of a second major distinction, the one between Europe and the New World, where New World denotes the entire non-European world, but especially the newly ‘‘discovered’’ regions of the globe following Columbus’s three voyages. This distinction was asymmetrical; on the one side we find Christianity and culture, on the other only pagan ‘‘barbarians.’’ How did Europeans mark this difference between a self-differentiated ‘‘us’’ and a homogenous ‘‘them’’? Through violence. Only now, violence was regulated hierarchically by the traditional ‘‘just war’’ doctrine. Schmitt clearly marks the difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical modes of warfare (thus the difference between warfare ‘‘this side’’ versus the ‘‘other side’’ of so-called amity lines that separated Old Europe from the New World) as the difference between wars fought against ‘‘just enemies’’ and those fought for a ‘‘just cause.’’ The former recognize a commonality among combatants that allows for reciprocity; the latter does not. Wars fought against enemies one respects as occupiers of the same cultural ‘‘space,’’ no matter how subdivided, allows for the desirable constraints on the conduct of war. Wars fought against infidels, pagans, and barbarians, whether these barbarians deny the one God, the laws of nature, the truth of reason, or the higher morality of liberalism, are wars fought against those who are not to be respected or accorded the rights granted equals.8 To be in possession of truth, no matter how much that truth is debated internally, allows one to stand over against the other as a conglomerated unity. This self-differentiated unity can assume the restrained and restraining order of civilization because it has inoculated itself against outbreaks of ‘‘natural’’ and lawless violence by displacing them in the New World. America, as Hobbes and others imagined it, was the preeminent site of the feared state of nature; thus Europe was spared any recurrence of the civil wars that had previously ravaged it. What Schmitt describes as an enviable achievement—that is, the balanced order of restrained violence within Europe—presupposed the consignment of unrestrained violence to the rest of the world. That is, desired restraint was founded upon sanctioned lack of restraint. If Schmitt, by concentrating on the development of European international law after the religious civil wars, highlights an admirable local result of a disagreeable global process, this can be attributed to his explicit Eurocentrism. But even non- Eurocentrics may be dismayed by the twentieth-century reintroduction of unrestricted violence within Europe itself.The epitome of this return of the repressed may be the midcentury death camp, as Giorgio Agamben maintains, 9 but its initial breakthrough is the Great War of the century’s second decade. For how else can one explain that a traditional European power struggle that started in 1914 as a war fought for state interest should end in 1918–19 as a war fought by ‘‘civilization’’ against its ‘‘barbarian’’ other? And how else can one explain that we have been so eager to replicate this distinction in every war we have fought ever since? If, in other words, we are rightly horrified by the distinction between civilized and uncivilized when it is used to describe the relationship of Old Europe and its colonial subjects, and if we are rightly horrified by the distinction between the human and the in- or subhuman when it is used to discriminate against blacks, Jews, Gypsies, and other so-called undesirables, then why do we persist today in using these very distinctions when combating our latest enemies? Is it merely ironic or in fact profoundly symptomatic that those who most vehemently affirm universal symmetry (equality, democracy) are also more often than not the ones who opt for themost asymmetrical means of locating enemies and conducting war—that is, just wars fought for a just cause? But how are we to respond? For those who say there is no war and who yet find themselves witnessing daily bloodshed, Adornoian asceticism (refraining from participating in the nihilism of the political) or Benjaminian weak, quasi, or other messianism (waiting for the next incarnation of the historical subject [the multitudes?] or the next proletarian general strike [the event?]) would seem to be the answer. To this, however, those who say there is a war can respond only with bewilderment. Waiting for a ‘‘completely new politics’’ 10 and completely new political agents, waiting for the event and the rightmoment to name it, or waiting for universal ontological redemption feelsmuch like waiting for the Second Coming, or,more accurately, for Godot. And have we not all grown weary of waiting? The war we call ‘‘the political,’’ whether nihilist or not, happily goes on while we watch Rome burn. As Schmitt wrote of the relationship of early Christianity to the Roman Empire, ‘‘The belief that a restrainer holds back the end of the world provides the only bridge between the notion of an eschatological paralysis of all human events and a tremendous historical monolith like that of the Christian empire of the Germanic kings’’ (60).One does not need to believe in the virtues of that particular ‘‘historicalmonolith’’ to understand the dangers of eschatological paralysis. But as Max Weber observed firsthand, ascetic quietude leads so often, so quickly, and so effortlessly to the chiliastic violence that knows no bounds;11 and as we have lately observed anew, the millennial messianism of imperial rulers and nomadic partisans alike dominates the contemporary political landscape. The true goal of those who say there is no war is to eliminate the war that actually exists by eliminating those Lyons and Tygers and other Savage Beasts who say there is a war. This war is the truly savage war. It is the war we witness today. No amount of democratization, pacification, or Americanization will mollify its effects, because democratization, pacification, and Americanization are among the weapons used by those who say there is no war to wage their war to end all war. What is to be done? If you are one who says there is a war, and if you say it not because you glory in it but because you fear it and hate it, then your goal is to limit it and its effects, not eliminate it, which merely intensifies it, but limit it by drawing clear lines within which it can be fought, and clear lines between those who fight it and those who don’t, lines between friends, enemies, and neutrals, lines between combatants and noncombatants. There are, of course, legitimate doubts about whether those ideal lines could ever be drawn again; nevertheless, the question that we should ask is not how can we establish perpetual peace, but rather a more modest one: Can symmetrical relationships be guaranteed only by asymmetrical ones? According to Schmitt, historically this has been the case. ‘‘The traditional Eurocentric order of international law is foundering today, as is the old nomos of the earth. This order arose from a legendary and unforeseen discovery of a new world, from an unrepeatable historical event. Only in fantastic parallels can one imagine a modern recurrence, such as men on their way to themoon discovering a new and hitherto unknown planet that could be exploited freely and utilized effectively to relieve their struggles on earth’’ (39). We have since gone to the moon and have found nothing on the way there to exploit. We may soon go to Mars, if current leaders have their way, but the likelihood of finding exploitable populations seems equally slim. Salvation through spatially delimited asymmetry, even were it to be desired, is just not on the horizon. And salvation through globalization, that is, through global unity and equality, is equally impossible, because today’s asymmetry is not so much a localization of the exception as it is an invisible generation of the exception from within that formal ideal of unity, a generation of the exception as the difference between the human and the inhuman outlaw, the ‘‘Savage Beast, with whom Men can have no Society nor Security.’’ We are, therefore, thrown back upon ourselves, which is to say, upon those artificial ‘‘moral persons’’ who act as our collective political identities.They used to be called states.What theywill be called in the future remains to be seen. But, if we think to establish a differentiated unity of discrete political entities that once represented for Schmitt ‘‘the highest form of order within the scope of human power,’’ then we must symmetrically manage the necessary pairing of inclusion and exclusion without denying the ‘‘forms of power and domination’’ that inescapably accompany human ordering.We must think the possibility of roughly equivalent power relations rather than fantasize the elimination of power from the political universe. This, conceivably, was also Schmitt’s solution.Whether his idea of the plurality of Großräume could ever be carried out under contemporary circumstances is, to be sure,more than a little doubtful, given that the United States enjoys a monopoly on guns, goods, and the Good, in the form of a supremely effective ideology of universal ‘‘democratization.’’ Still, we would do well to devise vocabularies that do not just emphatically repeat philosophically more sophisticated versions of the liberal ideology of painless, effortless, universal equality.The space of the political will never be created by a bloodless, Benjaminian divine violence. Nor is it to be confused with the space of the simply human. To dream the dreams of universal inclusion may satisfy an irrepressible human desire, but it may also always produce recurring, asphyxiating political nightmares of absolute exclusion. </span><br />

Because Americans dislike realpolitik, public discourse about foreign policy in the United States is usually couched in the language of liberalism. Hence the pronouncements of the policy elites are heavily flavored with optimism and moralism. American academics are especially good at promoting liberal thinking in the marketplace of ideas. Behind closed doors, however, the elites who make national security policy speak the language of power, not that of principle, and the United States acts in the international system according to the dictates of realist logic. In essence, a discernable gap separates public rhetoric from the actual conduct of American foreign policy.<br />

<strong><span class="Underline">The drive to construct missile defense props up U.S. dominance of the globe and is founded on essentialist, Orientalist representations of the threat of 'rogue states'. </span></strong><br />

<span class="Underline">Andrew Latham's article does not directly discuss the question of U.S. grand strategy; instead, he draws a wonderful picture of the &quot;American geopolitical imagination&quot; for us. It is that imagination that has helped to define American interests, shape perceptions of threat, and inform policy prescriptions in the areas of foreign relations and national defense. His arguments about American perceptions--both of itself and of the Third World--have made a deep impression on me. Particularly notable is his contention that strategic orientalism has shaped American policymakers' perception of the &quot;threat&quot; from so-called rogue states. As his paper suggests, America's self-representation as the &quot;the standard of civilization&quot; is full of arrogance and prejudice. In this way, Latham provides evidence that cultural criticism is a valuable approach for understanding contemporary international relations. In analyzing the contemporary American geopolitical imagination, Latham compares and contrasts the Cold War discourse and the post-Cold War discourse. I use Table 1 to summarize his main points. As we can see, the basic elements of the American geopolitical imagination have not changed so much between the Cold War and post-Cold War discourses. Americans still feel insecure and threatened from outside and still have a kind of Manifest Destiny in desiring to lead the world to a &quot;promised land.&quot; As Latham puts it, &quot;With the end of the Cold War, the key elements of America's geopolitical imagination have been transformed in ways that mark a partial break with the Cold War discourse&quot; (emphasis added). If the contemporary American geopolitical imagination breaks only partially with the Cold War discourse, there is reason to believe that the basic strategic thinking of American policymakers, which was shaped in the Cold War, continues to inform American foreign and defense policy in the new century. Just as no one would deny that the United States had a grand strategy in the Cold War, whether we call it containment or anti-Communism, most foreign observers believe that Washington's actions today are also characterized by some kind of strategy. From the perspective of Chinese analysts, the concept of strategy is based on the common sense meaning of long-term, comprehensive planning. It is obviously beyond the scope of this commentary to provide a detailed defense of the idea that a U.S. grand strategy exists today. Instead, I will simply use Latham's arguments to show how a de facto geopolitical strategy can be derived from the American geopolitical imagination. Specifically, a geopolitical strategy can be identified by answering the following five questions: What are America's objectives? Who are its main rivals? What kinds of threats does the United States have to address? What concept will guide American action? What means will the United States use for achieving its objectives? Just as Latham juxtaposed the Cold War and post-Cold War discourses, so too can we compare and contrast the Cold War and the post-Cold War eras to organize our analysis of U.S. strategy. First, the objectives of U.S. strategy are virtually identical in the Cold War and the post-Cold War eras (see Table 2). If there is any difference, it is that Americans now want to maintain a unipolar world in which U,S. hegemony is unchallenged. Second, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the rogue states became the main rivals of the United States. Given the controversy surrounding this classification, however, American officials now use the term states of concern to replace the concept of rogue states. This change in terminology represents a significant shift in America's perception of its rivals. Unlike the undiplomatic and immoral notion of rogue states, the term states of concern is more flexible and therefore more useful. The new term implies both that the behavior of America's rivals can be modified and that classification of these states depends on particular situations and contexts. In this sense, states of concern could include not only the relatively small countries formerly identified as rogue states but also, in certain cases, larger powers. For example, when the Russians waged war in Chechnya, or if the Chinese were to decide to reunify with Taiwan by force, Russia and China would be considered states of concern in the minds of American policymakers. Third, during the Cold War the greatest threat to the United States came from the Soviet Union, which was seen as an aggressive, militaristic, expansionist, nuclear-armed empire implacably hostile to the United States. Invoking the discourse of the Cold War, American officials have framed policy over the last decade in terms of the need to contain inherently &quot;irrational&quot; Third World states armed with large conventional forces and weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). These states were seen as bent on sabotaging the world order. Fourth, as Latham argued at the July 2000 Emerging From Conflict conference, American policymakers have focused on four principal concepts in their counterproliferation strategy since the mid-1990s: denial, disarmament, deterrence, and defense. Fifth, as far as the means of U.S. policy are concerned, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin was quite explicit in outlining American counterproliferation policy in 1993. In addition to identifying a number of specific military and intelligence initiatives, Aspin noted that diplomacy, treaty restrictions, security assurances, export controls, nonmilitary sanctions, and economic cooperation would also remain important means of preventing, and coping with, the proliferation of WMDs. Relying not .just on its own military capabilities, the United States has also sought to use international regimes (e.g., the Missile Technology Control Regime) to pursue its objectives. On the basis of this analysis, I conclude that U.S. foreign and defense policy is in fact characterized by a geopolitical strategy. With the end of the Cold War, the United States has upgraded (rather than merely maintained) its armaments and Cold War coalitions. By enlarging NATO, it has expanded its zone of defense in Europe. By strengthening its security ties with Japan in the Asia-Pacific, it has expanded its military coverage near the Taiwan Strait. In the Balkans and Central Asia, the United States has infiltrated Russia's traditional sphere of influence. Similarly, it has contained Iran and Iraq both by force and by backing the peace process in the Middle East. In its own backyard, American policymakers have tried to pacify the Caribbean through actions such as intervention in Haiti. As these examples suggest, the United States has clear and coherent diplomatic and military objectives in almost all strategic areas. Furthermore, in spite of strong opposition from Russia, China, and even Germany, the United States has decided to upset the strategic balance between Washington and Moscow (based on the ABM treaty and SALT I &amp; II) by proceeding with a plan for national missile defense (NMD). In the last five years, in fact, U.S. military spending has grown rapidly: The defense budget approved by Congress for fiscal year 2001 was more than $50 billion higher than U.S. military spending in 1997. Early indications for fiscal year 2002 (and beyond) suggest further increases. In sum, I agree with Dr. Latham's heuristic argument about there being a contemporary American geopolitical imagination. As he argued at the conference, U.S. policymakers share &quot;a way of reading the global security order that has transformed essentially contestable interpretations of danger ('How serious is the global proliferation threat, relative to other threats?') into 'objective' and incontestable facts regarding the sources of threat and insecurity in the international system (Rogue states possessing WMDs constitute a clear and present danger to the United States).&quot; However, it seems to me that he underestimates how the exaggerated threat provides the best excuse to maintain America's military superiority. In both China and Russia, almost no one has been convinced that NMD is designed only to prevent a threat from a few rogue states. This suspicion was clearly shown in the joint Sino-Russian anti-NMD statement issued in Beijing in July 2000 </span><br />

<strong>Plan popular – lawmakers hate excessive costs in the MDA budget</strong><br />
<strong>Grossman 8</strong> (Elaine, Global Security Newswire, 11/4, “Congress chides U.S. Missile Defense management”,<span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/1108/110408gsn1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/1108/110408gsn1.htm</a></span>)<br />
Lawmakers scolded the Missile Defense Agency for a number of management problems and trimmed its budget in a recently enacted fiscal 2009 appropriations bill. The appropriations bill criticized several aspects of missile defense operations, including funding priorities in the MDA budget request, flight-test delays and cancellations, and the availability of target missiles for use in testing. Overall, Congress gave $9.02 billion to the Defense Department's missile defense arm for the new fiscal year, a figure that largely satisfied agency advocates. &quot;The reduction was only $320.6 million out of a $9.3 billion request,&quot; MDA spokesman Rick Lehner told Global Security Newswire last week. While some missile defense projects saw their annual budgets decreased, &quot;the programs all were funded [at some level] ... so we were pleased,&quot; he said. However, others characterized the level of funding as excessive. &quot;It's too much money for missile defense,&quot; said John Isaacs, executive director of the Council for a Livable World. He said that despite billions of dollars in annual funding, long-range defense systems that receive the bulk of MDA money have not yet proven technically feasible at intercepting a complex attack. Such attacks could include decoys or other countermeasures aimed at confusing missile defense sensors.<br />

TMD Undermines Arms Control. The most articulate expression of Chinese sentiments comes from Ambassador Shu Zukang, who asserts that “the U.S. development of missile defenses does not contribute to global stability nor will it serve the interests of the U.S. itself.” 47He contends that NMD/TMD violates the 1972 ABM treaty, considered by the Chinese as “the most important arms control protocol being implemented,” and that the loss of this treaty will lead to a disruption of the strategic balance between the United States and Russia.48 This will, in turn, result in a greater instability for all countries. Specifically, Sha asks, “How can you expect progress in arms control and nonproliferation while you yourself are developing NMD at full steam? It is just wishful thinking.”49Shu also hinted that rather than engaging in an arms race, should the United States proceed with its NMD/TMD deployments, “it would be quite possible for China to review its policies on various arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation issues, including FMCT negotiations.”50Chinese officials also assert that TMD deployments will lead to a complete halt in global arms control and nonproliferation, with direct implications for START II, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Missile Technology Control Regime and Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty. Chinese officials have gone so far as to declare “NMD will also causemany nations to build up their nuclear forces and further retard the disarmament process.” 51 Significantly, China avoids any overtures to participate in multilateral ABM controls and continues to upgrade Soviet designed surface-to-air (SAM) missiles for the ballistic missile defense role. Since the U.S.-Russian agreement on threshold testing of missile defense systems clarified permitted capabilities, Chinese arguments about undermining the ABM Treaty have lost their relevance. 52 China shows deep concern that should TMD/NMD undermine the ABM Treaty, then Russian ratification of START II and participation in START III would be obviated, with negative consequences for Beijing. Specifically, by withdrawing from the START III preliminaries, the Russian threat to the northern Chinese border would return, albeit on a smaller scale than during the 1960s to 1990s rift between the two. This would divert Chinese resources from development and modernization and inhibit the current free flow of technology and capital between them.53 TMD missile legitimacy also received a challenge under the 1987 MTCR. Some states construed TMD development as a form of missile proliferation. The United States maintains that<br />
TMD development protocols do not constitute a violation of the MTCR and will not contribute to missile proliferation.54<br />
<strong>2) US-Japan missile defense causes Russia to withdraw from START- leads to global arms race, destroys relations</strong><br />
<strong>Blank 9</strong> – Dr. Stephen Blank , Research Professor of National Security Affairs at the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College, March 2009, “Russia And Arms Control: Are There Opportunities For The Obama Administration?,” online: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:7927:http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:7927 --><br />
As McDonough showed above, U.S. force deployments in the Pacific theater definitely threaten Russian nuclear assets and infrastructure as well as its territory and conventional forces.243 A second major Russian concern is the strengthening of the U.S.-Japan alliance in the twin forms ofjoint missile defenses and the apparent consolidation of a tripartite or possibly quadripartite alliance including Australia and South Korea, if not India. In that context, both Moscow and Beijing worry that North Korean nuclearization might lead Japan to build nuclear weapons. But beyond that, for both Russia and China, one of the most visible negative consequences of the DPRK’s nuclear and missile tests has been the strengthened impetus it gave to U.S.-Japan cooperation on missile defense. The issue of missile defense in Asia had been in a kind of abeyance until the North Korean nuclear tests of 2006. These tests, taken in defiance of Chinese warnings against nuclearization and testing, intensified and accelerated U.S.-Japanese collaboration on missile defenses as the justification for them had now been incontrovertibly demonstrated. But such programs always entail checking China’s nuclear capabilities and even, according to Beijing, threatening it with a first strike. Naturally those developments greatly annoy China.244 Therefore China continues publicly to criticize U.S.-Japan collaboration on missile defenses.245 Perhaps this issue was on Chinese President Hu Jintao’s agenda in September 2007 when he called for greater Russo-Chinese cooperation in Asia-Pacific security.246 His remarks may have prompted Russia to act or speak out against these trends in Asia for Russia, having hitherto been publicly reticent to comment on this missile defense cooperation or to attack the U.S. alliance system in Asia, reacted quite strongly.247 During Lavrov’s visit to Japan in October 2007 and despite his strong pitch for Russo-Japanese economic cooperation, he publicly warned that Russia fears that this missile defense system represents an effort to ensure American military superiority and that the development and deployment of such systems could spur regional and global arms races. Lavrov also noted that Russia pays close attention to the U.S.-Japan alliance and was worried by the strengthening of the triangle comprising both these states and Australia.248 He observed that “a closed format for military and political alliances” does not facilitate peace and “will not be able to increase mutual trust in the region,” thereby triggering reactions contrary to the expectations of Washington, Tokyo, and Canberra.249 More recently, at the 2008 annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum (ARF) in Singapore, Lavrov again inveighed against “narrow military alliances,” claiming that Asian-Pacific security should be all-inclusive and indivisible, the work of all interested parties, not blocs. Any such activity must enhance strategic balance and take account of everyone’s interests and be based on international law, i.e., the Security Council where Moscow has a veto.250 Lavrov’s complaints show what happens when bilateral cooperation breaks down and, as a result of proliferation, overall regional tensions increase, in this case in Northeast Asia. Russia has responded to the U.S. missile defense program in both Europe and Asia by MIRVing its existing and older ICBMs, (that is, putting so called MIRVs [missiles] onto its missiles in silos) leaving the START-2 treaty, creating hypersonic missiles that allegedly can break through any American missile defense system, introducing new Topol-Ms mobile ICBMs that also allegedly can break those defenses, and testing the Bulava SLBM with similar characteristics. Still Moscow apparently thought this was not enough, and only 6 weeks after Lavrov’s public complaints in Japan, Vice-Premier Sergei Ivanov called for nuclear parity with Washington, even though the quest for such parity would undoubtedly undermine Russia’s economy unless he meant the retention of strategic stability, albeit at unequal numbers of missiles. Nevertheless, the real threat for Moscow here is the U.S. policy to build missile defenses and an alliance excluding Russia and China, not Japanese missile defenses. Those defenses are mainly directed formally against North Korean missiles and in reality the threat of Chinese missiles, not Russia.<br />

Second, a somewhat different congressionalist or Congress-centered view comes from recent research on presidential legislative success with Congress. As we will examine in more detail below, some recent studies have shown that the most important explanations of what happens to presidential proposals or positions have to do with the partisan and ideological composition of Congress rather than characteristics of the presidency. That is to say, the outcomes of the legislative process are more a function of the composition of Congress than the president's popularity or margin of electoral victory.<br />

Besides not considering the full range of available views, members of Congress are not generally in a position to make trade-offs between policies.Because of its decentralization, Congress usually considers policies serially, that is, without reference to other policies. Wtihout an integrating mechanism, members have few means by which to set and enforce priorities and to emphasize the policies with which the president is most concerned.<br />

<u>Obama</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> claims this has changed. He says he </span><u>wants a world free of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> all </span><u>nuclear weapons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (an objective that has gathered significant global support recently, as illustrated by the work of Gareth Evans’s International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament). But Obama also says he will be prudent and adopt a step-by-step approach; in particular, the United States will maintain a robust nuclear deterrent until complete nuclear disarmament arrives – which, of course, may never happen. In the meantime, Obama recognises there is much that can be done to move things forward, such as ratifying a ban on the testing of nuclear weapons and making more cuts to the numbers of nuclear weapons. Then there is related policy that can positively affect the political atmosphere, such as his decision to shelve Bush’s scheme for a missile defence system based in central Europe. But what about the guidance the Obama administration gives to the military about the purpose of the nuclear weapons stockpile and how it might be used? In particular, what about first-use? </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Most of the NPT</span></u> <u>membership <span style="background-color: yellow;">want a clear</span> statement of <span style="background-color: yellow;">no-first-use</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> They want all nuclear threats de-legitimised, and they have no time for Washington’s old claim that its first-use option is a foundation of world order. They have had enough of what they see as American hypocrisy. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Pentagon hardliners</span></u><u>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">and </span>their allies in <span style="background-color: yellow;">conservative</span> think-tank<span style="background-color: yellow;">s</span>, don’t like what they are hearing</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Old-school analysts <span style="background-color: yellow;">fear a policy of no-first-use</span> would unravel the world order</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that has evolved since the 1950s. </span><u>They worry the result would be to encourage rogue states to push their luck, and possibly to spook countries like Japan into building their own nuclear weapons.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This shouldn’t come as a surprise to Obama or anyone else. Although the Pentagon is required to follow presidential instructions, it isn’t the Department of Defense’s job simply to assume that a benign security environment will emerge and make radical disarmament sensible. And part of the Pentagon sees its core business as protecting an existing nuclear order which it views as essential for international stability. Where does all this leave us? For Obama</span><u>, making large cuts to nuclear force levels will be easy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as everyone agrees the arsenal is too bloated. Just how far the cuts should go is a matter of opinion, although the precise numbers needed are a second-order issue. </span><u>But abolishing nuclear weapons is impossible for many years to come, <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">so Obama will not invest his</span> limited <span style="background-color: yellow;">political capital trying</span></strong>, although he will stress elimination as a long-term aspiration.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The most interesting area of potential change concerns the missions assigned to nuclear weapons. This is where the real fight could be. </span><u>Deciding on the role of the weapons is a more profound issue than whether Obama leaves office overseeing an arsenal of 1000 or 4000 nuclear warheads.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The central question is whether or not these weapons should be reined in and kept only to deter nuclear attack by others. Or should they continue to have a wider purpose? Should they continue to be seen as a tool for managing world order, which has meant using them to threaten countries like Iran as a way of underlining US hegemony and, supposedly, providing additional discipline to the international system? Obama apparently believes business as usual is unwise, immoral and unsustainable. One reason for this is that inaction could contribute to the NPT’s disintegration. The treaty is already under pressure, partly because of the collapse of US credibility under the previous administration. Today there is enormous hope that Obama can repair the damage; the sense is that it requires someone of his standing to restore faith in American non-proliferation diplomacy. But this could require knocking into line anyone in the Pentagon continuing to insist that it is useful for the United States to threaten to start a nuclear war. </span><u>Only time will tell whether Obama has the political room and stamina to do this while also addressing the financial mess</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, healthcare reform, </span><u>global warming, and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Seeking three treaties on nuclear arms control in his first term will not be easy.

<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">The Drawbacks of No First Use Some participants argued that the United States should not adopt a NFU doctrine, because </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">although the Soviet Union is no longer a threat, we cannot be sure what the future security environment will look like. </span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">One conference participant argued that a more sensible position would be a posture of “defensive last resort,” as proposed in a 1993 <em>Foreign Affairs</em> article by McGeorge Bundy, William Crowe, and Sidney Drell. That article argued: “In recognizing the possibility of a future case in which there might be justification for a use of nuclear weapons in a defensive last resort, we are simply resisting the notion that our country can be certain, <em>a priori</em>, that there will never be a case when such use might be the least bad choice.” Some conference participants questioned whether there really was such uncertainty in the post-Cold War world. </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">They argued that it was highly unlikely that “Stalin might come back” or that the United States would be faced with an overwhelming conventional threat that could only be offset with nuclear weapons.</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Indeed, pressed to describe specific scenarios that might require the first use of nuclear weapons, conference members initially could not think of any because the </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">United States possesses overwhelming conventional superiority</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Subsequently, they outlined a situation in which the US military, already fighting in two theaters (e.g., the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula), was faced with yet another major conflict. However, there was disagreement over the importance of this and similar scenarios, with some participants warning that an overabundance of caution—a fear of highly improbable scenarios—can lead to irrational policy. One participant countered that, were such a situation to arise, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">we could always revoke our NFU policy</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. However, that possibility immediate raised the problem of whether a NFU doctrine was credible because it could be so easily changed. Another participant noted that </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">in a crisis situation, r<span style="background-color: yellow;">evocation</span> of NFU <span style="background-color: yellow;">would be seen as</span> threatening and <span style="background-color: yellow;">escalatory,</span> much like mating warheads to missiles.</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Nevertheless, before we adopt a NFU posture, we must ask whether our conventional forces can fulfill the first-use role nuclear weapons have traditionally played. Most conference participants thought they could, given US power-projection capabilities. Moreover, given the extreme consequences of being the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict, the United States is extremely unlikely to do so, even if there were some military advantage. But other participants worried that conventional weapons could not fulfill US security guarantees as well as nuclear weapons. A conventional guarantee is a promise to fight a war with an ally, on that ally’s territory; the United States and its ally would likely win the conflict, but the ally’s population and territory would suffer horribly. By contrast, a nuclear security guarantee presents a potential enemy with an existential threat to <em>its</em> territory and is therefore more likely to <em>prevent</em> war. During the Cold War, nuclear weapons deterred the Soviet Union from invading Germany because it was likely that nuclear retaliation would destroy the entire Soviet Union. A nonnuclear NATO would not have had the same deterrent effect. While that particular force imbalance was unique to the Cold War, conference participants noted that the United States does not have enough conventional power to deter a North Korean invasion of South Korea. In addition, the United States can only deploy overwhelming conventional power to certain locations because it relies heavily on air and sea forces, which have limited range. For example, US forces would be unable to fight their way to Tehran if that were needed. Several participants disagreed with this assessment, with one arguing that comparing a nuclear umbrella with the ability to occupy territory is like comparing apples and oranges. While it may not be possible to actually invade Iran with ground troops, the United States can deliver massive destruction by air anywhere in the world. That capability, although conventional, has a strong deterrent effect. We can threaten to fly 80,000 conventional air assault sorties while taking very few casualties and we can knock out a country’s electricity grids, go after its political and military leadership, attack the enemy government’s power base, and so forth. Although it requires more sorties and more time, this capability is akin to a nuclear capability, posing a threat severe enough to affect the calculations of any rational actor. According to one participant, if deterrence hinges upon the ability to destroy things from the air, then “it’s pretty hard to find a case where you can’t do something devastating by conventional means.” In response, one participant mentioned that a conventional security guarantee might not be enough to protect Georgia against a Russian attack. However, the same participant noted that extending our nuclear umbrella over Georgia, if it joined NATO, would pose a number of other complications, not the least of which is the prospect of Russian escalation during a conflict. Along those lines, several participants pointed out that nuclear weapons cannot always make up for the deficiencies of conventional forces. For example, the US nuclear arsenal did not deter North Korea from invading South Korea, nor did the United States use nuclear weapons against the North. Today, using nuclear weapons in such a situation would destroy the entire Korean Peninsula, so we still cannot credibly contemplate a nuclear response. Likewise, US nuclear weapons did not deter Saddam Hussein from invading Kuwait. Thus, our hypothetical retaliatory scenarios are couched in abstract, existential terms—as is the habit of nuclear strategists—but this mode of analysis may be inappropriate in actual situations. Given the tradition of nonuse that has developed, some participants noted that we are essentially reliant on conventional arms for deterrence anyway. We are restrained by the fact that any nuclear first use would change the world in a dramatically negative way. They suggested that it would be worthwhile to go through every possible scenario and ask whether nuclear first use is actually militarily useful option, in contrast to available conventional options. Additionally, participants emphasized that security guarantees are not just a function of the relationship between the United States and the country it hopes to deter; they are also a function of how secure the ally under our protection feels. As one participant put it, “What we think about our umbrella isn’t important. What’s important is what our allies think our umbrella is like.” Such concerns drove policy during the Cold War—for example, when the United States deployed Pershing missiles to reassure our European allies that their security was not being decoupled from ours. Today it is essential that our nuclear doctrine reassure allies like Japan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Taiwan that they do not need nuclear weapons—lest they develop their own arsenals and undercut the nuclear nonproliferation regime. Conference participants were divided over the effect that a NFU pledge would have on this priority. According to several, a NFU security guarantee— which promises that we will defend our allies with nuclear weapons only if they are attacked with nuclear weapons—need not undermine the security of US key allies and friends in the future, given the United States’ overwhelming conventional superiority. However, they did emphasize that US security guarantees are an extremely sensitive subject for key US allies, especially Japan, South Korea, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and members of NATO. The Japanese prime minister’s threat to withdraw from the NPT during the 1998 North Korea crisis underscores this point, as does Condoleezza Rice’s 2006 trip to Tokyo in the wake of North Korea’s nuclear test, in which she reassured Japan’s leaders of the US commitment to “the full range of its defense and security commitments to Japan.” But would NFU actually undermine security assurances? As with their questions about the impact NFU would have on norms, conference participants were struck by the lack of available empirical data—by how little we really know about what our allies think of this issue. It is necessary to collect more evidence to validate or invalidate the contention that Japan, for example, would feel less assured if the United States adopted a NFU posture. It would also be particularly useful to get more data on India, which has publicly rationalized its nuclear posture changes in terms of US posture changes. If the United States adopted a NFU posture, would India follow suit, or would it conveniently forget the linkage it had previously drawn with other great-power nuclear doctrines? Could NFU encourage positive changes in the nuclear doctrines of other countries? Some conference participants worried that </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">adopting NFU might</span></u><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> actually <em><span style="background-color: yellow;">encourage </span></em><span style="background-color: yellow;">proliferation by weakening security assurances</span> or by suggesting a shortcut for a weak state to match our military capability</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. One participant speculated that this is a natural consequence of US conventional superiority and that we should consider how to redress those security imbalances. Other participants argued that the </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">US nuclear posture is basically irrelevant</span></u><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> as it relates to this problem: no matter what the US nuclear posture is, s<span style="background-color: yellow;">tates will see</span> nuclear <span style="background-color: yellow;">weapons as a</span> way <span style="background-color: yellow;">of offsetting America’</span>s c<span style="background-color: yellow;">onventional</span> military <span style="background-color: yellow;">superiority.</span> </span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">One participant questioned whether adopting a NFU posture in the current political environment is wise. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">If the</span></u><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background-color: yellow;">adopts NFU</span> in 2009 in the midst of a withdrawal from Iraq, troubles in Afghanistan, and an economic crisis, <span style="background-color: yellow;">it might contribute to a </span>general <span style="background-color: yellow;">perception that the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">St</span>ates <span style="background-color: yellow;">is weakening</span> and its assurances are less credible.</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> The United States has been militarily aggressive since the 9/11 attacks but that does not mean our assurances are more credible. </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">There is <span style="background-color: yellow;">uncertainty about US nonproliferation policy</span> and almost no trust in US intelligence</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Elites abroad do not know what to believe when the United States makes statements about its intentions. </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">While our goal of a NFU pledge would be to devalue nuclear weapons, discourage proliferation, and lock in US conventional superiority, other states might not interpret the move that way. A NFU pledge might simply signal that a weakened United States had lost its nerve. </span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Does It Really Matter? According to some conference participants, whatever Global Strike, and efforts to develop low-yield and earth-penetrating weapons have led to the common impression that the current policies have lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons. However, a few participants argued that top US officials have become largely indifferent to nuclear weapons and pointed out that they were not mentioned in the 2002 National Security Strategy. Although US officials have said “all options are on the table” with regard to Iran, the senior staffs of the Rumsfeld and Gates Pentagons have considered nuclear weapons unusable. According to this view, Global Strike includes a nuclear option only because it is technically expedient to integrate a conventional ICBM capability with the system that does nuclear targeting, and nuclear weapons are included in other war plans simply because the administration’s default view is that it is good to have military options. Many conference participants disagreed with this view, but they noted that, if true, it had significant implications for NFU. One pointed out that indifference toward nuclear doctrine might be as bad as a policy of nuclear preemption because it engenders a lack of discipline that allows junior war planners to contemplate a wide range of uses for nuclear weapons and send the wrong signal about when we would use them. Indeed, noted one participant, if the current nuclear weapons policy is actually one of strategic ambiguity or defensive last resort, then the US administration should spell that out publicly so that the United States does not suffer from the perception that it has an aggressive nuclear stance. Likewise, participants noted that perceptions of current nuclear policy are undercutting the officially-stated desire to impress upon terrorists and rogue states a debate about the moral legitimacy of nuclear arms. </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Some participants were not sure that NFU would measurably reduce the salience of nuclear weapons.</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> For example, nuclear weapons certainly affect the relationship between India and Pakistan, and their nuclear weapons are not even deployed. Moreover, </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">when Russia and India declared that they would no longer adhere to a NFU posture, the effect—negative or positive—on the international community was negligible.</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> One participant recalled a meeting in Norway on reducing the salience of nuclear weapons, in which the representatives of Asian countries were unenthusiastic about NFU. </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Instead,</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> they said </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">the key to delegitimizing nuclear weapons was to get them out of the hands of the military and remove them from war plans.</span></u> <u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">To that end, <span style="background-color: yellow;">rather than changing</span> declared <span style="background-color: yellow;">doctrine, the U</span>nited <span style="background-color: yellow;">St</span>ates <span style="background-color: yellow;">should focus on</span> programmatic <span style="background-color: yellow;">steps toward a less aggressive</span> nuclear <span style="background-color: yellow;">posture</span></span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">—cutting the Reliable Replacement Warhead, </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">de-alerting nuclear weapons, developing conventional means </span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">to cover every possible contingency except for nuclear attack,</span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> and so forth.</span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> The United States should strive to emphasize, with words and actions, that “the purpose of nuclear weapons is to ensure that they are never used.” Participants said that such a policy would stated doctrine may be, the default US nuclear posture is a defensive last resort simply because American officials would not consider using nuclear weapons except under the most dire of circumstances. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, other nuclear planning documents, have the virtue of reducing the salience of nuclear weapons while remaining more realistic and honest about possible nuclear use in extenuating circumstances. Many participants emphasized the realist’s perspective that, despite our attempts to reduce the salience of nuclear weapons, many countries do not see nuclear weapons as a tool to “ensure that nuclear weapons are never used,” but rather as an essential guarantee of their security against conventional attack. For example, a </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">US NFU doctrine will have no effect on Israel’s nuclear strategy. </span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Likewise, </span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Russia sees its nuclear weapons as a way to offset the erosion of its conventional military strength. This applies to states like North Korea and Iran as well. Their nuclear programs are, </span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">in large part,</span><u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> a response to US conventional military might, so <span style="background-color: yellow;">a change in US nuclear doctrine is unlikely to affect their</span> own <span style="background-color: yellow;">nuclear decisions</span>. </span></u><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Yet, although states will pursue their national interests, there are a number of states, like Ukraine and South Africa, that saw it in their interest to renounce nuclear weapons and sign the NPT. The United States can convince states to renounce their nuclear options by tailoring its nonproliferation policies to each individual country’s security concerns. In this way the United States could also prevent a nuclear domino effect if one state does go nuclear. By addressing Japan’s and South Korea’s security interests, for example, the United States can reduce the likelihood that North Korea’s nuclear program will spark proliferation throughout East Asia. The relevance of NFU lies in how it contributes to this tailored nonproliferation calculus. Most participants expressed the opinion that NFU and other elements of US nuclear posture must be important insofar as they set the stage for the United States to hold other countries to their nonproliferation commitments and how they affect states’ decisions about whether or not to fully embrace the nonproliferation regime. Even if states gain and maintain nuclear arsenals based on their own security interests, some participants pointed out, that does not mean the United States should dismiss the importance of norms: “I don’t think we should simply say that the Cold War worked out fine, deterrence held, and that the Pakistanis and the Indians should replicate the experience of the United States and Russia.” In addition, participants were overwhelmingly of the opinion that the most important items to address while setting the stage for the 2010 NPT Review Conference are ratification of the CTBT and steps toward the denuclearization of North Korea and Iran. NFU factors into that calculus, but it is definitely lower on the list. </span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As significant as the wholesale changes in force structure and training are, indications that PRC nuclear doctrine and weapon employment policy may also be changing are potentially even more important. </span><span class="underline0">While much remains similar to what is known of historical Chinese nuclear doctrine</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, particularly as this relates to assured second-strike operations, </span><span class="underline0">there seems to be an evolution in thinking regarding the use of tactical nuclear weapons, particularly in a non-retaliatory manner</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In doctrinal discussions of the nuclear counterstrike campaign, the prerequisites, elements, goals, and targets all seem quite in accord with historical doctrine. </span><span class="underline0">The principal prerequisite</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of course, </span><span class="underline0">derives from the no-first-use </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(NFU) </span><span class="underline0">policy: 'According to China's principled position of “no-first-use of nuclear weapons”, the nuclear counterattack campaign of the Second Artillery will be conducted under the circumstances when an enemy has launched a nuclear attack on us.'</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">122 The campaign elements of centralized command at the highest level, rapid response, dedicated protection of strategic assets, and key point targeting all also fit well into China's legacy doctrine.123 </span><span class="underline0">While the element of 'rapid response' has the appearance of being a newer feature of the PRC's assured second-strike doctrine, in reality it only reflects the qualitative change in the composition of the force, which itself is a response to enhance survivability in the face of modern precision warfare.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Additionally, the goals and targets of the nuclear counterattack campaign do not seem to have deviated much from historical values, driven by the guiding objective 'to implement a nuclear counterattack on the enemy's important strategic and campaign objectives, set back the enemy's strategic intention, shake the enemy's willpower of war, paralyze the enemy's command system, delay the combat movement of the enemy, weaken the enemy's war potential, and contain the escalation of nuclear war'.124 Thus, while most of the doctrinal details that have recently come to light may not have been well understood by Western analysts, nothing in the assured second-strike doctrine has the flavor of representing a novel discontinuity with past doctrine. Assured second-strike retaliation, as a doctrine, seems to have followed a logical evolution along the lines required in going from a small, silo-based, relatively static intercontinental force to a larger, more survivable mobile one. Where the groundwork is possibly being prepared for making substantive modifications to historical PRC nuclear doctrine and nuclear use policy is in the areas of tactical and theater nuclear warfare and the provisos being proposed against NFU. In his recent, extensive treatment of the subject, Zhao Xijun states, much in agreement with established doctrine, that </span><span class="underline0">the goal of China's deterrent missile force is to 'shake the enemy psychologically, vacillate the enemy's war volition, weaken the enemy commander's operational determination, disturb the enemy psyche and public psyche, and achieve [the objective of]“conquering without fighting”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">'.125 Additionally, </span><span class="underline0">however</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Zhao states, </span><span class="underline0">'the goal of wartime deterrence is to prevent conventional war from escalating into nuclear war, and to prevent low-intensity nuclear war from further escalating'</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.126 </span><span class="underline0">Thus </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">conceived</span><span class="underline0">, credible deterrence imposes stringent requirements on the Chinese nuclear postur</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">e, including an adequate force size and composition, survivability, plausible targeting, and highly reliable (and survivable) nuclear command and control. Moreover, </span><span class="underline0">Zhao states that a 'flexible application' of deterrence across all levels of war, from the strategic down to the tactical, is 'indispensable [for] effective and credible deterrence'</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.127 Similarly, </span><span class="underline0">another Chinese doctrinal publication makes a deliberate distinction between a large-scale nuclear and a small-scale nuclear counterattack campaign.128 Such a view approaches a limited view of nuclear warfighting (not minimum deterrence)</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,129 </span><span class="underline0">particularly since low-intensity nuclear war and de-escalatory measures are mentioned. Indeed, recent articles in Chinese military journals have discussed a wide variety of nuclear deterrence strategies, with some authors using the term 'effective counter-nuclear deterrent’ to describe the more capable posture required to make nuclear deterrence effective in a missile defense environment.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">130 </span><span class="underline0">In conceiving of warfighting with nuclear assets, a principal impediment for the PLA would be a strict adherence to its oft-repeated pledge not to use nuclear weapons first at any time, under any circumstances, and not to use nuclear weapons on non-nuclear nations and regions.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">131 </span><span class="underline0">However</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline0">not only are certain exceptions to this pledge made from time to time in unofficial remarks, but there is currently an intellectual debate in China as to the damage a policy of NFU inflicts on the credibility and effectiveness of deterrence.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Some </span><span class="underline0">strategists appear to view the NFU policy as an unnecessary self-imposed strategic constraint: 'China should learn how to maintain necessary flexibility without being fettered by responsibilities and obligations at the level of strategic deterrence.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">'132 Certainly, </span><span class="underline0">the debate within China on 'no first use' is real, with the later generation of officers, diplomats, and scholars leaning significantly farther forward toward </span><span class="boldunderline">modifying or jettisoning such a declaratory policy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.133 </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Now the NTI Global Security Newswire has a potentially most significant small report on the matter...</span><span class="underline0">The United States' expanding missile defense activities might lead China to boost its nuclear arsenal,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a former senior Russian military official said yesterday. &quot;</span><span class="underline0">At present, China has a very limited nuclear potential, but my recent contacts with Chinese military representatives indicate that if the United States deploys a global missile defense system, in</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> particular in </span><span class="underline0">the Far East, China will build up its offensive capability,&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> said former Russian Defense Ministry deputy chief Lt.

A number of comments by Chinese strategic analysts</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, cited by China Daily, </span><span class="underline0">caught my eye </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">...</span><span class="underline0">Washington appears determined to surround China with US-built anti-missile systems, military scholars have observed.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> According to US-based Defense News, </span><span class="underline0">Taiwan became the fifth global buyer of the Patriot missile defense system last year following Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Germany. Quite a few military experts have noted that Washington's latest proposed weapon deal with Taiwan is the key part of a US strategic encirclement of China in the East Asian region, and that the missiles could soon have a footprint that extends from Japan to the Republic of Korea and Taiwan. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Air force colonel Dai Xu, a renowned military strategist, wrote in an article released this month that </span><span class="underline0">&quot;China is in a crescent-shaped ring of encirclement.

The headline of the NTI GSN report is; &quot;China Might Boost Nuclear Deterrent, Russian Expert Says&quot;. We must be careful to keep the above distinction in mind. Boosting nuclear deterrence implies moving a step beyond minimum deterrence, but that does not necessarily follow. China's angry response to the Taiwan arms deal, which included a PAC3 deal, should be seen in this wider context. </span><span class="underline0">Now Patriots and the like are not the same as the other more strategic components of BMD. But these comments from the China Daily report are worth citing </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">...Tang </span><span class="underline0">Xiaosong</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, director </span><span class="underline0">of</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the Center of International Security and Strategy Studies with </span><span class="underline0">Guangdong University</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of Foreign Studies </span><span class="underline0">noted that the ring encircling China can also be expanded at any time in other directions.

Tang </span><span class="underline0">Xiaosong </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">makes a very important point.

He is right of course. Notice that under the framework of &quot;dissuasion&quot; Beijing should now be dissuaded from investing in further enhancing its MRBM and SRBM potential. Somehow I doubt whether this will come to pass. The thing to worry about here is that </span><span class="underline0">any US boost,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> both </span><span class="underline0">to the qualitative capacity of its offensive and defensive strategic potential</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, I think </span><span class="underline0">is </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">not necessarily qualitative Chinese modernisation or even a boost in its deterrence construct, but rather </span><span class="underline0">a shift towards a strategic posture consistent with Launch on Warning.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The interesting link here is growing Chinese space capability. </span><span class="underline0">As Beijing develops a mature space program this will give PLA strategic planners the option of creating a space based early warning system, enabling the adoption of something akin to Launch on Warning. That would be bad for strategic stability, and would have the affect of decreasing US national security.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Notice that this is the opposite of </span><span class="underline0">the pronounced objective of Ballistic Missile Defence. </span><br />

<strong>Removing BMD is a pre-requisite to the CP functioning- BMD leads to false sense of security – makes nuclear first strikes extremely likely</strong><br />
<strong>Chase 10</strong> [Michael, Associate Research Professor and Director of the Mahan Scholars Program at the United States Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. His current research focuses on strategic deterrence and nuclear weapons policy issues, “The U.S.-China Strategic Security Relationship and the Nuclear Posture Review Report” ]<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Recently, some Chinese scholars have expressed concerns that </span><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">even if U.S. missile defense and conventional global strike systems have little or no real impact on China’s assured second strike capability</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>they may still give U.S. planners and decision-makers a false sense of superiority, potentially leading to U.S. attempts to coerce China with nuclear threats in a crisis</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, according to Li Bin and Nie Hongyi, “</span><u>even though the missile defense system cannot be relied upon in actual warfare it may lead American decision-makers to misjudge by causing them to imagine they already have a more powerful strategic advantage, thus leading them to blindly adopt a nuclear coercion policy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” [7]. Similarly, they raise the possibility that </span><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">even the illusion of “nuclear primacy”</span> could</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">lead to more aggressive behavior on the part of the United States: “some American scholars believe </span><u>the United States can already rely on a preemptive nuclear strike to completely destroy China’s long-range nuclear weapons, and therefore they maintain that the United States already has the capital to carry out nuclear coercion against China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” [8]. The 2010 NPR should help to alleviate some of these concerns. </span><u>The NPR also identifies China as an important partner in pursuit of nonproliferation and arms control goals in the short- and long-term, stating that strategic stability will facilitate pursuit of these broader policy objectives</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[9]. </span><u>Nonproliferation and preventing nuclear terrorism were high on the agenda when Chinese President Hu Jintao arrived at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington last week, but the time is not yet ripe for arms control talks with China, especially given Beijing’s unwillingness to engage in the process at least until U.S. and Russian forces reach lower levels</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. According to Hui Zhang, “Given the huge qualitative and quantitative gap between the Chinese arsenal and those of the United States and Russia, however, </span><u>Beijing cannot be expected to involve itself directly in the reduction of its nuclear weapons until the United States and Russia have made deeper cuts in their arsenals</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” [10]. Yet China’s integration into the global nuclear reduction process that President Obama outlined in his 2009 Prague speech will eventually be required to move toward the long-term goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. The NPR reflects this challenge, stating, “over time” the United States “will also engage with other nuclear weapon states, including China, on ways to expand the nuclear reduction process in the future” [11]. </span><u>It is unclear at what point China would be prepared to engage in this process. As Hui notes, “Beijing does not yet appear to have worked out a detailed set of preconditions, including a specific number that the United States and Russia must cut, before it joins the process</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” [12]. All of these challenges underscore the importance of strategic dialogue between the United States and China to enhance strategic stability and promote cooperation on non-proliferation and arms control issues. </span><br />

<u>In addition, the US Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system also makes it easier for the United States to use nuclear weapons first.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In 2001, </span><u>as a prelude to deploying the BMD system, Washington backed out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. This ironically reminded us of President Richard Nixon’s words in 1972.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> When justifying the need to sign the ABM treaty, Nixon said that “If you have a shield, it is easier to use the sword.” 13 Back </span><u>then, in order to secure “mutually assured destruction” and establish a “balance of terror,” the Soviet Union and the United States agreed to refrain from building a “shield” so that neither side could easily “use the sword</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” Today, </span><u>with the gradual shaping of the American shield, offensive action is far easier. The rationale is simple. If the United States does not have foolproof confidence to erase the adversary’s nuclear arsenal in a first strike, it will have to deliberate on the possibility of a counterattack</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, s</span><u>hould the United States possess the strategic defense capabilities, its first strike would leave only a few nuclear weapons available for the adversary to launch a retaliatory counterattack, which would be within the capacity of its missile defense system to intercept; a second strike would then eliminate the remainder of the adversary’s nuclear force.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is apparent that, with the BMD system, </span><u>US decision-makers would be greatly emboldened when facing the choice of launching a pre-emptive or even preventative nuclear attack.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Therefore, for states that possess large numbers of tactical nuclear weapons and have established nuclear doctrines and postures tailored for first use of nuclear weapons, the cost invested may be highly prohibitive to considering alternative policies. </span><u>A credible NFU pledge would require such states to make substantial changes to their first-use oriented arsenals, delegation of authority and force deployment. As a domestic player, the military-industrial complex involved in the development and production of nuclear weapons would be opposed to any decline in the role of nuclear weapons in national security strategy and would form an obstacle to NFU policy. Although an NFU treaty is the hope of peace-loving people worldwide, no country would be willing to sacrifice its core security interests for moral high ground</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. At a time when most of the nuclear weapons states are pursuing first-use nuclear policies, t</span><u>he effectiveness of a unilateral NFU policy in safeguarding the state security is under increasing doubt. The gap between the need of safeguarding a credible level of state security and the reliable retaliatory capability of NFU policy is growing. For an NFU policy to take effect, a credible second-strike capability is a key condition.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This means a state must have enough nuclear assets left to stage an effective retaliation after an adversary’s first-use attack, discouraging impulsive, pre-emptive acts by its enemies. </span><br />

There has already been notable progress toward this goal – more than many observers might have thought possible just a few years ago. </span><u>However, further progress <span style="background-color: yellow;">is by no means assured</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>All of the activities listed above <span style="background-color: yellow;">will require</span> continued policy vision as well as <span style="background-color: yellow;">effective</span> program <span style="background-color: yellow;">management to work through</span> ever-present <span style="background-color: yellow;">budgetary</span>, bureaucratic, <span style="background-color: yellow;">and</span>perhaps <span style="background-color: yellow;">political obstacles</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 2.

Two aspects of the Bush Administration’s new BMD strategy could have significant implications for future Japanese missile defense cooperation. ABM Treaty</span><u>. One aspect is the fact that <span style="background-color: yellow;">a sea-based system</span> designed to attack ICBMs <span style="background-color: yellow;">violates the</span> 1972 <span style="background-color: yellow;">ABM Treaty</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – a reality graphically acknowledged by the Bush Administration’s decision to exercise the U.S. right to withdraw from the treaty. </span><u>J<span style="background-color: yellow;">apan</span> was not a party to <span style="background-color: yellow;">t</span>he <span style="background-color: yellow;">t</span>reaty but <span style="background-color: yellow;">has regarded the agreement as a</span> fundamental <span style="background-color: yellow;">pillar of nuclear stability</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The abandonment of the treaty by the United States troubled Japan, but – ironically – also removed one barrier to participation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ban on Collective Defense. </span><u>Second, <span style="background-color: yellow;">any use of Japanese technology</span> for an American NMD system <span style="background-color: yellow;">would violate both Japan’s post-World War II</span> anti-nuclear <span style="background-color: yellow;">policy, which forbids participation in U.S. nuclear strategy</span>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">and</span> a long-standing legal <span style="background-color: yellow;">interpretation that Article 9</span> of the Japanese constitution <span style="background-color: yellow;">forbids participation in collective self-defense</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Under this interpretation, formulated by the Cabinet Affairs Legal Office in 1981, it is acknowledged that Japan has such a right under international law, </span><u>but cannot exercise it because the constitution provides that the exercise of the right of self-defense must be limited to the minimum level necessary to defend Japanese territory</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is deemed constitutional under this interpretation because Japan’s responsibilities relate only to the defense of Japan itself. Japan is not obligated under the U.S.-Japan Defense Treaty to participate in the defense of the United States or U.S. forces, let alone participate in security cooperation involving third countries.34 </span><u>Thus, under present and foreseeable circumstances, <span style="background-color: yellow;">only a system that is designed for the defense</span> of Japanese territory and is not in violation of the ABM Treaty <span style="background-color: yellow;">would appear to be able to pass political and constitutional muster</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Japanese <span style="background-color: yellow;">officials,</span> political <span style="background-color: yellow;">leaders, and opinion makers have</span> universally <span style="background-color: yellow;">expressed concern about</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">new U.S. approach</span> to missile defense</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. During a visit to Japan in early May 2001 to brief Japanese leaders on the Bush Administration’s new policy,Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage reportedly received an ambiguous response. </span><u>Japanese leaders expressed their “understanding” of the U.S. position</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – a classic Japanese formulation for avoiding assent. Japanese </span><u>officials appeared to agree with the view of Japanese defense analysts who complained that supporting the U.S. initiative would link Japan to U.S. global nuclear strategy in a way that was incompatible with Japan’s non-nuclear principles</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.35 For the time being, the Japanese government has indicated that the new Bush Administration strategy will not affect joint research and development activities on the NTW interceptor, and also that Japan’s stance may be more relaxed than originally suggested. In a May 9, 2001 press article, a senior official of the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) reportedly explained, “We can understand U.S. thinking about regarding NMD and TMD as a comprehensive package, but our position will not change: we will only carry on joint research on the TMD.” The same article expressed the Japanese government’s position that Japan could give no more than “moral support” by expressing “understanding” of the U.S. NMD program, since it was for the purpose of defending the United States and not Japan.36 The Director General of the Japan Defense Agency (JDA), told reporters on May 11 that “The United States has just completed producing a blueprint, and it is too early to assess it at this point.” Reportedly, however, a senior official of the JDA judged that regardless of the decision of the Bush Administration not to distinguish between NMD and TMD, it was a “fact” that there was “a clear difference in technologies between long- and short- range missiles.” In any event, the official said, Japan’s research cooperation would continue.37 </span></span><br />

In turn, </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan’s alliance</span> dilemmas vis-à-vis the US generated by BMD<span style="background-color: yellow;">,</span> a<span style="background-color: yellow;">re</span> themselves <span style="background-color: yellow;">compounded by BMD’s generation of security dilemmas</span> in East A</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">sia which force ever greater reliance on the US-Japan alliance. </span><u>Japan’s existing security dilemma vis-à-vis North Korea is well known</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Japan’s participation in BMD</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, although not likely to stimulate the North’s already on-going missile programme which is so vital to its diplomatic and military campaign to break out of its international isolation, is also unlikely to curb the North’s build-up of its missile forces, and this is despite opinions which see BMD as a means to convince the North of the futility of threatening Japan and the US. </span><u>Instead, the principal security dilemma that BMD <span style="background-color: yellow;">i</span>s likely to exacerbate for Japan is that visàvis China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Chinese policy-makers are concerned that Japan’s development of a BMD 25 system developed in conjunction with the US could lead to the negation of its nuclear deterrent by providing Japan with both a ‘spear’ and ‘shield’. </span><u>The spear of the US extended nuclear deterrent would be complemented by a BMD shield, allowing Japan deterrence by both punishment and denial vis-à-vis China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Chinese fears might in part be justified as the Aegis BMD system may have some residual or ‘break out’ capabilities to defend against its inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMS), and certainly the US regards the Aegis/SMD component of its missile defence as part of a defensive shield against ICBMs.25 China in all likelihood though could overcome the negation of its strategic nuclear arsenal through the employment of countermeasures and development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV) to overwhelm any BMD system. China’s concerns extend also to the Japan’s possible countering of its tactical ballistic missiles and involvement in the Taiwan issue. China’s worst case scenario would be Japan’s deployment either individually or in conjunction with the US of its sea-mobile NTWD system to defend Taiwan in a future crisis situation. In particular, China would fear the formation of a quasi-alliance amongst the US, Japan and Taiwan. For if the US were to sell AWS and BMD technology to Taiwan, this could result in all three powers being equipped with fully interoperable equipment, so smoothing the way for three-way military cooperation. </span><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan’s reluctance to</span> become <span style="background-color: yellow;">embroiled directly in</span> a Taiwan Straits crisis makes this an unlikely scenario except in circumstances of a full scale conflict. Far more likely is that Japan would utilise its BMD system to defend US forces operating in a Taiwan Straits crisis from bases in Japan; an action that would complicate any attempts by China to intimidate US forces in the region short of initiating a war also against Japan</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. China can ultimately overcome any BMD system through increasing production of its missiles; a process that is relatively cheap and likely to saturate and overcome any defence. </span><u>Therefore, <span style="background-color: yellow;">Japan’s interest in BMD</span>, although not initiating the process, <span style="background-color: yellow;">carries the risk of</span>accelerating <span style="background-color: yellow;">China’</span>s u<span style="background-color: yellow;">pgrading</span> of <span style="background-color: yellow;">its nuclear</span> and conventional ballistic missile c<span style="background-color: yellow;">apabilities</span> and generating further momentum for a regional arms race. Japan’s <span style="background-color: yellow;">participation in BMD</span>, although adding a degree of defensive capability, at the same time looks <span style="background-color: yellow;">set to complicate its security dilemmas</span> with North Korea and especially China, and emphasises for Japanese policy-makers the <span style="background-color: yellow;">extreme caution</span> needed <span style="background-color: yellow;">in</span> managing the project and <span style="background-color: yellow;">entrapment risks with the US</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">However, BMD by the very nature of the 26 technological and political-military decisions that it imposes on Japan undercuts hedging options to manage these risks. </span><u>Firstly, Japan’s ability to evade and temporise is a limited option under participation in BMD. Japan during the uncertainties of the Clinton administration certainly practiced a type of wait and see option before committing itself to any specific project or architecture that might mean it entering into BMD on terms that overly strategically disadvantaged it against the US.</u> </span><br />

US-Japan BMD fuels Asian arms race, incentivizes Sino-Russo military counterbalancing, and increases North Korea’s nuclearization<br />

(Cheong, 12/24, Ohmynews Staff, Founder and Representative of Civil Network for a Peaceful Korea(CNPK), a non-government organization, “Missile Defense Acts as a Trojan Horse” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:7935:http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?at_code=432927 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?at_code=432927" rel="nofollow">http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?at_code=432927</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:7935 -->)<br />
In this regard, <span class="underline">the Missile Defense is acting as a &quot;Trojan horse</span>&quot; <span class="underline">to disrupt Japan's pacifist constitution</span>. The <span class="underline">ban on collective defense</span>, the <span class="underline">Three Principles on Arms Exports</span>, <span class="underline">and the administration's control over the military have been restraining Japan from becoming a military superpower</span> and turning to the right. However, <span class="underline">the US-Japan Missile Defense</span> ties <span class="underline">will neutralize all three means</span>. It is widely known that the hard-liners in the two countries have justified such a move on the grounds of the &quot;North Korea Threat&quot; and the &quot;China Threat.&quot; <span class="underline">Missile Defense Fuels Already Heated Arms Race in Northeast Asia</span> What is of more concern is that the development of the <span class="underline"><strong>US-Japan Missile Defense system is fueling an arms race in northeast Asia</strong></span>. The military budget of the US, Japan, China, Russia and the two Koreas together accounts for 70 percent of the global total. These nations, which happen to be the participants of the six-party talks, are heavily concentrating with their own military buildup. One of the primary concerns in this situation at the moment is the possible negative impact on resolving North Korea's nuclear issues. Pyongyang may begin to harbor misgivings about the intention of Washington and Tokyo, which are rushing to establish the Missile Defense system amid continuing progress in resolving its nuclear problem. The two <span class="underline">allies' military alliance</span> only <span class="underline"><strong>makes it harder</strong> for Kim Jong-il's regime to abandon its nuclear ambition for strategic reasons</span>. The responses of <span class="underline">China and Russia</span> are also very important. They <span class="underline">have perceived the Missile Defense cooperation as a way to enhance the two partners' military hegemonism</span>. <span class="underline">Russia has been engaging in a</span> Second <span class="underline">Cold War-like controversy</span> with the US over building a Missile Defense base in Eastern Europe, <span class="underline">and publicly opposed Japan's involvement in the US Missile Defense plans</span>. In October, <span class="underline">Russia criticized the two nations' military alliance saying that the Missile Defense system's goal is to sharpen their military competitive edge and that Russia strongly opposes US-Japan defense ties</span>. Given that such a strong response from the Kremlin was unusual, <span class="underline">Moscow </span><span class="Box">is highly likely</span> to seek <span class="underline">to counter the US-led Missile Defense system by strengthening its military cooperation with neighboring China and its military strength in northeast Asia</span>, if Washington and Tokyo continue to ignore its opposition. <span class="underline">China, which has been viewing the Missile Defense alliance between the two nations as the biggest threat in the 21st century</span>, also will not sit idle if they push ahead with their Missile Defense plan. <span class="underline">Up until now, China has been hesitant</span> to make any diplomatic response, <span class="underline">out of concern that</span> a <span class="underline">public opposition</span> to the Missile Defense <span class="underline">may cause a </span><span class="Box">diplomatic row</span> and spread the &quot;China Threat&quot; concept around the world. <span class="underline">At the same time</span>, however, <span class="underline">Beijing has been continuously strengthening its military power to neutralize the Missile Defense system</span>; in January 2007, it performed a successful anti-satellite weapons test. China is especially concerned about the sea-based Missile Defense program. The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense is a mobile and transportable system, and therefore is deployable in the Taiwan Strait. In February 2005, the US and Japan agreed to include the Taiwan Strait issues in their &quot;common strategic objectives,&quot; which allowed them to deploy armed forces in the area if necessary. The Need to Disarm the Six Parties It is often said that <span class="underline">Pyongyang's nuclear issue is the biggest risk factor for northeast Asia's security</span>, and the six-party talks came amid such concerns. However, the five other members of the talks are vocal only about North Korea's denuclearization, while remaining silence about their own military buildup. The six nations have also pledged to expand the talks into an arena for establishing a peace regime in northeast Asia. Contrary to their political rhetoric on peace and security in the region, however, <span class="underline">they have been competing with one another in the areas of military buildup and stronger military alliances</span>. <span class="underline">The Missile Defense plan is </span><span class="Box">at the center</span><span class="underline"> <strong>of their mutual distrust and consequent arms buildup</strong></span>. In conclusion, <span class="underline">the best way to realize permanent peace</span> in northeast Asia <span class="underline">is to make every effort to stop the arms race rather than fuel it</span>. It is high time that the members of the six-party talks start discussions on all of the six nations' disarmament.<br />

Russia-China military alliance kills U.S. heg and causes war<br />
<span class="cite">Blank 9</span> – Dr. Stephen Blank , Research Professor of National Security Affairs at the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College, March 2009, “Russia And Arms Control: Are There Opportunities For The Obama Administration?,” online: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:7936:http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:7936 --><br />
Consequently, <span class="UnderlineChar">the danger is</span> that this ideological-strategic rivalry will harden, leading to a polarized, bilateral, and <span class="UnderlineChar">hostile division of Asia into blocs based on a Sino-Russian bloc confronting a U.S. alliance system</span> led by alliances with Japan, South Korea, and Australia. Some Western writers have already opined that Sino- Russian relations appear to be tending towards an anti- American alliance in both Northeast and Central Asia.235 But more recently both Asian and Western writers have begun to argue that such a polarization in Asia could be taking shape. The shared interest of perceiving America as an ideological and geopolitical threat has also united Moscow and Beijing in a common cause.236 Already in the 1990s, prominent analysts of world politics like Richard Betts and Robert Jervis, and then subsequent Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) studies, postulated that <span class="UnderlineChar">the</span> <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">greatest security threat</span> <span class="UnderlineChar">to American interests would be a Russian-Chinese alliance</span>.237 Arguably, that is happening now and occurs under conditions of the energy crisis that magnifies Russia’s importance to China beyond providing diplomatic support, cover for China’s strategic rear, and arms sales.238 <span class="UnderlineChar">That alliance would encompass</span> the following points of friction with Washington: <span class="UnderlineChar">strategic resistance to U.S. interests in Central and Northeast Asia, resistance to antiproliferation and pressures upon</span> the regimes in <span class="UnderlineChar">Iran and North Korea</span>, <span class="UnderlineChar">an energy alliance</span>, <span class="UnderlineChar">an ideological counteroffensive against U.S. support for democratization abroad, and the rearming of both Russia and China</span>, if not their proxies and allies, <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">with a view towards conflict with America</span>.239 One South Korean columnist, Kim Yo’ng Hu’i, wrote in 2005 that, China and Russia are reviving their past strategic partnership to face their strongest rival, the United States. A structure of strategic competition and confrontation between the United States and India on the one side, and Russia and China on the other is unfolding in the eastern half of the Eurasian continent including the Korean peninsula. <span class="UnderlineChar">Such a situation will</span> definitely <span class="UnderlineChar">bring a</span> <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">huge wave of shock to the Korean peninsula</span>, directly dealing with the strategic flexibility of U.S. forces in Korea. If China and Russia train their military forces together in the sea off the coast of China’s Liaodong Peninsula, it will also have an effect on the 21st century strategic plan of Korea. We will now need to think of Northeast Asia on a much broader scale. The eastern half of Eurasia, including Central Asia, has to be included in our strategic plan for the future.240 Since then, Lyle Goldstein and Vitaly Kozyrev have similarly written that. If the Kremlin favors Beijing, <span class="UnderlineChar">the resulting Sino-Russian energy nexus</span>—joining the world’s fastest growing energy consumer with one of the world’s fastest growing producers—<span class="UnderlineChar">would support China’s growing claim to regional preeminence</span>. From Beijing’s point of view, this relationship would promise a relatively secure and stable foundation for one of history’s most extraordinary economic transformations. At stake are energy reserves in eastern Russia that far exceed those in the entire Caspian basin. Moreover, according to Chinese strategists, robust Sino-Russian energy links would decrease the vulnerability of Beijing’s sea lines of communication to forms of “external pressure” in case of a crisis concerning Taiwan or the South China Sea. From the standpoint of global politics, the formation of the Sino-Russian energy nexus would represent a strong consolidation of an emergent bipolar structure in East Asia, with one pole led by China (and including Russia) and one led by the United States (and including Japan).241<br />
<span class="UnderlineChar">Russia’s tie to China</span> certainly expresses a deep strategic identity or congruence of interests on a host of issues from Korea to Central Asia and <span class="UnderlineChar">could have</span> <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">significant military implications.</span> Those implications are not just due to Russian arms sales to China, <span class="UnderlineChar">which are</span> <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">clearly tied to an anti-American military scenario,</span> most probably connected with Taiwan. They also include the possibility of joint military action in response to a regime crisis in the DPRK.242<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Meanwhile, </span><span class="underline">U.S. plans to build a missile defense system in Central and Eastern Europe may cause Russia to withdraw from the INF Treaty and resume programs for producing intermediate-range missiles. Washington may respond by deploying similar missiles in Europe, which would dramatically increase the vulnerability of Russia’s strategic forces and their control and warning systems<strong>. <span style="background-color: aqua;">This could make the stage for nuclear confrontation even tenser</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

First, the assumption is that the private sector can be cheaper than internalized military provision for a range of deployed support functions. Under pinning this are neo-classical assumptions that competitive tendering between firms will drive down cost, private sector comparative advantage can be exploited, and that there is scope for long-term and mutually beneficial relational contracts with private firms. Second, the assumption is that cost savings and easing of the burdens on military manpower release financial resources for defense &quot;modernization&quot; in other areas and trained military expertise to ease &quot;overstretch.&quot;<br />

Much of the foreign policy discussion in the United States today is focused upon the dilemma posed by the Iraq War and the threat posed by Islamist terrorism. These problems are, of course, both immediate and important. However, America also faces other challenges to its physical security and economic prosperity, and these are more long-term and probably more profound. There is, first, the threat posed by our declining competitiveness in the global economy, a threat most obviously represented by such rising economic powers as China and India.1 There is, second, the threat posed by our increasing dependence on oil imports from the Middle East. Moreover, these two threats are increasingly connected, as China and India themselves are greatly increasing their demand for Middle East oil.2 The United States of course faced great challenges to its security and economy in the past, most obviously from Germany and Japan in the first half of the twentieth century and from the Soviet Union in the second half. Crucial to America's ability to prevail over these past challenges was our technological and industrial leadership, and especially our ability to continuously recreate it. Indeed, the United States has been unique among great powers in its ability to keep on creating and recreating new technologies and new industries, generation after generation. Perpetual innovation and technological leadership might even be said to be the American way of maintaining primacy in world affairs. They are almost certainly what America will have to pursue in order to prevail over the contemporary challenges involving economic competitiveness and energy dependence. There is therefore an urgent need for America to resume its historic emphasis on innovation. The United States needs a national strategy focused upon developing new technologies and creating new industries. Every successful strategy must define an objective or mission, determine a solution, and assemble the means of execution. In this case, the objective is economic superiority; the solution is new industries which build upon the contemporary revolution in information technology; and the means of execution will have to include a partnership of industry, government, and people.3<br />

But, given the downsizing the U.S. armed forces had undergone since the fall of the Berlin Wall the military turned to the private sector for help. My 0wn view of the world is that the international order will continue to be roiled and disrupted for some time to come. Thus, there will be a void in international politics. And, just as in nature, which abhors a vacuum, private contractors will step in to fill it. Personally, I think the outsourcing of military capabilities left the station decades ago. It has taken this long for public perception to catch up-and people still only see the caboose. If people don't want to use private contractors, the choices are simple. Either scale back U.S. geopolitical commitments or enlarge the military, something that will entail more gargantuan expenditures and even, some argue, a return to the draft down the road. Personally, I prefer the former. But most people prefer substituting contractors for draftees. As former Marine colonel Jack Holly said, “We're never going to war without the private security industry again in a non-draft environ ment.&quot;7 Still, what I would really like to see is a national debate on this. Instead, we bury our heads in the sand and bemoan the presence of private contractors. That is a waste of time. Private security contractors, after all, are just doing the job we outsourced to them. And, like them or hate them, they are going to be around for a long time. As Paul Lombardi , CEO of DynCorp, said in 2003, &quot;You could fight without us, but it would be difficult. Because we're so involved, it's difficult to extricate us from the process .&quot;~ And as Professor Debra Avant noted, &quot;A lot of the companies in the 1990s were small, service-based companies. Now they 're small services-based wings of large companies. Defense contractors have been buying up these companies like mad. This is where they think the future is:&quot;<br />

<strong>Heg solves every scenario for nuclear war</strong><br />

Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as “No. 1” and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying — its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not only on the goodwill of peoples but also on American power. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe’s stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world’s great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe — if it adopted what some call a strategy of “offshore balancing” — this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, “offshore” role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel ’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn’t changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.<br />

Contracting for foreign training has thus far changed the balance of control between the executive and legislative branches of government. The executive branch hires contractors, not Congress. Though Congress approves the military budget, it does not approve individual decisions to contract out training. It is harder for Congress to oversee PSC behavior in contract with the US government. The annual consolidated report on military assistance and sales, for instance, does not include information on who is conducting particular training missions.Examples of executive use of PSCs to evade congressional restrictions abound. For instance, when Congress institutes stipulations on the numbers of US troops – the executive has used contractors to go above this number. Sometimes Congress has innovated and stipulated an upper limit on the number of contractors, but this has simply led PSCs to hire more local personnel. Thus, the executive branch, in its decisions to hire contractors and in its day-to-day implementation of policy is advantaged vis-a-vis Congress. Indeed, this change is often touted by members of the executive branch as one of the benefits of contracting out. This is not to suggest that congressional oversight of foreign training is easy or that the executive does not have an advantage in this arena in the first place. The institutional safeguards that give Congress indirect means of control over military forces, however, are not present with PSCs. For instance, Congress has long-standing ties to military organizations, which affect incentives for individual service members and provide mechanisms for congressional control. These mechanisms are not so readily available for PSCs. There are, of course, other ways to avoid congressional scrutiny – through the use of covert operations, for instance. PSCs simply add another tool to this list. This is also not to suggest that Congress will not develop better tools for oversight of PSCs in the future. Given the stresses on US forces and the likelihood that contractors will be used for a wide variety of military tasks in the future, I hope that Congress along with the agencies of the executive branch will develop more effective strategies for managing these contracts.<br />

<strong>Here’s a solvency advocate – removing PMCs doesn’t matter</strong><br />
<strong>Bayley</strong> (David, a distinguished professor in the School of Criminal Justice at the State University of<br />
New York at Albany. “Democratizing the Police Abroad: What to Do and How to Do It”) MFR<br />
1. As with any program of planned change, American foreign assistance to police development and reform abroad should be guided by clearly articulated and factually informed theory connecting it and desired outcomes. It has become commonplace in writing about foreign assistance to say that the United States frequently undertakes programs because they are laudable rather than sensible. Desirability overshadows feasibility. Moreover, the United States relies on a few overworked reform tactics, such as drop-in courses and short visits by foreign nationals to the United States, without any evidence that they make a difference. Corollary: The U.S. Government should develop the capacity to plan and implement institutional change in police policy and practice abroad. The key word here is “institutional.” Programs that might contribute to the democratic reform of foreign police are scattered across many agencies. None of them has impressive in-house capability to do this job. The U.S. Department of State’s expertise in this area is concentrated in International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), whose mission is international crime-control and crime-prevention capacitybuilding, not reform. The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), haunted by memories of the discredited Office of Public Safety, is beginning to explore the connections between democracy assistance and criminal justice, but cautiously. The U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ’s) assistance to police is led by law enforcement agencies—the FBI and the DEA. They have substantial foreign experience, but their mission is not democratic reform. ICITAP has the right mission, but it is an orphan dangling between State, AID, and DOJ, without the staff to do the planning required. The U.S. Department of Defense would rather not be involved, but is beginning to recognize that it will be. Altogether, the U.S. Government administers programs for democratic police reform by sleight-of-hand. The fault is not the intelligence or motivation of the people K Issues in International Crime 68 involved. The people in these agencies are smart and knowledgeable. The problem is the system—in particular, the bureaucratic assignment of missions. 2. Programs designed to contribute to the reform of foreign police forces must be based on a thorough understanding of host-country history and practices in policing. Information about foreign police systems, and criminal justice more largely, is not readily available across agencies in Washington. Planning for assistance programs often lacks relevant intelligence. Corollary: Because the design and implementation of reform programs requires hands-on knowledge of operational practices and traditions, the U.S. government should rely less on consultants sent abroad for short periods and more on people assigned to live in country for periods of a year or more. Not only does this lower the costs of administration, but resident managers have greater standing with locals and can make more informed midcourse corrections. 3. Because police reform anywhere is a long-term proposition, American assistance programs should be planned and funded for multiyear periods. Corollary: Assistance to foreign police undertaken during peacekeeping operations should not be tied to military exit timetables. A compelling moral argument can also be made, as we saw in chapter 5, that the military should not withdraw at all until an effective police force has been built. This would suggest that military time schedules should be tied to civilian ones rather than vice versa. 4. In providing assistance to police forces abroad, a mechanism needs to be created within the U.S. government to assess the programmatic balance between law enforcement capacity building and democratic reform in particular countries. PDD-71 suggested this sort of collaborative assessment in directing the U.S. Department of State to “build partnerships between Justice and USAID that enables the USG to help establish judicial and penal systems during peace operations that then become sustainable institutions.”1 Such partnership is needed for programs of foreign police assistance generally, not just those associated with peace operations. Democratizing the Police Abroad: What to Do and How to Do It 69 Corollary: All programs of assistance to foreign police should be reviewed for their likely effects on the trajectory of local political development. Some mechanisms to this purpose are already in place: for example, the Law Enforcement Working Groups that meet monthly at the Department of State, country teams in embassies abroad that draft yearly mission performance plans, and the Interagency Working Group on Democracy under the leadership of the Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Given the generality of concern about the ad hoc nature of U.S. planning for police assistance, however, something more would appear to be necessary. 5. The implementation of reform assistance to foreign police needs to be more carefully coordinated among agencies within the U.S. Government, not only to avoid working at cross-purposes, but to avoid duplication, simplify contact between host governments and the U.S. Government, and enhance oversight.2 Although there is universal agreement among observers about the importance of interagency coordination, there is sharp disagreement about how to do it, in particular, about whether responsibility should be located in a single agency or remain shared among several agencies. 6. The United States should coordinate its programs of democratic reform in particular countries with other donors, both public and private, during the planning as well as the implementation stage. Designing programs in isolation from other international actors guarantees wasted effort and resources. It also confuses host governments about what should be done. 7. Programs of democratic police assistance must include measures for building support for reform among political leaders as well as society at large. 8. The U.S. military should not assume police responsibilities as part of peacekeeping operations except for short periods of time in transitional situations. Corollary: Because the U.S. military will occasionally participate in civilian policing, it should standardize its training in this regard across the services. 9. The design and implementation of democratic police development programs should be done largely by police and civilians experienced with State and local policing in the United States. The Federal Government is responsible for foreign policy and therefore for America’s police assistance abroad, but it has limited police resources and expertise of its own to deploy in support of that policy. Federal agencies such as the FBI and the DEA are not full-service police forces responsive to calls for assistance from the public. They specialize in criminal investigation and selective law enforcement at the direction of Congress and the administration of the day. Although Federal personnel are as democratic in their normative orientation as State and local police officers, their mission equips them more for assisting the development of overseas law enforcement capacity than in the design and reform of civilian public-service policing. The challenge for the Federal Government, then, is to find ways to mobilize the immense fund of knowledge and experience residing in State and local police forces. 10. Programs of assistance to foreign police should be conducted in full public view and subject to systematic congressional oversight. At the moment, assistance to foreign police is provided through a series of exemptions to section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act. There is no “positive institutional mandate” with respect to police assistance.3 As a result, there is no coordinated congressional supervision. Corollary: Foreign assistance to police should rarely be provided clandestinely, and then only under carefully monitored conditions. 11. The United States should develop a CIVPOL reserve that can be mobilized quickly for deployment abroad. This has been called for by PDD-71, although the statutory basis for doing so has not been developed.4<br />

<br />
I might have missed it, but at today's White House press conference I don't think anyone asked the president about yesterday's important court ruling enshrining Bush-era claims to sweeping executive power, powers that the Obama Justice Department has sought to protect. As the New York Times complained yesterday, &quot;Barack Obama told voters in 2008 that he opposed the government cult of secrecy, but once he became president, his Justice Department also argued that the case should be dismissed on secrecy grounds.&quot; And, pending a likely US Supreme Court decision, he has thus far succeeded. In that vein, check out Washington Times national security correspondent Eli Lake's provocative story today about other lines of continuity between Obama national security policies and those of the administration he condemned nonstop for most of 2007 and 2008: On issues ranging from the government's detention authority to a program to kill al Qaeda terrorist suspects, even if they are American citizens, Mr. Obama has consolidated much of the power President George W. Bush asserted after Sept. 11 in the waging of the U.S. war against terror.... Overall, [former CIA Director Michael] Hayden said, there is more continuity than divergence between the Bush and Obama administrations' approaches to the war on terror. &quot;You've got state secrets, targeted killings, indefinite detention, renditions, the opposition to extending the right of habeas corpus to prisoners at Bagram [in Afghanistan],&quot; Mr. Hayden said, listing the continuities. &quot;And although it is slightly different, Obama has been as aggressive as President Bush in defending prerogatives about who he has to inform in Congress for executive covert action.&quot;<br />

Americans are demanding major changes in the way Washington operates, but while the heat is on Congress, more power than ever resides in the executive agencies. That means making government more accountable will require a redesign of the federal regulatory rulemaking process, which currently serves as a shield that allows laws to be made in an unaccountable and unchecked fashion — out of public view and insulated from voters. This must end. Unfortunately, many actors in the policymaking process — from Congress and the president, to K Street lobbyists and trade associations — prefer that the big decisions be made by bureaucrats in the executive branch. Elected officials do not want to have to stand up before the electorate and answer for the impacts of new regulations. Instead they delegate broad authority to executive agencies and then try to wash their hands of the issue. Blame it on the bureaucrats. One example is the recently enacted health care reform bill. Even the savviest policy wonks cannot tell you exactly what the bill will do because it was really just a massive delegation of authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. According to the Congressional Research Service, the 2,000-page bill has “more than 40 provisions that require, permit or contemplate” promulgating rules, which will impact one-sixth of the nation’s economy without voter input or accountability. Presidents love the rulemaking process because it provides an alternate path for politically unpopular laws. President Obama is moving greenhouse gas regulations through the EPA using the 1970 Clean Air Act; trying to have the FCC regulate the Internet using the 1934 Telecom Act; and installing some version of card check by recess-appointing union lawyer Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board. Cap-and-trade, net neutrality and card check were all disastrous legislative failures, but the rulemaking process provides another avenue for these rejected laws to be pushed on the country. Lobbyists and regulated entities have mastered the rulemaking process and dominate the notice-and-comment period. Agency capture has reached epic proportions, as evidenced by the deplorable relationship between the Minerals Management Service and companies they were supposed to be monitoring. But the current structure provides nary an outlet for a citizen to express outrage and frustration at this kind of inside dealing. None of the agencies will be on the ballot in November.<br />

Marc Ambinder reports on the dictatorial powers held by many in government and upheld yesterday by a judiciary that gives unaccountable power - even the power to torture and kill - a drop-shadow, not a check. Marc has been following this state secrets issue for a long time, sensing, before some others did, that it was the key to Obama's protection of Bush's torturers and his objective disdain for the tortured. Greenwald - another early skeptic - notes that this is not news, however shocking it appears. In 2008, many of us supported Obama in part because he seemed to be a rare candidate who understood the awful potential of government-sanctioned torture to harm us in the war against Jihadism, to eviscerate core American values, and to empower the executive to new and unassailable heights in ways the Founders would have been horrified by. I always knew that Clinton would have little trouble with executive power's reach, and her speech yesterday about the importance and value of American power to direct the planet reveals her comfort with the vast, unwieldy, unaccountable, incredibly expensive apparatus that now pledges to protect us from all evil and solve every global problem - but gives us no way to know how or where or when if it invokes secrecy with this kind of glib facility. Fareed is right about this. Imaginationland lives. And Obama? I see no daylight between him and Clinton any more on this. As Glenn notes, Obama as executive quickly co-opted the kind of blanket secrecy and protection of the national security apparatus from the rule of law that plagued us in the Bush-Cheney administration. Yes, torture ended. That matters a huge amount. He will always deserve credit for that. Of course, I have to trust him on this, since there is precious little way for someone outside the government to test this or know this for sure. But Obama's insistence on protecting every Bush era war criminal and every Bush era war crime from any redress or even scrutiny is a sign both of how cold-blooded he can be, but more, I think, of how powerful the security state now is, how it can protect itself, how it exists independently of any real accountability to anyone, how even the metrics of judging it are beyond the citizen's reach or understanding. I tried valiantly not to believe this of Holder and Obama for months; I tried to see their legitimate concerns about exposing a war machine when it is still at war; I understand the need for some extraordinary renditions; and the necessity for executive power in emergencies to act swiftly, as the Founders intended. Yes war requires some secrecy. But Obama has gone much further than this now. The cloak of secrecy he is invoking is not protecting national security but protecting war crimes. And this is now inescapably his cloak. He is therefore a clear and knowing accessory to war crimes, and should at some point face prosecution as well, if the Geneva Conventions mean anything any more. This won't happen in my lifetime, barring a miracle. Because Obama was a test case. If an outsider like him, if a constitutional scholar like him, at a pivotal moment for accountability like the last two years, cannot hold American torturers to account, there is simply no accountability for American torture. When the CIA actually rehires as a contractor someone who held a power-drill against the skull of a prisoner, you know that change from within this system is impossible. The system is too powerful. It protects itself. It makes a mockery of the rule of law. It doesn't only allow torture; it rewards it. The case yesterday is particularly egregious because it forbade a day in court for torture victims even if only non-classified evidence was used. Think of that for a minute. It shreds any argument that national security is in any way at stake here. It's definitionally not protection of any state secret if all that is relied upon is evidence that is not secret. And so this doctrine has been invoked by Obama not to protect national security but to protect war criminals from the law. There is no other possible interpretation. The Bush executive is therefore now a part of the American system of government, a system that increasingly bears no resemblance to the constitutional limits allegedly placed upon it, and with a judiciary so co-opted by the executive it came up with this ruling yesterday. Obama, more than anyone, now bears responsibility for that. We had a chance to draw a line. We had a chance to do the right thing. But Obama has vigorously denied us the chance even for minimal accountability for war crimes that smell to heaven. And this leviathan moves on, its budget never declining, its reach never lessening, its power now emboldened by the knowledge that this republic will never check it, never inspect it, never hold its miscreants responsible for anything, unless they are wretched scapegoats merely following orders from the unassailable above them. And this means almost certainly that torture will return. The GOP base loves it, as long as it is done against people with dark skin and funny names in places they can look away from. And they know now something they didn't know in 2008. They will always get away with it. Even a liberal Democrat will protect you for ever with a golden shield that creates two classes of people in this country: one above the law - even a law as profound as that against torture - and those outside the government obliged to obey it. This knowledge tells me one thing. If we are to recover as a nation under law rather under a prince, it will not be through the channels of the two major parties or through any president acceptable to the mainstream of either party. It will require a citizenry so enraged and protective of its core liberties against this security Leviathan that it compels dismantling this machinery and exposing it to the light of day - not recklessly, not abruptly, but by close examination, judicial review, press inquiry, protest. There are legitimate trade-offs between national security and liberty. But the protection of war criminals where no secrets are at stake except the scandal of torture itself is not one of them. Alas, there are few such citizens around. And, most tragic of all, those who say they care about liberty above all - the tea-partiers who invoke the founders - seem only too willing to surrender every liberty for the prize of a security against a threat we cannot even measure, and to bow down before a new king (and probably warrior-queen) rather than elect a new president. Have I been radicalized by this? You betcha. Because this is so plainly not a nation under the rule of law anymore. And there are very few political issues more important than that.<br />

<strong>Middle Eastern Conflict won’t escalate</strong><br />

<strong>A. No regional spillover</strong><br />

Finally, there is no precedent for Arab leaders to commit forces to conflicts in which they are not directly involved. The Iraqis and the Saudis did send small contingents to fight the Israelis in 1948 and 1967, but they were either ineffective or never made it. In the 1970s and 1980s, Arab countries other than Syria, which had a compelling interest in establishing its hegemony over Lebanon, never committed forces either to protect the Lebanese from the Israelis or from other Lebanese. The civil war in Lebanon was regarded as someone else's fight. Indeed, this is the way many leaders view the current situation in Iraq. To Cairo, Amman and Riyadh, the situation in Iraq is worrisome, but in the end it is an Iraqi and American fight. As far as Iranian mullahs are concerned, they have long preferred to press their interests through proxies as opposed to direct engagement. At a time when Tehran has access and influence over powerful Shiite militias, a massive cross-border incursion is both unlikely and unnecessary. So Iraqis will remain locked in a sectarian and ethnic struggle that outside powers may abet, but will remain within the borders of Iraq. The Middle East is a region both prone and accustomed to civil wars. But given its experience with ambiguous conflicts, the region has also developed an intuitive ability to contain its civil strife and prevent local conflicts from enveloping the entire Middle East.<br />

<br />
How bad could it get? Very bad.&quot; Yet Dyer concluded by pointing out a number of significantly positive indications: that the terrorists are probably not going to succeed in stampeding the Americans into any truly stupid reaction; that direct physical threat from terrorism was statistically less of a threat than smoking (though over-reaction to terrorism could pose a threat to civil liberties); and that the conflict in the Middle East is likely to stay confined to the region because the connections outward have been dismantled. Most significantly, he explained, the larger trends are promising in that &quot;there are no enemies among the Great Powers. World War III has been cancelled.&quot; The number of democratic countries has doubled in the lifetime of our Pearson College students, and &quot;democratic countries don’t fight wars with each other.&quot; A kind of global culture of values has been emerging. Things are actually changing for the better.<br />

Needless to say, this is nonsense. Israel has fought war after war in the Middle East. Result: no regional conflagration. Iran and Iraq fought one of the bloodiest wars of the second half the 20th century. Result: no regional conflagration. The Soviets fought in Afghanistan and then withdrew. No regional conflagration. The U.S. fought the Gulf War and then left. No regional conflagration. Algeria fought an internal civil war for a decade. No regional conflagration.<br />

<strong>A. Proliferation – Middle eastern instability promotes global nuclear power use</strong><br />

<br />
That leaves the matter of oil. The Middle East produces nearly 31 percent of the world’s oil and consumes only one-fifth of its own output. About two-thirds of the petroleum used in the United States is imported. Perhaps one-fourth of that—around one-sixth of total consumption—comes from the Middle East. Japan imports all its oil, most of from the Middle East. Europe, India, and China all depend, to greater or lesser degrees, on Middle Eastern oil. If something disrupts the flow of almost one-third of the world’s oil, as a major war in the Middle East inevitably would, the cost of energy in the throughout the world will soar. This is a recipe for prolonged recession, and perhaps even depression, in the United States and most of its trading partners. In the short run, healing the American economy would mean accepting measures that many Americans would prefer to avoid. The United States could wind up competing with China for oil in totalitarian states that Washington currently shuns. It also might use its intelligence agencies to promote more favorable policies in Venezuela. Tapping the oil reserves beneath the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve becomes a given in this scenario. To prevent needless environmental damage, drilling would be limited to the winter, when the ground is rock-hard. In addition, the oil would be transported through double-walled pipelines to prevent spills. The pristine Alaskan environment still would suffer, but this concern would no longer prevent drilling. The West Coast also would be opened to drilling, though at distances beyond 20 miles from the beaches, not 10, as the law currently requires. The risk of environmental damage here too would be considered an acceptable price for economic survival. Less controversially, the U.S. surely would buy still more oil from Canada, where a significant new field has recently been discovered, and would develop the deep-water deposits under the Gulf of Mexico much faster than anyone now plans. The United States also needs at least seven new atomic power plants to meet its current and future demand for electricity. An energy crisis finally would break the country’s de facto ban on new reactors, allowing the construction of at least those seven. These first generating stations would use safe hot- water reactors. Even safer technologies lie further in the future, and they are likely to be adopted once they become available. Expanding the use of atomic energy of course means finding somewhere to put still more nuclear waste. This is not a technological problem, so much as a political one. The ideal hiding place for atomic waste was recognized almost as soon as anyone considered the problem. The salt domes of Louisiana have been geologically stable and free of water for hundreds of millions of years; if they had not been, water would long since have washed the salt away. Nuclear waste could safely be stored in one of them until it decayed to the level of background radiation. However, thanks to Louisiana’s political power decades ago, the law forbids consideration of any depository other than the Yucca Mountain site now being developed by the Atomic Energy Agency. In an energy emergency, that law is likely to be rescinded and the country will finally do the obvious. Nuclear waste will be buried in salt domes and forgotten. We can expect a much stronger push for alternative energy as well. Given the proper incentives—and a world oil shortage seems likely to qualify—solar, wind, and other renewable power technologies already have proved useful. Germany, where cloudy days are common, is home to 15 of the world’s largest photovoltaic power plants. The American Southwest would be a much more cost-efficient place to collect solar power. Add in expanded use of wind power where it is most available, perhaps some wave energy on the coasts, and a much stronger effort to develop biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol, and alternative energy stands a good chance of helping out if Middle Eastern oil suddenly becomes unavailable. Yet it will not be available immediately, and it will replace all the energy now coming from the Middle East.<br />

<strong>Expansion of nuclear power is inevitable globally, but the U.S. must take the lead to combat proliferation.</strong><br />
Shaun <strong>Waterman</strong> (UPI Homeland and National Security Editor) 7/8/<strong>2008</strong> “Report urges U.S. to embrace nuclear power growth, despite risks”, UPI<br />
<br />
WASHINGTON, July 8 (UPI) -- A report from a State Department advisory panel says a coming large expansion in global nuclear power generation poses proliferation risks, but the United States must embrace it to ensure that nuclear supplier nations build safeguards into the growing market. The report highlights division among experts about the future of civil nuclear power across the globe, the risks it poses, and the degree to which U.S. policy should support its spread. Some critics of the report say the expansion of nuclear power is not inevitable and should be resisted. A task force of the International Security Advisory Board -- chaired by former Pentagon and World Bank official Paul Wolfowitz -- produced the report, titled &quot;Proliferation Implications of the Global Expansion of Civil Nuclear Power,&quot; in response to a request from Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Robert Joseph. The task force, led by former Reagan and Bush I arms negotiator and government scientist C. Paul Robinson, produced their relatively brief (10 pages, with about twice that in appendices and introductory material) report in just two months earlier this year. A copy was posted recently on the State Department Web site. The report says global demand for power is likely to rise by 100 percent by 2030. &quot;Nuclear energy is likely to be in great demand because of the large price increases for oil and natural gas and the fact that nuclear power produces no carbon (or other) emissions.&quot; Robinson bluntly says the expansion of civil nuclear energy generation is not just inevitable, it is already under way. &quot;You just have to read the newspapers to see that this is the case,&quot; he told United Press International. The report cites a list prepared by the State Department in 2007 of a dozen countries planning to join the nuclear power club, or &quot;giving serious consideration&quot; to it, within the next 10 years -- including the former Soviet Central Asian nations of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan; Islamic giants Indonesia, Egypt and Turkey; and Poland and the Baltic states. Fifteen other nations -- including Algeria, Ghana, Libya, Malaysia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen -- have &quot;longer-term plans or studies under way,&quot; according to the State Department list. While wealthier countries &quot;can try to buy their way out&quot; of the looming energy crunch, &quot;the Third World does not have that option,&quot; and there are few real alternatives to nuclear power for many countries. &quot;There has proved to be no silver bullet in renewable or other alternative energy sources.&quot; The report says there are currently 435 nuclear reactors operating around the world, with 28 new ones currently under construction. It says 222 more are being planned. &quot;It's a pretty depressing prospect,&quot; Robinson concluded. One of the key concerns is the two principal ways of making nuclear fuel -- the enrichment of uranium, for instance, in huge installations of centrifuges; and the reprocessing of spent fuel into plutonium -- can too easily be used to make weapons-grade material for nuclear bombs. So the panel recommends the United States -- in partnership with other countries that already have the capacity to make fuel, the &quot;supplier nations&quot; -- volunteer to &quot;provide reliable, economical supplies of fuel to nations undertaking new or additional nuclear energy plants&quot; with tough safeguards to prevent them developing their own capacities. But critics challenge their premise, saying the idea that the growth of nuclear power generation is inevitable is a canard. Many of those 435 reactors currently operating are due to be retired in the next 20 to 30 years, points out Henry Sokolski, a proliferation expert who worked for Wolfowitz in the Bush I administration and now sits on the congressionally mandated blue-ribbon panel examining the threat of terrorist attacks using nuclear material or other weapons of mass destruction. Nuclear energy is too expensive and too risky to be a commercially viable venture without government support, he told UPI. &quot;There's a reason no one in the private sector wants to do this with their own money,&quot; Sokolski said. &quot;Nuclear power is a hard sell, literally. ... What the (U.S.) nuclear industry is doing is asking for government handouts, in the form of tax credits, loan guarantees and insurance caps.&quot; Reprocessing is also not economically feasible without government financial support. &quot;Working with plutonium requires special safety measures which are very expensive,&quot; Sokolski said. The idea that new technologies could help make generation or reprocessing economical is &quot;atomic pie in the sky. The advances required are as far off as making fusion-generation practical, in terms of technology.&quot; Expansion is &quot;not inevitable, it is contingent&quot; on U.S. policy changes. &quot;Maybe nuclear power won't expand. It shrank by 2 percent last year,&quot; he said. Sokolski called the report &quot;disappointing.&quot; He said its authors &quot;seem to be in the business of promoting the expansion of nuclear power, rather than examining the risks associated with its expansion. ... They should have explained in more detail why we should be concerned.&quot; But the report does make a bald statement, that the expansion of civil nuclear generating capacity &quot;particularly within Third World nations, inevitably increases the risks of proliferation. What the United States must do,&quot; it concludes, &quot;is find ways to mitigate those risks.&quot; &quot;Something is afoot, and we can't put on blinkers and pretend it's not happening,&quot; said Robinson.<br />

<br />
First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous. Proliferating states will feel great pressures to obtain nuclear weapons and delivery systems before any potential opponent does. Those who succeed in outracing an opponent may consider preemptive nuclear war before the opponent becomes capable of nuclear retaliation. Those who lag behind might try to preempt their opponent’s nuclear programme or defeat the opponent using conventional forces. And those who feel threatened but are incapable of building nuclear weapons may still be able to join in this arms race by building other types of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological weapons. Second, as the world approaches complete proliferation, the hazards posed by nuclear weapons today will be magnified many times over. Fifty or more nations capable of launching nuclear weapons means that the risk of nuclear accidents that could cause serious damage not only to their own populations and environments, but those of others, is hugely increased. The chances of such weapons falling into the hands of renegade military units or terrorists is far greater, as is the number of nations carrying out hazardous manufacturing and storage activities. Increased prospects for the occasional nuclear shootout Worse still, in a highly proliferated world there would be more frequent opportunities for the use of nuclear weapons. And more frequent opportunities means shorter expected times between conflicts in which nuclear weapons get used, unless the probability of use at any opportunity is actually zero. To be sure, some theorists on nuclear deterrence appear to think that in any confrontation between two states known to have reliable nuclear capabilities, the probability of nuclear weapons being used is zero.3 These theorists think that such states will be so fearful of escalation to nuclear war that they would always avoid or terminate confrontations between them, short of even conventional war. They believe this to be true even if the two states have different cultures or leaders with very eccentric personalities. History and human nature, however, suggest that they are almost surely wrong. History includes instances in which states known to possess nuclear weapons did engage in direct conventional conflict. China and Russia fought battles along their common border even after both had nuclear weapons. Moreover, logic suggests that if states with nuclear weapons always avoided conflict with one another, surely states without nuclear weapons would avoid conflict with states that had them. Again, history provides counter-examples. Egypt attacked Israel in 1973 even though it saw Israel as a nuclear power at the time. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands and fought Britain’s efforts to take them back, even though Britain had nuclear weapons. Those who claim that two states with reliable nuclear capabilities to devastate each other will not engage in conventional conflict risking nuclear war also assume that any leader from any culture would not choose suicide for his nation. But history provides unhappy examples of states whose leaders were ready to choose suicide for themselves and their fellow citizens. Hitler tried to impose a ‘victory or destruction’ policy on his people as Nazi Germany was going down to defeat.4 And Japan’s war minister, during debates on how to respond to the American atomic bombing, suggested ‘Would it not be wondrous for the whole nation to be destroyed like a beautiful flower?’5 If leaders are willing to engage in conflict with nuclear-armed nations, use of nuclear weapons in any particular instance may not be likely, but its probability would still be dangerously significant. In particular, human nature suggests that the threat of retaliation with nuclear weapons is not a reliable guarantee against a disastrous first use of these weapons. While national leaders and their advisors everywhere are usually talented and experienced people, even their most important decisions cannot be counted on to be the product of well-informed and thorough assessments of all options from all relevant points of view. This is especially so when the stakes are so large as to defy assessment and there are substantial pressures to act quickly, as could be expected in intense and fast-moving crises between nuclear-armed states.6 Instead, like other human beings, national leaders can be seduced by wishful thinking. They can misinterpret the words or actions of opposing leaders. Their advisors may produce answers that they think the leader wants to hear, or coalesce around what they know is an inferior decision because the group urgently needs the confidence or the sharing of responsibility that results from settling on something. Moreover, leaders may not recognise clearly where their personal or party interests diverge from those of their citizens. Under great stress, human beings can lose their ability to think carefully. They can refuse to believe that the worst could really happen, oversimplify the problem at hand, think in terms of simplistic analogies and play hunches. The intuitive rules for how individuals should respond to insults or signs of weakness in an opponent may too readily suggest a rash course of action. Anger, fear, greed, ambition and pride can all lead to bad decisions. The desire for a decisive solution to the problem at hand may lead to an unnecessarily extreme course of action. We can almost hear the kinds of words that could flow from discussions in nuclear crises or war. ‘These people are not willing to die for this interest’. ‘No sane person would actually use such weapons’. ‘Perhaps the opponent will back down if we show him we mean business by demonstrating a willingness to use nuclear weapons’. ‘If I don’t hit them back really hard, I am going to be driven from office, if not killed’. Whether right or wrong, in the stressful atmosphere of a nuclear crisis or war, such words from others, or silently from within, might resonate too readily with a harried leader. Thus, both history and human nature suggest that nuclear deterrence can be expected to fail from time to time, and we are fortunate it has not happened yet. But the threat of nuclear war is not just a matter of a few weapons being used. It could get much worse. Once a conflict reaches the point where nuclear weapons are employed, the stresses felt by the leaderships would rise enormously. These stresses can be expected to further degrade their decision-making. The pressures to force the enemy to stop fighting or to surrender could argue for more forceful and decisive military action, which might be the right thing to do in the circumstances, but maybe not. And the horrors of the carnage already suffered may be seen as justification for visiting the most devastating punishment possible on the enemy.7 Again, history demonstrates how intense conflict can lead the combatants to escalate violence to the maximum possible levels. In the Second World War, early promises not to bomb cities soon gave way to essentially indiscriminate bombing of civilians. The war between Iran and Iraq during the 1980s led to the use of chemical weapons on both sides and exchanges of missiles against each other’s cities. And more recently, violence in the Middle East escalated in a few months from rocks and small arms to heavy weapons on one side, and from police actions to air strikes and armoured attacks on the other. Escalation of violence is also basic human nature. Once the violence starts, retaliatory exchanges of violent acts can escalate to levels unimagined by the participants beforehand.8 Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse. And such anger can lead us to impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible. In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possible with the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild West of the late 1800s. With most, if not all, nations wearing nuclear ‘six-shooters’ on their hips, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations.<br />

<br />
Moreover, I agree with you that we must find alternatives to oil by investing in new technologies to produce safe, clean, reliable, efficient and inexpensive fuels here at home. The recent high cost of oil and the instability in the Middle East should provide the political will and financial incentive to do just that. In fact, just this week, I sent my policy director Vince Haley on a bio-renewable fuels fact-finding mission in the Midwest.<br />
<br />
<strong>And oil prices spur the transition</strong><br />
Steve <strong>Yetiv</strong> (professor of political science and international studies at Old Dominion University) February 6 20<strong>06</strong> “America benefits from high oil prices,” San Diego Union-Tribune, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:7945:http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060206/news_mz1e6yetiv.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060206/news_mz1e6yetiv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060206/news_mz1e6yetiv.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:7945 --><br />
<br />
In particular, what can high oil prices do that America's energy policy fails to do? First, sooner or later, high oil prices spur the development of alternative energy resources because they make it more profitable to produce them. The higher prices go, the more entrepreneurs and companies around the world work to move us beyond the hazardous petroleum era. Second, the higher oil prices go, the more likely automakers will mass-produce more efficient, less pricey vehicles. That is precisely what we need to shift the current oil-guzzling paradigm. A joint report by the Transportation Research Institute's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan and the Natural Resources Defense Council shows that higher oil prices will hurt America's top automakers by decreasing sales of SUVs and pickup trucks. The report calls on them to make fuel efficient vehicles their top priority to better the country and their bottom line. Most automakers are experimenting with fuel cell vehicles that run on hydrogen rather than oil. They are also selling 2005 hybrid vehicles that run on an internal combustion engine, as do conventional cars, plus an electric motor. Depending on the car, they yield between 10 percent and 50 percent better gas mileage than regular vehicles, and far better mileage than the ubiquitous SUV. But hybrids represent a drop in the market bucket, because automakers have so far made their profits by mass-producing less efficient, money-making vehicles. And fuel cell vehicles aren't expected to reach the market until 2010. High oil prices are an incentive for making efficient vehicles on a mass, affordable scale, and sooner rather than later. Third, high oil prices make consumers less likely to waste gas and more likely to buy hybrids. In Europe, high gas prices – roughly double that in the United States – have led to mass adoption of hybrids. Investment banking firm Goldman Sachs predicts that gas prices would have to hit $4.30 a gallon in the United States to change the gas-guzzling culture. But it is better to see the impact as relative to price. Fourth, high oil prices benefit the environment. Indeed, one study has shown that a broad energy tax on carbon content in fuels would reduce oil use and carbon emissions by over 10 percent. For that matter, vehicles that run on fuel cells emit only water and heat as waste, and hybrids emit more limited emissions than conventional vehicles. Since carbon emissions cause global warming – a scientific fact rather than science fiction – we should tip our hats to high oil prices, in this respect. Fifth, high oil prices are raising consciousness about the hazards of the oil era. Ninety-three percent of Americans believe that oil dependence is a serious problem. Although they still act like oil is an entitlement, pricey oil may lead them eventually to put pressure on politicians to move toward greater oil independence, as reflected perhaps in President Bush's speech. Of course, higher oil prices are painful. But, over time they can serve the environment, decrease our dependence on Middle East oil, especially from countries like Iran which uses oil money to build nuclear capability and force us to take actions that make us less vulnerable when oil starts to dwindle in the future.<br />

We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told the Guardian last week. At first sight this looks like wise counsel from the climate science adviser to Defra. But the idea that we could adapt to a 4C rise is absurd and dangerous. Global warming on this scale would be a catastrophe that would mean, in the immortal words that Chief Seattle probably never spoke, &quot;the end of living and the beginning of survival&quot; for humankind. Or perhaps the beginning of our extinction. The collapse of the polar ice caps would become inevitable, bringing long-term sea level rises of 70-80 metres. All the world's coastal plains would be lost, complete with ports, cities, transport and industrial infrastructure, and much of the world's most productive farmland. The world's geography would be transformed much as it was at the end of the last ice age, when sea levels rose by about 120 metres to create the Channel, the North Sea and Cardigan Bay out of dry land. Weather would become extreme and unpredictable, with more frequent and severe droughts, floods and hurricanes. The Earth's carrying capacity would be hugely reduced. Billions would undoubtedly die. Watson's call was supported by the government's former chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, who warned that &quot;if we get to a four-degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase&quot;. This is a remarkable understatement. The climate system is already experiencing significant feedbacks, notably the summer melting of the Arctic sea ice. The more the ice melts, the more sunshine is absorbed by the sea, and the more the Arctic warms. And as the Arctic warms, the release of billions of tonnes of methane – a greenhouse gas 70 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years – captured under melting permafrost is already under way. To see how far this process could go, look 55.5m years to the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, when a global temperature increase of 6C coincided with the release of about 5,000 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, both as CO2 and as methane from bogs and seabed sediments. Lush subtropical forests grew in polar regions, and sea levels rose to 100m higher than today. It appears that an initial warming pulse triggered other warming processes. Many scientists warn that this historical event may be analogous to the present: the warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth.<br />

<span class="Underline">The US must take the lead in establishing an open dialogue with partner nations on the use of the CTM. A cooperative approach with other nations on the use of CTM will alleviate some fears and misperception about the use of previous nuclear warfare technology for conventional purposes. Likewise, the US should incorporate partner nations in the planning and execution of simulated PGS training exercises. Open disclosure of the CONOPS for the use of CTM as well as the associated SOPs and TTPs would provide transparency to the PGS process and dispel fears the US is launching a possible nuclear attack. In addition, the US must also develop mutual agreements between Russia and the US on a notification process for the imminent launch of a CTM. Based on previous agreements, the US would provide Russia with launch location, anticipated target, and flight trajectory of the missile. Similarly, in anticipation of China’s future capability to track a US launch of a CTM, the US could extend current agreements between China and Russia on launch warning. 69 Such agreements could lay the foundation for mutual security and understanding of the weapon system. Open transparency over the process would dispel concerns over US intentions and help stabilize regional reactions to a CTM launch.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">HANOI--Despite a recent thaw in defense ties between the United States and China, the relationship continues to be marked by deep mutual distrust--with friction over Asian waters becoming especially serious. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his Chinese counterpart, Liang Guanglie, agreed to resume military exchanges. The 30-minute meeting, the first between the two defense chiefs, focused on resuming bilateral military exchanges after a hiatus of eight and a half months. The ministerial meeting here was held on the sidelines of a defense ministers' conference of ASEAN and other countries. Liang told Gates that the United States and China must work to develop deeper strategic trust to reduce unreasonable suspicions and misunderstandings, thereby allowing them to address sensitive issues. Without referring directly to pending problems over the South China Sea, the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, Gates drove home the need to create stable bilateral relations. Even if there are ups and downs, he said the United States and China should try to ensure that bilateral military exchanges are maintained. During the talks, it was agreed that Gates will visit China in January. Beijing had previously turned down a request for Gates to visit. Bilateral exchanges ground to a halt after Washington's decision in January to sell weapons to Taiwan in a deal valued at $6.4 billion (520 billion yen). Beijing, which considers Taiwan an integral part of China, was angered by the sale and took a hard-line stance with Washington. Beijing's recent softening of its position comes as Chinese President Hu Jintao prepares to make a state visit to the United States in January. Drastic changes in the security environment in waters off China's coast, while U.S.-China defense relations were in limbo, prompted the two countries to improve ties. In March, the South Korea Navy corvette Cheonan was sunk in the Yellow Sea. When word got out that the United States and South Korea planned to hold joint military exercises to counter North Korea, China vigorously opposed the move and repeatedly held military drills in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea from June. In July, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared at the ASEAN Regional Forum that &quot;the United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation ... in the South China Sea.&quot; In August, Washington deployed an aircraft carrier to waters off Vietnam as part of a military exchange with Hanoi. In September, relations between Japan and China sharply deteriorated over the arrest of a Chinese trawler captain off the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Clinton stated that the Japan-U.S. security treaty, obliging the United States to assist Japan if it is attacked, covers the islands. Within the Chinese military, there was growing concern that a conflict involving the United States could occur. Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China, said the realization that a clash could erupt prompted the two countries to realize the necessity of creating a mechanism of mutual trust. Though Washington and Beijing have agreed to resume military exchanges, the causes of potential conflict remain unchanged. For its part, the United States seeks to put its relations with China on a better footing. Every time a problem crops up, Beijing tends to freeze its ties with Washington. At the same time, the United States is unwilling to change its basic stance over the Taiwan issue, as well as its policy of free navigation in the South China Sea, which it regards as part of its &quot;national interest.&quot; On the other hand, China insists that in order to maintain balanced bilateral relations, the United States needs to respect China's core interests, such as those concerning Taiwan and Tibet. China remains firm on its intention to be always ready to sever political ties, depending on how Washington behaves.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">NEW YORK (Kyodo) Prime Minister Naoto Kan and U.S. President Barack Obama agreed Thursday their countries will consult closely on the heightened tensions between Japan and China, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tetsuro Fukuyama said. Kan and Obama, meeting in New York on the sidelines of U.N. meetings, also confirmed the importance of the Japan-U.S. security alliance, saying it not only stabilizes the Asia-Pacific region but also serves as a cornerstone for global peace and </span><br />
<span class="Underline">prosperity. With Kan describing the bilateral alliance as &quot;infrastructure&quot; for peace in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the world, the two leaders recognized the need to closely monitor developments in their relations with China, according to Fukuyama, who attended the hourlong summit. Fukuyama said the two leaders didn't have enough time to sufficiently address economic issues, so they didn't touch on the foreign exchange issue despite Japan last week making its first yen-selling intervention in the currency markets in more than six years. It was their second meeting. Kan and Obama first met in June in Toronto. Tensions have been mounting between Japan and China following the Sept. 7 collisions between a Chinese trawler and two Japan Coast Guard patrol boats near the disputed Senkaku Islands, which are administered by Japan but claimed by both China and Taiwan. Prosecutors announced Friday they would free the Chinese skipper. He was arrested Sept. 8 on suspicion of deliberately ramming one of the boats. The arrest sparked protests from China, leading to cancellation of travel, concerts and other cultural and governmental exchanges between the two countries. On the relocation of the Futenma military base in Okinawa, Kan told Obama that his government will implement the bilateral accord reached in May to transfer the facility within the prefecture. Kan said Tokyo will try to gain the understanding of Okinawa residents by carrying out measures to ease the local burden of hosting military bases. Obama said he recognizes difficulties involved in the base issue, Fukuyama said. They also agreed to deepen the bilateral alliance not only in the area of security but also in economic and cultural fields. The two leaders reaffirmed their unity in dealing with North Korea, saying they need to see sincere and positive responses from Pyongyang before agreeing to resume the six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, he said. Kan said North Korea must show a &quot;new stance&quot; on four issues — the deadly sinking of a South Korean ship in March, its nuclear ambitions, its missile program and the past abductions of Japanese nationals. The six-party dialogue involving the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the U.S. have been stalled since December 2008. The North has called for reopening the dialogue, a move supported by China. But Japan, South Korea and the United States are wary in the wake of the ship sinking incident, for which the North has been blamed. Pyongyang categorically denies it had anything to do with the sinking. Obama said he is looking forward to visiting Yokohama in November to attend a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. The president also said he expects to find &quot;ways that we can work together so we can shape an architecture for economic development in the Pacific region.&quot; Kan welcomed the planned U.S. participation in the East Asia Summit and said he would like to lead an initiative to build an East Asian community involving the U.S., Fukuyama said.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Development of missile defense cooperation has been critical to a process of “alliance transformation” that ranges from an updated concept of roles missions and capabilities for defense cooperation, to a realignment of the US force structure in Japan.8 BMD matters have had significant impact on key areas of alliance activity: • Policy: Moving from agreement on the need for missile defense to implementing BMD cooperation has brought policy planners on both sides into closer consultation on regional security strategy, arms control/non-proliferation policy, and an expanding scope of bilateral cooperation. The US government has been obliged to rethink its positions on alliance participation in US missile defense programs, as well as the release of sensitive defense technologies to key allies. Similarly, development of BMD activities will compel the Japanese government to reconsider long-standing positions on such policy-sensitive matters as Japan’s self-imposed ban on collective defense operations, and its inflexible approach to arms export controls (see below). • Operations: Cooperation between Japan and the US on BMD operations in Northeast Asia will require a level of coordination between US and Japanese defense forces that gives unprecedented meaning to the term ‘interoperability.’ Issues of concern here include timely sharing of critical intelligence data, development of an effective command, control, and communications (C3) infrastructure, and revision of outdated polices that obstruct joint response to imminent missile threats. • Acquisitions: The SCD project initiated last year is also unprecedented in being the first effort to jointly develop a defense system for use by both countries – and probably third country allies as well. While this effort may not seem remarkable to those familiar with multinational defense projects in NATO or the EU, implementing SCD has required substantial adjustments in interaction among program management bureaucracies and defense industries on both sides. Here too BMD cooperation has brought both sides beyond the limits of long-established practices and attitudes. Missile defense cooperation points to a critical influence on US-Japan alliance evolution often overlooked in discussion of political leaders or key administration officials – the growth of institutional interaction between the US and Japanese defense establishments.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, we should all take a moment to appreciate the critical contributions the alliance has made to the international community. There have been many challenges over the last 50 years, and there are bound to be more in the future. But the alliance has shown that it is mature, strong and enduring. The American and the Japanese people have never lost sight of the shared values, democratic ideals and common interest in peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region that make for an unshakable alliance. As President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Naoto Kan recently affirmed at the Group of 20 summit in Toronto, the U.S.-Japan alliance continues to be indispensable not only for the defense of Japan, but also for the peace and </span><br />
<span class="Underline">prosperity of the entire Asia-Pacific region. The positive value of the U.S.-Japan alliance is not lost on other countries in the region; the enduring presence of U.S. forces in Japan is the bedrock for prosperity in the region. The continued U.S. presence provides deterrence against acts of aggression and reassures other nations in the region. This presence, and the benefits it provides, is supported by significant Japanese financial contributions. This financial support is essential to the ability of the United States to maintain some of the most advanced military capabilities in the world in Japan. Japan's contribution also supports the U.S. service members prepared to risk their lives in defense of Japan and peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to providing deterrence in a still uncertain region, the presence of U.S. forces allows the United States and Japan to respond to humanitarian and natural disasters and to save lives. With close logistics and operational support from Japan, U.S. forces quickly responded to crises such as the 2009 typhoons in the Philippines, the 2008 Cyclone Nargis in Burma (Myanmar) and the 2007 Cyclone Sidra in Bangladesh. Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF) are increasingly deploying alongside their American partners to address humanitarian challenges in the region, as they did in responding to the 2004 tsunami. For example, earlier this year, Japan deployed the SDF via U.S. mainland bases to provide critical relief to Haiti following 1557-that devastating earthquake. The U.S. Navy and Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) have conducted humanitarian civil assistance activities in Cambodia and Vietnam as part of the PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP 2010 operation. Going forward, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief cooperation will provide countless opportunities for the U.S.-Japan alliance to contribute to the welfare of the region and the world. The United States and Japan also cooperate closely to ensure that every nation has the right to freedom of navigation and access to open sea lanes, thereby providing for the safety of mariners and the security of trade in and out of the region. The JMSDF and the U.S. Navy work hand-in-hand to respond to the recent proliferation of pirate attacks on shipping in and around vital sea lanes, especially off the Horn of Africa. Japan and the United States are partnering to contribute significant resources to building peace and stability in some of the most war-torn places in the world. For example, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, we are cooperating to implement reconstruction and stabilization measures. Over the next 50 years, the United States and Japan look forward to deepening our level of cooperation on other issues as well, particularly in the area of regional missile defense. Japan's decision to invest in advanced AEGIS destroyers, upgrade its Patriot missile battalion, and cooperate with the United States on a next generation of missile defense systems, underscores a firm commitment to enhancing regional deterrence. The United States and Japan will look to grow our partnership in the areas of space and cyber cooperation. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, we recognize the need to strengthen our cooperation under the alliance to promote the security of the global commons, including space and cyberspace. As we move into the future, we will also look to develop new programs for cooperation, like &quot;Green Alliance&quot; initiatives, which aim to promote the use of environmentally friendly technology on Guam and Japan. We also aim to enhance cultural exchanges, education programs and research partnerships. It is often said that the strength of any relationship can be measured by how well it manages challenges, conflicts and crises. Over the past 50 years, the U.S.-Japan alliance has endured all three and emerged stronger and ready to address the challenges of the 21st century. Whether it is working to secure the sea lanes of maritime trade, addressing the challenges posed by the potential spread of weapons of mass destruction, or responding to an increasing array of humanitarian and disaster relief crises around the globe, the U.S.-Japan alliance remains a security cornerstone in a complex world. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The United States and China view the world in starkly different terms. The lesson of the Great Depression and World War II for Americans was that isolationism was self-defeating. Tried after World War I, it failed. The United States had to engage abroad to protect its economy and physical security. These core ideas remain the bedrock justifications for overseas military commitments and the promotion of an open world economy. The quest is for stability, not empire. China, too, covets stability. But its history and perspective are different, as Martin Jacques shows in his masterful &quot;When China Rules the World.&quot; Starting with the first Opium War (1839-42) -- when England insisted on importing opium from India -- China suffered a string of military defeats and humiliating treaties that gave England, France and other nations trading and political privileges. In the 20th century, China was balkanized by civil war and Japanese invasion. Not until the communists' 1949 triumph in the civil war was there again a unified national government. These experiences left legacies: fear of disorder and memory of foreign exploitation. Since 1978, China's economy has increased roughly 10-fold. The prevailing American assumption was that as China became richer, its interests and values would converge with those of the United States. China would depend increasingly on a thriving global economy. Freer domestic markets would loosen the stranglehold of the Communist Party. The United States and China would not always agree, but disputes would be manageable. It isn't turning out that way. A wealthier China has become more assertive, notes Jacques. American prestige has further suffered from the financial crisis originating in the United States. But the fissure goes deeper: China does not accept the legitimacy and desirability of the post-World War II global order, which involves collective responsibility among great powers (led by the United States) for world economic stability and peace. China's policies reflect a different notion: China First. Unlike the isolationist America First movement of the 1930s, China First does not mean global disengagement. It does mean engagement on China's terms. China accepts and supports the existing order when that serves its needs, as when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Otherwise, it plays by its own rules and norms. Trade policy is explicitly discriminatory to address two crucial problems: surplus labor and scarce commodities. The undervalued renminbi aims to help create 20 million or more jobs that Jacques cites as needed annually. China is scouring the globe to make investments in secure raw materials, particularly fuel. The object of &quot;economic reform,&quot; Jacques writes, was &quot;never Westernization&quot; but &quot;a desire to restore the (Communist) Party's legitimacy.&quot; Most American-Chinese disputes reflect China's unwillingness to endanger domestic goals for international ends. It won't commit to binding greenhouse gas cuts because these could reduce economic growth and (again) jobs. On Iran, it values its oil investments more than it fears Iranian nukes. Likewise, it worries that unrest in North Korea could send refugees spilling across the border. Because Taiwan is regarded as part of China, U.S. arms sales there become domestic interference. And censorship is needed to maintain one-party control. China's worldview threatens America's geopolitical and economic interests. Just recently, 19 U.S. trade associations wrote the Obama administration warning that new Chinese rules for &quot;indigenous innovation&quot; could &quot;exclude a wide array of U.S. firms&quot; from the Chinese market -- or force them to turn over advanced technology. (British firms are so incensed by &quot;overwhelming protectionism&quot; that some may quit China, reports the Telegraph newspaper.) It would be a tragedy if these two superpowers began regarding each other as adversaries. But that's the drift. Heirs to a 2,000-year cultural tradition -- and citizens of the world's largest country -- the Chinese have an innate sense of superiority, Jacques writes. Americans, too, have a sense of superiority, thinking that our values -- the belief in freedom, individualism and democracy -- reflect universal aspirations. Greater conflicts and a collision of national egos seem inevitable. No longer should we sit passively while China's trade and currency policies jeopardize jobs here and elsewhere. Political differences between the countries are increasingly hard to ignore. But given China's growing power -- and the world economy's fragile state -- a showdown may do no one any good. Miscalculation is leading us down dark alleys. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Another theme in this year’s DoD report on the Chinese military is its appeal to China to make its military programs and objectives considerably more transparent by disclosing more data and engaging in more comprehensive military exchanges with the U.S. armed forces. Although acknowledging “modest improvements” in this area in recent year, the authors caution that, “The limited transparency in China’s military and security affairs enhances uncertainty and increases the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation.” Conversely, they argue that, “Sustained and reliable U.S.-China military-to-military relations support this goal [of avoiding an adversarial relationship”] by reducing mistrust, enhancing mutual understanding and broadening cooperation.” Unfortunately, the report confirms that, “China’s recurring decision to suspend military exchanges has impeded this effort.” Despite the vigorous efforts of several different U.S. administrations since 1990, little progress has been achieved in the military dialogue between the United States and the PRC during the past two decades. Since the early 1990s, the two defense communities have negotiated a series of bilateral security and confidence-building measures seeking to reduce mutual tensions and advance common interests. These agreements have promoted a better understanding of the other side’s security concerns, but they remain highly constrained and vulnerable to disruption from external shocks. The two governments still fundamentally disagree regarding how to manage military relations in ways that eschew these acute confrontations. Incidents between PRC and U.S. military units operating in the international waters and airspace near China have repeatedly disrupted their bilateral relations. In addition, the PRC frequently suspends Sino-American defense ties due to disputes over Taiwan and other issues, making clear how little Beijing values the relationship between the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and the Pentagon. Several factors have impeded the development of Sino-American defense ties: * The contentious territorial and sovereignty issues have led to recurring PRC-U.S. military confrontations. * Although Chinese and American leaders have long differed over the legitimate extent of Beijing’s control over its EEZ and the South China Sea, the main dispute centers on Taiwan, where the DoD and U.S. arms sales to the Taiwanese government have become the main obstacles to any PLA military occupation of the island. (See sinodefence.com’s coverage of the East China Sea) * These specific territorial-cum-sovereignty disputes have reinforced the often contentious nature of PRC-U.S. political relations, which reflects deep differences between Chinese and American leaders over values as well as their competition for influence in East Asia. The resulting conflicts and mutual suspicions have provided an unfavorable environment for flourishing defense relations. * China’s inferior military capabilities with respect to the United States lead PRC policy makers to conceal information that could provide the DoD with insights into the PLA’s vulnerabilities. * As a rising military power, the Chinese government does not want to codify existing disparities in force capacities or military operating patterns that currently favor the United States. * Influenced by a strategic tradition that emphasizes deception, many PLA strategists believe that opaqueness assists in deterring potential adversaries by complicating their defense planning. * PRC policymakers want to obscure the full extent of their military buildup. The absence of a robust relationship between the Chinese and American militaries is indeed disturbing since the PLA has expanded its level of external engagement considerably in recent years. The December 2008 decision to send a naval task force to assist with the multinational counter-piracy mission off Somalia’s coast has established a precedent for further Chinese military operations at great distances from the PRC. More occasions are likely to arise when Chinese and American ships and other military units operate in close proximity. The PLA’s growing global presence increases the risks of further Chinese-American military incidents, whether due to accidents, miscalculation, or other causes. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">It also seems that China has concluded that, from a technological point of view, systems still have a long way to go before they are actually deployed; some doubt that NMD can really be deployed by the end of 2004, as Bush has promised. Chinese experts are now well-informed about the technical aspects of BMD and, while some remain concerned about the system’s negative implications in the long term, there is a view that its technical effectiveness has been overstated. The current US plan for 20 interceptor missiles, one Chinese arms-control expert notes, does not call for an urgent Chinese response; another believes that ‘China will be able to live with BMD’ while the current architecture remains limited. In the long run, analysts are confident that China will be able to counter BMD: ‘Assuming that Chinese economic growth continues for some time to come, China can easily produce 600 ICBMs [intercontinental ballstic missiles] by 2020 – a figure no BMD can ever deter’. Based on current rates of increase, China’s defence budget could double by 2005. In July 2002, the Pentagon forecast that Chinese annual military spending could increase three- or four-fold in real terms by 2020. There is a view that in any confrontation between offensive ICBMs and BMD, offence is always going to be much cheaper and less technologically demanding than defence. Given the expensive of the BMD project, some in China may even see it as distorting military budgets and so weakening, rather than strengthening, those countries that pursue it </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">The Obama administration’s Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) makes some encouraging changes. The reorientation of threat perception provides the basis for further nuclear disarmament, strengthening of the nonproliferation regime, and broader international cooperation on nuclear security to counter nuclear terrorism, and to facilitate peaceful nuclear use. The declaratory policy makes it clear that the United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) non-nuclear-weapon-states who comply with their treaty obligations, even if they were to pose threats of chemical weapon—and less clearly, biological weapon—attacks. This indicates that the possible use of U.S. nuclear weapons would occur only against the other established nuclear-weapon states, non-NPT states, and NPT members who do not comply with treaty obligations. The NPR further promises that nuclear use will only be considered in “extreme circumstances” and for the “vital interest” of the United States, its allies and partners. Although it fails to adopt the “sole purpose policy” that many have called for, it does make such a policy an objective in the future. The continued nuclear reduction in the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) should be cheered as a step in the right direction, though not as big a step as expected. The significance lies in the momentum the treaty helps to build up. The decision to forsake new nuclear capabilities aimed to fulfill new military missions should not be underappreciated either. However, the reduction of nuclear weapons’ role is one step forward and a half step backward. The negative security assurance to the non-nuclear-weapon states has two conditions: NPT compliance, and the right to reverse. There is still some distance from the “sole purpose policy,” and even more from the no-first-use policy as adopted and suggested by China. Continued maintenance of a triad nuclear force structure, high alert status, and upgraded nuclear weapon infrastructure is justified by the need to maintain strategic stability vis-à-vis Russia and China, even though the former is no longer an enemy and the latter shares increasing responsibilities and interests with the United States. Ballistic missile defense (BMD) and conventionally armed ballistic missiles play a bigger role in deterring potential regional nuclear adversaries and maintaining strategic stability with Russia and China, promising to be a source of tension in the future. In contrast to the previous two post-Cold War NPRs, China receives much more attention. By defining China primarily as a partner for cooperation in international affairs, the new NPR tries to send a positive message to China. At the same time, on behalf of the United States and China’s Asian neighbors, it expresses concerns about the modernization of China’s nuclear arsenal, the lack of transparency, and its future intentions. China is mentioned 37 times in the report, as compared to only twice in what was leaked of the last NPR report. Of the 37, China is mentioned 18 times together with Russia, in the context of “strategic stability.” The emphasis on strategic stability implies that the United States accepts mutual deterrence with China as a reality and will design its nuclear relationship with China based on that reality. This has implications for the U.S.-China nuclear relationship. First, it suggests that the United States will not try to develop offensive and defensive capabilities aimed to negate China’s nuclear deterrent. Second, China still has reason to wonder about the purposes and capabilities of ballistic missile defenses and conventionally armed ballistic missiles. And third, China’s nuclear weapon modernization programs would have a direct impact on U.S. nuclear-related decisions. The United States would like China to contribute its share to the strategic stability. Yet, the issue of Taiwan, which presents a possible scenario for military conflict between China and the United States, is not mentioned at all in the NPR report. This does not mean Taiwan is totally irrelevant. Some hard questions for China to ask include: whether Taiwan will be considered a U.S. partner, for whose defense nuclear weapons are still on the table? Would the status quo of the Taiwan Strait be considered a “vital interest” for the United States? Would China’s military action against Taiwan be viewed as an “extreme circumstance” in which nuclear weapons still have a role to play?</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The U.S.-China military balance undermines PRC confidence that it can deter U.S. intervention on behalf of Taiwan. But given U.S.-China asymmetric interests in Taiwan, the extended deterrence capability of the United States also depends on China’s assessment of U.S. resolve. Although U.S. security interests in Taiwan are limited to reputation interests, China has enough respect for U.S. resolve that U.S.-China asymmetric interests do not appreciatively enhance China’s confidence that it can use force without it leading to U.S. intervention. Chinese civilian and military analysts understand that U.S. domestic politics increases the likelihood of U.S. intervention in defense of Taiwan. Domestic political opposition toward China and political support for Taiwan in the United States are at their highest levels since the late 1960s. U.S. domestic politics has encouraged the growth in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan since the early 1990s, and it will constrain the administration’s options during a mainland- Taiwan conflict. Chinese military and civilian analysts also grasp the extent of Washington’s strategic commitment to Taiwan. They acknowledge that the March 1996 deployment of two U.S. carriers was a “strong military signal” of U.S. readiness to intervene in a possible war over Taiwan.58 Moreover, the carrier deployment firmly coupled the U.S. commitment to defend Taiwan with the credibility of its security commitments to its allies in East Asia. Since then, Chinese leaders have assumed that a war with Taiwan means a war with the United States. As one observer has noted, “What many, many people realize is that the effectiveness of [U.S.] deterrence . . . must markedly exceed that of 1996, so that the likelihood of U.S. military intervention is even more notable, with a likely corresponding escalation in the deterrence dynamics.”59 Another analyst has warned that the possibility of U.S. intervention means that any Chinese action could encounter “unexpectedly serious consequences.”60 Chinese analysts also realize that because of its superiority in long-range, high-accuracy weaponry, the United States can wage war while remaining out of range of enemy forces. Moreover, it can use precision-guided munitions to target leadership command-and-control centers to shorten the war and further reduce casualties. Chinese studies of the 1991 Gulf War conclude that highaccuracy, long-range weaponry was the decisive factor in the U.S. victory. One Chinese military analyst, summing up the impact of high technology on warfare, has argued that “whoever possesses the newest knowledge and technology can thus grab the initiative in military combat and also possess the ‘killer weapon’ to vanquish the enemy.” Moreover, Chinese analysts recognize that the development by the United Sates of increasingly sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will enable U.S. forces to carry out these missions while further reducing their vulnerability to enemy forces.61 Thus the ability of the United States to wage war with minimal casualties contributes to the credibility of its extended deterrence commitments. China’s expectation of U.S. intervention in a mainland-Taiwan war is rejected in various PLA studies. Analyses of blockade operations and warfare against a “large island,” for example, assume the intervention of an advanced power using large surface vessels—including aircraft carriers—which could significantly impede PRC operations.62 PLA studies of the use of its shortrange DF-15 conventional missiles against Taiwan assume that China’s coastal launch sites could be targeted by advanced technology, high-accuracy cruise missiles. Mobility and camouflage are thus critical to PLA planning. The PLA further assumes that in a war over Taiwan its coastal military installations and deployments—including airfields and advanced aircraft, radar, and commandand- control facilities—and civilian and military infrastructure would be vulnerable to devastating air assaults by long-range and highly accurate cruise missiles (similar to those the United States used against Iraq, Serbia, and Afghanistan) and by advanced UAVs. The PLA has reportedly deployed its Russian S-300 surface-to-air missiles around Beijing, in apparent preparation for possible U.S. raids during a mainland-Taiwan war. Chinese leaders understand that the United States can penetrate Chinese airspace as effectively as it penetrated the airspace of Iraq, Serbia, and Afghanistan.63 Beijing’s respect for U.S. resolve and for the high cost of a U.S.-China war produces a very high expected cost of an attack on Taiwan for unification. Accordingly, Chinese military officers and civilian analysts urge caution and promote reliance on “peaceful unification” with Taiwan through long-term development of China’s economy and modernization of its military. “Smooth economic development,” not immediate unification, is China’s most fundamental interest and most important national security strategy. It is also the most effective way to assure Chinese territorial integrity. As long as China’s economy continues to develop, time is on its side.64 As one Chinese analyst has argued, China has already waited 100 years to achieve unification and should be prepared to wait another 50 years.65 For these analysts, China should not use military force for unification, but should continue to deter Taiwan from declaring independence by threatening military retaliation. They argue that as long as Chinese deterrence of Taiwan is effective, China can avoid war with the United States and achieve unification.66</span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">At this stage, it would be difficult to persuade the United States to alter its ballistic missile defense plans, as the GMD system is already being deployed. The United States would, no doubt, refuse such a broad ban. In fact, it is unrealistic to expect that the United States will accept any negotiations on space weapons in the near future. The United States is unlikely to return to anything like the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty – instead, it will seek to retain the right to build and operate at least a ground-based missile defense system. If China wants to move beyond mere complaints towards an actual agreement, then it will have to consider proposals that might conceivably be acceptable to the United States. To overcome the deadlock at CD and to reduce the concerns of both the United States and China, a minimum-scope space weapons ban (the “focused approach”) with some bilateral confidence-building measures could be a practical first step. This approach could include the following two core elements: Banning the testing and deployment of any weapons in outer space, including space-based kinetic energy weapons, space-based directed energy weapons, and any other space-based weapons for attacking space-, ground-, sea-, or air-based targets. This would rule out space-based missile defense and ASAT systems. Banning the testing and deployment of any “dedicated” ASAT weapons. This would include any strike system – whether ground-based, sea-based, air-based or space-based – against orbiting satellites. Subsequently, what is the likelihood of both the United States and China considering a “focused approach” to space weapons? The U.S. Side The United States would likely find a focused approach more acceptable than a broad approach. While it bans space-based weapons and ASATs, the former would allow deployment of the GMD system that composes the central part of the Missile Defense Agency’s current budget and development efforts. In practice, as a number of studies show, there is no rationale for the U.S. to deploy space weapons and ASATs.28 For example, an enormously expensive space-based interceptor system for missile defense would be intrinsically vulnerable to a number of cost-effective ASAT attacks and be overwhelmed by the simultaneous launch of several missiles from a compact area.29 Moreover, the negative impacts of using space weapons for other military missions – protecting satellites, denying the hostile use of space to adversaries and projecting force – would far outweigh the benefits, since the utility of space weapons is limited by three main factors: high cost, considerable susceptibility to countermeasures, and the availability of cheaper, more effective alternatives.30 Furthermore, a space-based BMD system would inevitably encourage other countries to pursue ASATs as countermeasures. Thus, a space weapon ban would reduce the proliferation of ASATs. It would reduce the risk of a “space Pearl Harbor” for other military and civilian satellites. As many experts in the U.S. point out, given the heavy dependence of the United States on its space assets, “the United States has more to lose than to gain by opening the way to the testing and deployment of ASATs and space weapons.”31 The United States is now more dependent on satellites to perform important military functions than any other state. By placing weapons in space, the United States could stimulate others to balance symmetrically and asymmetrically against U.S. space assets. It would be very difficult for the United States to maintain unchallenged hegemony once space is weaponized. The current U.S. military advantage in space instead would be lost, or at a minimum degraded, by weaponization. Further, space weaponization would threaten U.S. civilian and commercial assets by making them far more vulnerable than they are today. The U.S. economy and society are highly dependent on the applications of commercial satellites. In short, as Richard Garwin and his co-authors point out: “A regime that effectively prohibits the deployment of space weapons and the use of destructive ASATs before they can destroy U.S. or other satellites would be a smart, hardnosed investment in U.S. national security, but would require U.S. leadership.”32 It is clear that the United States still has time for serious re-consideration of its space activities. While current funding requests from the Bush administration show continued interest in space-based weapons systems, the actual level of funding is small and these weapons remain in the conceptual and research stages. At the current speed of development, for example, the planned space-based BMD system would not reach fruition until around 2020. China’s Point Of View From the Chinese perspective, a non-space-based BMD system would be less threatening to national security than a space-based one. Countermeasures for mid-course missile defense systems would be less expensive and easier for China to develop. These include decoys, anti-simulation measures33 and an increase in warheads capable of penetrating such a defense system. However, as many scientists point out, a robust, global-coverage BMD system would have to include boost-phase missile defense.34 From the Chinese perspective, a U.S. space-based, boost-phase missile defense system would pose the greatest threat of all. This is due to the fact that at boost phase, the missile defense system would have fewer targets; the target ICBM would be much larger than the normal re-entry vehicle; the target would be much more fragile than a re-entry vehicle; and the target would be easily detectable due to the bright plumes of the burning booster. A non-space-based, boost-phase missile defense system would not be able to cover China’s ICBMs. In fact, an ICBM at an altitude of 200km can be detected within a range of 1,600km by a sensor on the ground, and within 2,000km by a sensor at an altitude of 15km. Because of China’s vast area, the United States would have to destroy a Chinese missile in boost-phase from space.35 As such, even a limited ban on space weapons would significantly reduce the threat for China from U.S. missile defense systems, assuming that Chinese military planners have confidence in countermeasures for midcourse missile defense systems. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Other bilateral confidence-building measures between the United States and China would facilitate China’s consideration of a “focused approach” to space weapons negotiations. These measures might include: (1) A U.S. acknowledgment of the seriousness of China’s concerns, including an assurance that a U.S. missile defense system will not target China; (2) A U.S. pledge to adopt a bilateral no-first-use policy toward China, following the example of similar Chinese and Russian policies; such a policy would ease China’s major concern about the possibility of a U.S. preemptive strike; (3) The clear exclusion of Taiwan in the U.S.-Japan joint theater missile defense plan, and a U.S. move to block the sale of such systems to Taiwan; (4) A limitation on the scale and scope of the envisioned U.S. non-space-based BMD architecture, including placing a limit on the number of missile defense interceptors and restricting the scope of the overall system to the minimum required for dealing with rogue threats. This latter measure would ensure that China’s current stock of fissile materials would be sufficient to fill the number of new warheads needed to balance U.S. missile defense interceptors. In the absence of any limitations on U.S. missile defense systems, China harbors concerns about whether its current fissile material stocks are extensive enough to supply the warheads needed to counter the U.S. threat to its nuclear deterrent. This directly affects China’s willingness to participate in the Fissile Material Cut- Off Treaty. Restrictions on the U.S. BMD system would also ensure that China builds its nuclear arsenal in a predictable way – until it has the capacity to balance the U.S. defensive capabilities – which the United States would acknowledge and understand.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">In mid-January, Defense Secretary Robert Gates approved an order to send an additional 3,000 U.S. marines into Afghanistan in anticipation of the now annual Taliban spring offensive. It was the right thing to do, but such a temporary force increase falls far short of what is needed. U.S. military policy is still stumbling toward failure in Afghanistan—a failure that will likely have dire consequences beyond South Asia. Let’s be clear: The mission in Afghanistan is not in jeopardy mainly because NATO members refuse to provide sufficient troops or appropriate engagement protocols for the International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF). Neither is the mission in jeopardy because of any deficiency inherent in U.S. or Coalition counterinsurgency doctrine. The problem goes deeper, into the underlying political context of Coalition military operations. The real issue is the transitory and uncertain U.S. military posture in Afghanistan (and, by implication, across South Asia), which undermines the necessary link between relevant military security operations and positive political consequences. Our uncertain commitment to Afghanistan has the effect of bolstering Taliban propaganda, which threatens to punish anyone cooperating with Coalition efforts. This intimidation of critical local U.S. allies, fueled by a credible fear that the United States will leave them in the lurch, is shaping conditions for a major failure in our counterinsurgency and counter-terror programs. Our unwillingness to commit ourselves for the long haul also provides incentives for Pakistan to hedge its bets. The U.S. government has urged the Pakistani government to act decisively to deal with its side of the Afghan-Pakistan border to dry up support for the Taliban effort in Afghanistan. But doing so entails significant risk for Pakistan, both internally and regionally. No Pakistani government, military or civilian led, will take those risks unless it knows U.S. power will remain engaged to backstop the effort. The only way to change the poisonous regional security dynamic that keeps Pakistan a safe haven for terrorists and jeopardizes Afghanistan’s future is to alter fundamentally the convoluted U.S. political strategy that has gone unchallenged over the past six years. There are understandable reasons for portraying the U.S. presence in Afghanistan as temporary, and for mixing into ISAF as many non-U.S. contributions as possible. The United States is not an imperial power and does not wish to be perceived as such in a region justifiably allergic to European colonial legacies. Nevertheless, those reasons do not outweigh the liabilities that the present policy brings. We must eliminate the uncertainty about U.S. staying power by strengthening and institutionalizing the U.S. security commitment to the region. The next administration, if not the present one, has a difficult but necessary choice to make that has been ducked for far too long. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Reorienting the counterinsurgency campaign. The third important change at the strategic level that the Obama administration must direct is the reorientation of the ongoing counterinsurgency campaign to focus on the simple, yet radical, objectives of protecting civilians over destroying the enemy; protecting civilians by accepting risks if necessary to the safety of coalition forces; and protecting civilians by using at all possible times minimum rather than maximum force. The administration’s White Paper thankfully makes this objective its own when it declares that “our counter-insurgency strategy must integrate population security with building effective local governance and economic development. We will establish the security needed to provide space and time for stabilization and reconstruction activities.”77 The protection of the population must once again take center stage in the conduct of coalition military operations in Afghanistan. The U.S. Army’s new counterinsurgency manual, FM 3-24, directs that the mission be prosecuted in exactly this way. It is also the manner in which the United States systematically conducted counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan from late 2003 until 2005. After 2005, the U.S. military leadership in Afghanistan drifted back into an excessively “kinetic” approach to counterinsurgency, in which the use of superior firepower to attack insurgent groups took priority over protecting the population among whom they operated. Whatever this way of doing things gained in terms of enemy kills, it lost just as much if not more in terms of popular support for the coalition’s war against the Taliban, thanks to the awful increases in collateral damage produced by this strategy. As a result, the Taliban were able to replenish their ranks from the increasingly disaffected populace far faster than the U.S. military was able to destroy them.78 The continuance of such an attrition-centered counterinsurgency strategy will contribute ultimately to the defeat of the United States in Afghanistan because it will deepen the alienation within the population and increase support for the Taliban uprising. It is often easy to forget—especially by a technologically superior force—that the strategic goal of any counterinsurgency campaign is not the comprehensive physical destruction of the insurgents in the first instance, but rather shaping the political end game such that the people, among whom the insurgency operates, gradually shift their loyalties toward the state and away from the resistance. Strengthening this dynamic requires that the population be convinced that the government of the day will provide it, first and foremost, with personal security, namely that which Hobbes called the freedom from “fear of sudden death.” Loyalty toward the government is also enhanced by the provision of effective governance (meaning the presence of law and order and the speedy delivery of justice), responsive government (that is, rule that in some way incorporates consent and embodies binding ties between rulers and ruled at various levels), and minimal development (which must include the availability of adequate sustenance to ensure physical survival together with some opportunities to better one’s station in life). These attributes of good government are particularly essential in Afghanistan because the threats to the lives of the common folk derive not simply from the insurgency but also from local predators such as drug rings, criminals, warlords, militias, tribal and village power brokers, and even petty government officials. When the hazards of coalition military operations against the Taliban are added to this list, the net result is that the already strong anger harbored by the population toward the government for its inability to ensure personal security—the first task of any legitimate state—is deepened further and transmuted into an antagonism directed equally at Kabul and the coalition. If the United States, therefore, is to win the war against the Taliban, it must make as its primary order of business the provision of what William Maley has correctly identified as “human security”79 and that requires, as Gilles Dorronsoro notes, reversing “the current trend of ever increasing violence.”80 If the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy can shift its emphasis from primarily killing the insurgents to protecting the population, the social medium within which the Taliban now thrives will progressively become inhospitable. When that outcome obtains, the insurgency will either die a slow death or be reduced to a law-and-order problem that can be controlled by local police or other law enforcement agencies. From late 2003 through 2005, the United States prosecuted counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan in exactly this way. Operating under a unified civilian-military leadership collocated at the U.S. embassy in Kabul, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and Lieutenant General David W. Barno, commander of CFC-A, implemented a comprehensive counterinsurgency strategy that combined antiterrorism and anti-insurgency operations, the training of Afghan security forces, the delivery of reconstruction and governance, and regional engagement through an “area ownership” approach that emphasized the protection of the Afghan population above all else. The strategy of area ownership was a military innovation that was uniquely Barno’s: in institutionalizing this concept of operations, he overturned—incidentally, without authority—the previous U.S. overemphasis on counterterrorism, prosecuted mainly through kinetic attacks, in favor of an integrated counterinsurgency strategy that tied together multiple political, military, development, and information operations in the service of protecting the Afghan people.81 This innovation, which occurred long before the current U.S. Army counterinsurgency manual was revised to incorporate a similar approach, paid off in spades. Consequently, even though the Taliban insurgents were slowly creeping back from Pakistan to Afghanistan during this period, the political environment within Afghanistan was quite inhospitable to their operations.82 </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">The Road to Regional Transformation Achieving the Modern Silk Road is as much a challenge as it is a requirement for long-term success in Afghanistan. The U.S. government, in close consultation with regional players, must formulate practical policies to help tear down the obstacles outlined above and lay the groundwork for regional development and for the sustainable Afghan economy it would help create. Specifically, the U.S. government should focus on eight actions. First, the U.S. government should recognize the potential benefits of a Modern Silk Road and make its implementation a strategic priority. This effort should be linked with the unique opportunity created by the NDN. Second, the administration should create a long-term strategy for the Modern Silk Road’s development where trade with Afghanistan is the foundation for this approach. Third, to be successful, the United States must work with regional governments, donors, and other stakeholders in a coordinated manner. To build momentum for this engagement, the United States should undertake a comprehensive communications campaign that generates incentives to invest into the Silk Road concept. Fourth, while many U.S. government entities have an important role to play in the creation of the Modern Silk Road, a single coordinating body is necessary. This entity should be explicitly identified and empowered by the administration. The National Security Council is the likely organization for this task, and should undertake this effort as a high presidential priority in conjunction with other policies intended to promote long-term stabilization of Afghanistan.36 Fifth, even though the NDN has served as an incremental step toward regional integration, U.S. planners should seek access to additional corridors into Afghanistan. These include the following routes from Iran—Afghanistan (beginning in the Iranian port of Chabahar and entering Afghanistan at the border town of Zaranj before continuing to the Afghan ring road at Delaram), China—Central Asia—Afghanistan (originating in China’s Pacific ports and traveling via road and rail lines before entering Afghanistan), China—Pakistan— Afghanistan (beginning in China’s Pacific ports and transiting the Karakorum highway in Pakistan), Pakistan—Afghanistan (beginning at the Pakistani port of Gwadar and transiting Baluchistan before entering Afghanistan), and India— Pakistan—Afghanistan. While the challenges associated with these routes are apparent, the United States should put forth a concerted effort to gain access to them. (After all, who could have predicted that U.S. military supplies would be traversing Russia and Uzbekistan?) If the United States proves unable to make use of these routes,Washington should encourage and facilitate other Afghan-bound traffic to travel on them. Increasing intercontinental transport through these corridors is critical. Sixth, the United States and other stakeholders should partner with local governments to tear down the bureaucratic obstacles to trade outlined earlier. To accomplish this critical task, U.S. officials and other donors must demonstrate the value of such reform and provide financial and technical assistance in a manner that does not encroach on the sovereignty of these states. This initiative should be fully resourced and include development of streamlined, efficient, and more corruption-resistant procedures, especially at border crossings.37 Moreover, a determined effort should be made to coordinate existing aid programs designed to achieve the same result. Seventh, an increase in legal cross-border commerce will not help stabilize Afghanistan unless the country develops the capacity to levy official taxes on trade and turn this activity into sustainable income. The United States, Japan, and other donors should work with the Afghan government to build this capability in a manner that marginalizes the informal economy and discourages official corruption. And finally, the Obama administration must recognize that the Modern Silk Road will benefit all of Eurasia. Geopolitical competition in Eurasia is often seen in zero-sum terms. As a result, a strong U.S. push will likely be misconstrued as an effort to assert some sort of advantage over other regional players. Washington should be attuned to this inevitability and be prepared to articulate how the initiative will benefit partners and rivals alike. If this aspect is ignored, potential spoilers will be more likely. The NDN has provided the United States a unique, yet fleeting opportunity to develop the Modern Silk Road. In the end, if the opportunity offered by the Modern Silk Road is ignored, everything the United States will have achieved in Afghanistan will be short-lived, and instability will likely remain a permanent fixture in the heart of Eurasia. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The nation mourns the men and women in uniform who are killed or wounded in Iraq, one by one. But the public needs to be aware, and be worried, about the larger picture too. Our military and our military readiness have been strained and risk real, permanent damage. Twenty-five years ago, America's Army was a lot larger and had a lot less to do. Now, a substantially smaller force is struggling to cope with the demands placed on it by Iraq, where boots on the ground are in chronically short supply. For much of the past two years, the bulk of America's frontline ground forces have been tied down in an open-ended counterinsurgency war they were not expected, or given the resources, to fight. These soldiers and marines, active-duty and Reserve, have shown courage and determination, despite shortages of armor and other equipment, involuntarily extended enlistments and accelerated rotations back into combat. Their fortitude has allowed the Pentagon to sustain a situation that everyone recognizes cannot go on indefinitely, even though no end to the Iraqi conflict is yet in sight. The extended unplanned deployment of American forces is taking a heavy cumulative toll, especially on the Army and Army National Guard. It is undermining readiness and morale, and limiting America's ability to send substantial ground forces elsewhere to back up its diplomacy or respond to emerging threats. The Pentagon is beginning to resemble a desperate farmer who feeds his starving family the seed corn meant for sowing next year's crop. To keep enough boots on the ground now, it is sacrificing the ability to retain the leaders of tomorrow. As overdeployment has become chronic, promising young officers are opting not to re-enlist. When new crops of young people graduate from school, they will be less willing to combine their civilian careers with service in the Army National Guard; recruitment is already down almost 30 percent. The Regular Army is hurting too. Despite enlistment bonuses, it has had to speed up its reporting schedules, sending new recruits straight into basic training. This growing crisis is not due to a lack of preparedness on the part of military brass, but to the ideology on which preparedness was based. Before Iraq, Pentagon dogma - supported by most Republican politicians and many conservative Democrats - held that United States troops were war fighters. Peacekeeping and nation-building were jobs for Old Europe. Well, that was then. Now, more than half of the Regular Army's fighting forces have either served in Iraq, are currently there or can expect to be on their way soon, along with a substantial fraction of the Marine Corps and historically high proportions of the Army National Guard and Reserves. Rotations are being accelerated, with units that have already served in Iraq returning for second tours. These faster rotations are degrading readiness, wearing down equipment and leaving less time for normal training exercises. Reservists, including police, firefighters and other homeland defenders, are spending lengthy tours overseas. Four out of 10 Americans now serving in Iraq come from Reserve or National Guard units. None of this should lead Americans to worry that the United States - with the world's premier Air Force, Navy and nuclear strike force fully intact - is defenseless. If a new threat suddenly arose - if, for example, Al Qaeda threatened Saudi oil fields, radical Islamist officers got control of Pakistani nuclear weapons or China attacked Taiwan - Washington could respond forcefully and decisively. But that does not mean that broader American security interests are not paying a price. Any additional foreign engagement that dragged on beyond a few months and required large numbers of ground troops would require a wider call-up of reserves and perhaps a return to the draft. Many potential enemies overseas doubt that the public would have the appetite for that kind of sacrifice. As a result, America's diplomatic clout is being subtly undermined. Iranian mullahs weighing whether to give up their nuclear programs may conclude that Washington is in no position to face them down. North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong Il, may also feel freer to proceed with his nuclear plans and move troops closer to the South Korean border. Chinese leaders may see this as an opportune time to escalate their bullying of Taiwan. Listing all the dangers is much easier than coming up with solutions. But there are some obvious short-term answers. Barring any unexpected breakthroughs in Iraq, Washington needs to increase its recruitment quotas sharply for active-duty service in the Army and Marine Corps. The current Army recruitment ceiling of just above 500,000 ought to go up to nearly 600,000, still substantially below the levels of the late 1980's. The Marines' ceiling should go up from the current 178,000 to around 200,000. Attracting those recruits will require offering financial and other inducements on top of the added payroll costs. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">How Colombia Fixed Its Army Reform of Colombia’s army began during Andrés Pastrana’s term as president (1998–2002) and accelerated during Pres. Álvaro Uribe’s tenure (2002–present).16 Three key reforms converted the Colombian army from an ineffective, garrison-bound band into an aggressive force that has crippled the FARC and ELN. New Leadership In 1998, at the urging of US officials, Pastrana replaced the top three leaders in the army with new generals (Fernando Tapias, Jorge Enrique Mora, and Carlos Ospina) who were trained at US military schools and who had extensive combat experience at the battalion and brigade levels.17 This new trio then replaced their subordinate commanders who lacked aggressiveness in the field. At this time, the Colombian army began to emphasize the selection and training of better-quality noncommissioned officers for the army’s combat units.18 In his book A Question of Command, Mark Moyar studies a variety of counterinsurgency campaigns, asserting that leadership quality rather than campaign plans or tactics is the key to success.19 Colombia’s performance against its insurgents bolsters Moyar’s argument. Reorganization Beginning with the Pastrana administration and extending into Uribe’s, Colombia reorganized its army into a mobile and highly skilled professional component; additionally, a draftee component formed for local security.20 Under the tutelage of trainers from US Army special forces, the professional component of the army established numerous air-mobile, ranger, mountain-warfare, counterdrug, and special forces battalions.21 These units improved the army’s overall effectiveness by specializing in specific tasks. Perhaps as important, Uribe focused the draftee portion of the army on village defense. He created more than 600 home-guard platoons, each composed of about 40 soldiers stationed in their hometowns, to provide basic security and collect intelligence on insurgent activity. These platoons interdicted the movement of insurgent units in the countryside and freed the professional army for offensive operations.22 The Colombian army also increased spending on logistics support and intelligence analysis, activities supported by the US advisory team.23 Helicopters Finally, Colombia’s army and police expanded their inventory of helicopters from about 20 in 1998 to 255 by late 2008. To overcome Colombia’s mountainous and forested terrain, the army needed air mobility. Today, with extensive US support, the Colombian army operates the world’s third-largest fleet of UH-60 Blackhawk assault helicopters.24 Colombia’s helicopter fleet has made possible the army’s offensive doctrine against insurgent support areas. As a result of these and other reforms, the Colombian army inflicted severe damage on the FARC and ELN. One study estimated that, between 2002 and 2008, army attacks cut FARC offensive capabilities by 70 percent. By 2008 FARC military units, which overwhelmed Colombian army battalions in the 1990s, were unable to function in units larger than squad size. Between 2006 and 2008, more than 3,000 FARC fighters deserted the organization. FARC’s remaining forces are believed to be scattered, disorganized, and cut off from their top-level leadership, which has fled into exile in Ecuador and Venezuela.25 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">President Obama once said withdrawal from Afghanistan would begin in July 2011 — maybe, conditions permitting. But then he backed off that date. Now NATO, echoing American officials, says security won’t be fully turned over to the Afghan government any earlier than the end of 2014 — again, maybe; the alliance has signed a long-term security agreement with the Afghan president. Allied troops thus will remain in Afghanistan — as occupiers always say — in a supporting role beyond 2014 and even 2015. Calling the December 31, 2014, an “aspirational goal,” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said, “It does not mean that all U.S. or coalition forces would necessarily be gone by that date.” Even before Obama backed off the 2011 timetable and before the NATO summit, Gen. David Petraeus had told Bob Woodward, “You have to recognize that I don’t think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. You have to stay after it. This is the kind of fight we’re in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids’ lives.” And Defense Secretary Robert Gates went even further, telling Woodward: “We’re not leaving Afghanistan prematurely. In fact, we’re not ever leaving at all.” Thus no one seems to take target dates or even aspirational goals very seriously. The U.S. national-security apparatus is planted in Afghanistan and appears in no hurry to leave. This is confirmed by concrete facts. Award-winning investigative journalist Nick Turse notes that the U.S. government is engaged in a “base-building surge that has left the countryside of Afghanistan dotted with military posts, themselves expanding all the time, despite the drawdown of forces promised by President Obama beginning in July 2011.” Turse says government documents “reveal plans for large-scale, expensive Afghan base expansions of every sort and a military that is expecting to pursue its building boom without letup well into the future. These facts-on-the-ground indicate that, whatever timelines for phased withdrawal may be issued in Washington, the U.S. military is focused on building up, not drawing down, in Afghanistan.” Turse has examined plans to expand a variety of military facilities at a cost of tens of millions of dollars, with completion not expected until well past the time the American withdrawal was supposed to commence. The facilities include airstrips that support large transport aircraft, “airfield parking space,” maintenance installations, ammunition storages, and living quarters for troops. “Documents reveal that this sort of expansion is now going on at a remarkably rapid pace all over the country,” Turse writes. “…And whenever you stumble upon a document indicating that work of a certain sort is taking place at one FOB [forward operating base], you can be sure that, sooner or later, you will find similar work at other FOBs.” The magnitude of the building project is extraordinary, Turse says. After describing the enhancement of FOB Shindand in western Afghanistan, documented by the Washington Post, Turse comments: “Multiply this, FOB by FOB, the length and breadth of Afghanistan, and you have a building program fit for a long war.” Eyebrows should have been raised, Turse notes, when Petraeus told ABC News last year that the military had “finally gotten the inputs right in Afghanistan” and that the “counterinsurgency clock” had restarted. Really? After years of occupation and untold deaths and injuries the military is just now claiming that it is getting things right. “But it is just at this point that we feel that we do have the organizations that we learned in Iraq and from history are necessary for the conduct [of] this kind of campaign,” Petraeus said. This sounds like a talking point. The Iraqi occupation has empowered the Iran-backed Shi’a majority, which does not need a U.S. presence to survive. There is nothing comparable in Afghanistan, where the U.S. government backs a puppet minority government in Kabul that has little legitimacy in the rest of the country. “The building boom occurring on U.S. bases across Afghanistan and the contracts for future construction being awarded at the moment,” Turse writes, “seem to confirm that, whatever the White House has in mind, the military is operating on something closer to the Petraeus timeline.…” </span><br />

<span class="Underline">It is very likely that the insurgency will grow in size and strength in 2010 faster than Afghan security forces can be developed without the addition of significant numbers of American combat troops. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">If the United States should adopt a small-footprint counterterrorism strategy, Afghanistan would descend again into civil war. The Taliban group headed by Mullah Omar and operating in southern Afghanistan (including especially Helmand, Kandahar, and Oruzgan Provinces) is well positioned to take control of that area upon the withdrawal of American and allied combat forces. The remaining Afghan security forces would be unable to resist a Taliban offensive. They would be defeated and would disintegrate. The fear of renewed Taliban assaults would mobilize the Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras in northern and central Afghanistan. The Taliban itself would certainly drive on Herat and Kabul, leading to war with northern militias. This conflict would collapse the Afghan state, mobilize the Afghan population, and cause many Afghans to flee into Pakistan and Iran. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Within Pakistan, the U.S. reversion to a counterterrorism strategy (from the counterinsurgency strategy for which Obama reaffirmed his support as recently as August) would disrupt the delicate balance that has made possible recent Pakistani progress against internal foes and al Qaeda. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari, army chief of staff General Ashfaq Kayani, and others who have supported Pakistani operations against the Taliban are facing an entrenched resistance within the military and among retired officers. This resistance stems from the decades-long relationships nurtured between the Taliban and Pakistan, which started during the war to expel the Soviet Army. Advocates within Pakistan of continuing to support the Taliban argue that the United States will abandon Afghanistan as it did in 1989, creating chaos that only the Taliban will be able to fill in a manner that suits Pakistan. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Zardari and Kayani have been able to overcome this internal resistance sufficiently to mount major operations against Pakistani Taliban groups, in part because the rhetoric and actions of the Obama administration to date have seemed to prove the Taliban advocates wrong. The announcement of the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces would prove them right. Pakistani operations against their own insurgents--as well as against al Qaeda, which lives among those insurgents--would probably grind to a halt as Pakistan worked to reposition itself in support of a revived Taliban government in Afghanistan. And a renewed stream of Afghan refugees would likely overwhelm the Pakistani government and military, rendering coherent operations against insurgents and terrorists difficult or impossible. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The collapse of Pakistan, or even the revival of an aggressive and successful Islamist movement there, would be a calamity for the region and for the United States. It would significantly increase the risk that al Qaeda might obtain nuclear weapons from Pakistan's stockpile, as well as the risk that an Indo-Pakistani war might break out involving the use of nuclear weapons. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">In August, President Obama laid out the rationale for stepping up the fight in Afghanistan: If left unchecked, the Taliban insurgency will mean an even larger safe haven from which al-Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans. So this is not only a war worth fighting. This is fundamental to the defense of our people. Obamas Af-Pak plan is, in essence, a countersanctuary strategy that denies safe havens to the Taliban and al-Qaeda, with the overriding goal of making America and its allies safer. Under Obama, the Pentagon has already sent a surge of 21,000 troops to Afghanistan, and the Administration is even weighing the possibility of deploying as many as 40,000 more. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">This is a sound policy. If U.S. forces were not in Afghanistan, the Taliban, with its al-Qaeda allies in tow, would seize control of the country's south and east and might even take it over entirely. A senior Afghan politician told me that the Taliban would be in Kabul within 24 hours without the presence of international forces. This is not because the Taliban is so strong; generous estimates suggest it numbers no more than 20,000 fighters. It is because the Afghan government and the 90,000--man Afghan army are still so weak. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The surreal belief in some quarters that abandoning Afghanistan -- described as a &quot;graveyard of empires&quot; with its complicated tribes, forbidding terrain, and peripheral strategic importance -- would not have direct and bloody consequences for the United States, never mind the Afghan people, can be answered with three numbers: 9-11. It is troubling that our political and foreign policy elites even need to engage this debate (including its more sophisticated but equally illusory variants like moving to an &quot;over-the-horizon&quot; strike-and-retreat strategy). At the same time, the experts (correctly) advocating a counterinsurgency strategy make the same mistake of framing their arguments purely with reference to Afghanistan's internal dynamics. As important as they are, they constitute only part of a wider strategic landscape that would be upended by a U.S. decision to reduce its political and military commitment to Afghanistan. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">A recent trip to Islamabad and Lahore revealed to me that most Pakistani elites -- including the small minority that could credibly be described as sympathetic to Western goals in Afghanistan -- already believe that the game is up: the will of the transatlantic allies is broken, Obama doesn't have the courage or vision to see America's mission in Afghanistan through to victory, and the U.S. is well along the road to walking away from Afghanistan as it did after 1989. This widespread Pakistani belief has encouraged behavior deeply inimical to Washington's regional aims, with the effect that the American debate over whether Afghanistan is worth it is inspiring Pakistani actions that will make success all the harder to achieve. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">After all, why shouldn't the Pakistani security services continue to invest in their friendly relations with the Taliban if Mullah </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Omar and company soon will take power in Afghanistan's Pashtun heartland? Why should the Pakistani military take on the militant groups that regularly launch cross-border attacks into Afghanistan when the NATO targets of those attacks will soon slink away in defeat? Why should the Pakistani government get serious about wrapping up the Quetta Shura when the Afghan Taliban appears to be ascendant in the face of Western weakness? Why should Pakistan's intelligence service break its ties to Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of the world's most potent terrorist groups, when it forms such a useful instrument with which to bleed U.S. ally India? And why should Pakistani civilian and military leaders overtly cooperate with the United States when it appears such a weak and unreliable ally of the Afghan people -- incapable, despite its singular wealth and resources, of defeating a 25,000-man insurgency in one of the poorest countries on Earth? </span><br />
<span class="Underline">As Chris Brose and I recently argued, it is vital for the West to prevail in Afghanistan because of its effect in shaping Pakistan's strategic future. Proponents of drawing down in Afghanistan on the grounds that Pakistan is the more important strategic prize have it only half right: if Pakistan is the strategic prize, it should be unthinkable not to press for victory in Afghanistan given the spillover effects of a Western defeat there. All of Pakistan's pathologies -- from terrorist sanctuary in ungoverned spaces, to radicalized public opinion that creates an enabling environment for violent extremism, to lack of economic opportunity that incentivizes militancy, to the (in)security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, to the military's oversized role in political life in ways that stunt the development of civilian institutions -- all of this will intensify should Afghanistan succumb to the Taliban as the West withdraws.These dynamics, in turn, will destabilize India in ways that could torpedo the country's rise to world power -- and the strategic dividends America would reap from India's success. New Delhi is now a truer proponent of Washington's original objectives in Afghanistan -- the Taliban's decisive defeat by military force rather than reconciliation and the construction of a capable Afghan democracy -- than some American leaders are now. Afghanistan is in India's backyard -- they shared a border until 1947 -- and the collapse of its government would destabilize Pakistan in ways that would quickly cost Indian dearly. Indian strategists fear that the spillover from a Taliban victory in Afghanistan would induce Pakistan's &quot;Lebanonization,&quot; with the Pakistani Taliban becoming a kind of South Asian Hezbollah that would launch waves of crippling attacks against India. India cannot rise to be an Asian balancer, global security provider, and engine of the world economy if it is mired in interminable proxy conflict with terrorists emanating from a weak or collapsing state armed with nuclear weapons on its border. </span><br />

<span class="Underline"> Not much chance Obama will go that route. If the violence skyrockets next year and it looks as though the president’s ambitious objectives can’t be met, Afghanistan could look a lot more like Vietnam in 1973. U.S. forces withdrew. Our abandoned ally was soon overrun. South Vietnam became a gulag; Cambodia sprouted the killing fields; life in Laos was just plain lousy. By 1979, the Sino-Vietnamese war erupted. We can expect similar results if Obama’s Afghan strategy fails and he opts to cut and run. Most forget that throwing South Vietnam to the wolves made the world a far more dangerous place. The Soviets saw it as an unmistakable sign that America was in decline. They abetted military incursions in Africa, the Middle East, southern Asia and Latin America. They went on a conventional- and nuclear-arms spending spree. They stockpiled enough smallpox and anthrax to kill the world several times over. State-sponsorship of terrorism came into fashion. Osama bin Laden called America a “paper tiger.” If we live down to that moniker in Afghanistan, odds are the world will get a lot less safe. Al-Qaida would be back in the game. Regional terrorists would go after both Pakistan and India—potentially triggering a nuclear war between the two countries. Sensing a Washington in retreat, Iran and North Korea could shift their nuclear programs into overdrive, hoping to save their failing economies by selling their nuclear weapons and technologies to all comers. Their nervous neighbors would want nuclear arms of their own. The resulting nuclear arms race could be far more dangerous than the Cold War’s two-bloc standoff. With multiple, independent, nuclear powers cautiously eyeing one another, the world would look a lot more like Europe in 1914, when precarious shifting alliances snowballed into a very big, tragic war. The list goes on. There is no question that countries such as Russia, China and Venezuela would rethink their strategic calculus as well. That could produce all kinds of serious regional challenges for the United States. Our allies might rethink things as well. Australia has already hiked its defense spending because it can’t be sure the United States will remain a responsible security partner. NATO might well fall apart. Europe could be left with only a puny EU military force incapable of defending the interests of its nations. None of this is to suggest that staying in Afghanistan is an easy option. Wars never are. They require good men and women to put their lives on the line every day for our security. We should put them at risk only for an issue of vital national interest. Afghanistan is one such issue. And that—not cost—is the real bottom line. The war won’t bankrupt America. Multitrillion dollar proposals like “cap and trade” environmental schemes or government-managed health systems might well kill our economy. But the $30 billion required for the Afghanistan surge represents about 0.20 percent of our GDP. In terms of D.C. budget debates, that’s a rounding error. But in terms of national security, the cost of failure in Afghanistan would be incalculably high. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">However, there is some space between U.S. and Russian interests if it comes to a NATO defeat and withdrawal from Afghanistan. In lieu of a complete U.S. victory over the Taliban and other jihadists in Afghanistan as well as the cap¬ture of al Qaeda’s leadership, most important Osama bin Laden, Russia’s inter¬ests would be served more by the West’s long-term engagement of jihadists in Afghanistan and Pakistan than by defeat and withdrawal, thus containing the threat to South Asia and bog down the United States, NATO, al Qaeda, and jihadists in the region, diverting their attention and resources from deployment elsewhere. If there were a NATO withdrawal, Russia and/or others might be tempted to enhance the already growing military component of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO; members include Russia, China, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; observer-members are Pakistan, India, Iran, and Mongolia) and employ it to defeat or contain jihadism in Central Asia.5 Such actions would be more costly for Moscow, and many Russians would blame the regional crisis on American hubris or even conspiracies, further damaging U.S.-Russian relations. A SCO role would involve China even more deeply in the region, something that is probably neither in Russia’s nor America’s interests. In this event, Moscow likely would promote a more virulently anti-Western, especially anti-American, and perhaps “Eurasianist” line, proposing an alliance of non-Western civilizations to counter American hegemony. In the long-term, this could compensate Russia’s Muslims for Moscow’s war against foreign Muslims and rally some Islamic states toward SCO, further threaten¬ing American interests. At present, Moscow supports U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, where the West is doing heavy lifting for the Kremlin. It is imperative that Moscow’s support continues and grows, even if NATO draws back from ground operations to covert and air operations. It is in the American and Russian interest to maxi¬mize reconstruction, intelligence, security, and, perhaps in the future, limited military forms of cooperation in Afghanistan. Otherwise, as Barnett Rubin and Ahmed Rashid have warned, Afghanistan and Central Asia could be trans-formed into yet another region where Russian-American differences lead to competition or conflict (such as the recent five-day war in Georgia), which can only benefit the region’s jihadists.6 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">What trends? Simply put, the world has entered a period of great flux and upheaval of uncertain duration. We are witnessing an historic shift in global dynamism from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region, initially in the economic realm, but one that will eventually reorder the geopolitical realm. The middle east – or more broadly the Muslim world – is engaged in an epic battle between tradition and modernization that jeapoardizes global energy sucirty. Although the nation-state, the fundamental unit of the international system since the westphalian peace of 1648, is thrivi ng in East Asia and the United states , it is under mounting strain as Europe seeks to create a supranational structure and artifical states in the Middle East begin to break down along sectarian and ethnic lines. Globalization has fueled an unprecedented period of economic growth around the world while unleashing the forces of disorder – terrorism, transnational crime – and rasing challenges beyond the capacity of inddividual states or current international organizations to manage – global warming, pandemic diseases, proliferation of the materials and know how to build weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). With the economic growth has can a historic transfer of wealth from the West to energy exporters, such as russia, and rising manufacturing powers, such as China. In this uncertain world, the US and russia are not strategic rivals, and neither poses a strategic threat to the other ( despite some overwrought Russian rhetoric to the contrary) , in contrast to the situation during the cold war. Rather, they share a set of common strategic challenges. Russia, by virtue of ite geographic location, and the US, by virtue of its global role, must build new relationships with a Europe that is expanding and deepening; they both must find a way to cope with the growing instability in the middle east, the challenge to energy security that implies, and, at least for Russia, the threat that that instability will infect Russia’s southern reaches ; and they both must manage relations with a rising china. In addition, both countries must deal with the dark side of globalization, and both have a keen interest in the role and effectiveness of the instituions of global governance, such as the UN and G8 the world bank and the IMF. Given their standing as the world’s two leading nuclear powers, the United States and Russia are each Indispensable to dealing with the problems of proliferation of WMDs, nuclear terrorism and strategic stability. The US, as the world’s largest consumer of energy, and Russia, as the largest producer of hydrocarbons, are essential to any discussion of energy security and energy’s future. Global economic dynamics and transfers of wealth will require bringing Russia, along with china, india, and others, into a more central role in managing the global economy, a service long performed by Europe and the United States. In east asia, to create a favorable new equilibirum, Russia has an interest in a strong power – that is, the US – acting as a moderating influence on China, and the US has no interest in a weaking russian presence in Siberia and the Russian far east, regions rich in the natural resources that fuel modern economies. In the Middle East, both the US and russia have levers that could help promote stability, if the two countries were working in concert, or fuel conflict, if they were not. In europe, Russian energy is critical to economic well-being and the US remains essential to security and stability. On a range of other issues – for example, civil nuclear energy, pandemic diseases, climate change – each country is capable of making a major contribution, given the vast scientific talent of each. In the former soviet space, both countries will be critical to building lasting security economic structures. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The hour is late. Leading climate scientists such as James Hansen are literally shouting at the top of their lungs that the world needs to reduce emissions by 20-40% as soon as possible, and 80-90% by the year 2050, if we are to avoid climate chaos, crop failures, endless wars, melting of the polar icecaps, and a disastrous rise in ocean levels. Either we radically reduce CO2 and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e, which includes all GHGs, not just CO2) pollutants (currently at 390 parts per million and rising 2 ppm per year) to 350 ppm, including agriculture-derived methane and nitrous oxide pollution, or else survival for the present and future generations is in jeopardy. As scientists warned at Copenhagen, business as usual and a corresponding 7-8.6 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures means that the carrying capacity of the Earth in 2100 will be reduced to one billion people. Under this hellish scenario, billions will die of thirst, cold, heat, disease, war, and starvation. If the U.S. significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, other countries will follow. One hopeful sign is the recent EPA announcement that it intends to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Unfortunately we are going to have to put tremendous pressure on elected public officials to force the EPA to crack down on GHG polluters (including industrial farms and food processors). Public pressure is especially critical since &quot;just say no&quot; Congressmen-both Democrats and Republicans-along with agribusiness, real estate developers, the construction industry, and the fossil fuel lobby appear determined to maintain &quot;business as usual.&quot; </span><br />

<span class="Underline">After much criticism for appearing to neglect New Delhi while courting Beijing, the Obama administration is now moving to inject a sense of urgency and momentum into US-India relations. But just as bilateral affairs seem to have acquired new dynamism, differences over Afghanistan and Iran threaten to undermine positive developments. There are several factors that explain India’s drop from Washington’s foreign policy priorities. The Obama administration took office viewing Asia’s evolutions differently to the Bush era. And Obama’s prioritising of high profile engagement with Beijing on an array of global governance issues has diverted strategic focus from New Delhi. In an address on US policy in Asia in November 2009, Obama failed to mention India even in passing. The omission was all the more glaring as Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was due in Washington for a state visit a little over a week later. But China’s treatment of Obama during his state visit to Beijing in November 2009 and at the climate summit in Copenhagen a month later has seen the administration revert to Bush-era strategic balancing vis-à-vis China. The Bush administration’s publicly denied but widely understood goal was to build India’s strategic potential as a check against the rise of Chinese power. Is this also the goal of the Obama administration? Undersecretary of state for political affairs, William J. Burns, has affirmed in a recent address that the Obama administration is ‘deeply committed to supporting India’s rise.’ Burns has also called for India’s greater diplomatic and military involvement in East Asia and for enhanced US-Indian defence cooperation; ideas that are bound to irritate leaders in Beijing. A month later, Michele Flournoy, undersecretary of defence for policy, echoed these themes by proclaiming that ‘India’s success is very much in America’s national interest.’ This heightened focus on India increases the likelihood that President Obama’s trip to India will establish new milestones in bilateral relations. But any attempt to strengthen this relationship will not be problem-free. The first of these is Afghanistan. Obama may need to shore up his domestic political base by accelerating the drawdown of US military forces in Afghanistan. This would have obvious implications on Pakistan, and could in turn have serious consequences for US-India relations. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Gates spent the day in the eastern part of the country, where some of the fighting has been the worst. He visited Forward Operating Base Joyce, a remote post in Afghanistan's Kunar province, one of three border-coordination centers where Afghan, Pakistani and U.S. troops are trying to secure the border to make sure that insurgents cannot cross into Pakistan to use that territory as a safe haven. This year we saw something a little bit more challenging. - Army Lt. Col. J.B. Vowell, a commander in Kunar province The safe havens in Pakistan have been a central problem in the eastern part of Afghanistan. The war here is complicated by a porous border that allows insurgents to flee into Pakistan, regroup and come back into Afghanistan to wage attacks. Gates heard from the troops how the safe havens have triggered more violence in Kunar province. &quot;This year we saw something a little bit more challenging. And by that I mean that, come June, we had a 200 percent increase in attacks as compared to the same year 2009 and 2008,&quot; said Lt. Col. J.B. Vowell. Vowell says part of the reason violence is up is because the Pakistani military on the other side of the border has pressured insurgents, and they're being pushed over into Afghanistan where U.S. and Afghan troops engage them. Some military officials refer to it as &quot;stirring up the hornet's nest.&quot; Gates told U.S. soldiers in Kunar that it is working. &quot;We are breaking the momentum of the enemy, and we will reverse that momentum, and we can all go home,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be awhile and we'll suffer tougher losses as we go.&quot; The risk was demonstrated in late November when six U.S. soldiers were shot and killed by an Afghan border police officer during a training mission. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the infiltrator and his attack. &quot;The people don't want us up there, but they don't want the Taliban either. They want to be left alone,&quot; said Maj. Gen. John Campbell, the U.S. commander in charge of 14 provinces in the eastern part of Afghanistan. &quot;So we've got to set the conditions at some point to be able to bring our forces out of there and be able to reposition them to bigger population areas,&quot; he said. Part of the Obama administration's review of the war strategy will look at how resources are allocated — where do U.S. troops help and where is their presence counterproductive? &quot;You really have to take it a district at a time — and maybe even more local areas than that — and diversify your strategy depending on the local conditions, in terms of whether presence contributes to security or detracts from security. And that may differ from one valley to the next,&quot; Gates said. Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said the Taliban still have areas where they can operate freely, but there have also been U.S. gains. &quot;The progress of recent months in particular has been important, because it has demonstrated that we could indeed take away very important areas, areas that mean a great deal to the Taliban,&quot; Petraeus said. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Beyond the noise emanating from the air strikes and guns that surge forces are firing in Kandahar, another surge has occurred over the past year - a surge in the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). Total ANSF growth, starting from November 2009 to present increased from 191,969 to 255,506, an increase of 63,537 (33 percent). The Afghan army has grown from 97,011 to 136,164, an increase of 39,153 (40 percent) and the national police from 94,958 to 117,342, an increase of 22,384 (24 percent). In November 2009, only 35 percent of all soldiers met the minimum qualification standards with their personal weapon. There was an unworkable 1:79 trainers to troop ratio at the firing ranges where Afghan soldiers were attempting to learn. Ten months later, the average unit has a 97 percent qualification rate at the range and the instructor to troop ratio has decreased to 1:29, thanks to increasing support from coalition partners. The quality of the troops may in some way be reflected through public trust. The Afghan Minister of Defense, Abdul Rahim Wardak, mentioned that the Afghan National Police (ANA) is perceived as the most trusted public institution in Afghanistan during a Rehearsal of Concept drill in Kabul in October. According to the results of an Afghan nation-wide survey (sample 6,700), 71 percent of Afghans feel a favorable impression toward the Afghan National Police (ANP) and 74 percent feel favorably towards the ANA. (By comparison, only 23 percent of Americans surveyed in a Gallup poll this month felt favorably towards the U.S. Congress.) Last fall, the daily ISAF training capacity for the ANA was 6,000 seats, resulting in a backlog of the Afghan troops in the pipeline. Today, the ANA daily training capacity has increased to 20,000 seats (up 233 percent) and the ANP training capacity has increased 38 percent, from 7,740 to 10,661 seats. In 2009, there were zero Afghan trainers. Today, there are 1,800 Afghan trainers in the ANA and 800 in the ANP, and those numbers are growing. A critical assumption here is the continued support of coalition trainers. </span><br />

David H. Petraeus were here, he would characterize efforts in the war-torn country to be &quot;slow and steady, but we are making progress.&quot; Addressing Association of the U.S. Army members at its annual meeting here, Brig. Gen. John Nicholson Jr. said that over the last 18 months in Afghanistan, the focus has been on building military and civil capacity. That includes putting 1,000 civilians on the ground while ramping up Afghan Security Forces from 258,000 to 301,000 in addition to the 50,000 U.S. troops who were brought in under the surge. Building the right counterinsurgency institutions with the right leaders, clearing Taliban safe-havens and establishing local police in selected areas are also keys to the counterinsurgency, as is facilitating the reintegration of enemy fighters by convincing them that it's better to sign up and rejoin society than it is to fight the government, Nicholson said. &quot;We're focusing our counterinsurgency efforts on about a third of the districts in the country, primarily focused on the east and the south because that is where the insurgency has its greatest strengths,&quot; he said. &quot;The main efforts are in Kandahar and Helmand provinces with secondary efforts up in the east along the border areas with Pakistan.&quot; The general added that the 50,000 troops brought in were all dispatched to the south with Helmand being primarily a Marine Corps operation while Kandahar and Kabul were Army. He said the coalition's main objective was to secure the major population centers and then enable the Afghan government to connect with the people in those areas to achieve a degree where they buy into the government and then the coalition transitions control and steps back. Nicholson also said that as forces seek to secure population centers, a portion of the force must continue to maintain the initiative against the enemy, most of which is retained by special operations forces which are working at an &quot;unprecedented operational tempo.&quot; &quot;Every 24 hours on average we are killing or capturing three to five mid-level leaders and 24 enemy fighters,&quot; he said. &quot;The affect of this has been multifaceted.

It's lowered the average age of enemy leadership, because they're getting killed so quickly, which is severely disrupting their command and control in country.&quot; He cited an example whereby forces killed a Taliban shadow governor, who they replaced within 72 hours, but he too was also killed. &quot;So this is the kind of optempo that's been maintained against the enemy,&quot; he said. &quot;We are beginning to see anecdotal evidence that this is having an effect on their morale and their cohesion and so forth - obviously this is exactly the kind of pressure we need to maintain on the enemy, which then buys us space and time to secure the population and achieve that connection that we're after between the government and the population.&quot; Nicholson added that the security campaign has entailed a spike in violence which is inevitable. The coalition is presently at the peak of that violence, he said, but added that as governance capability increases and Afghan confidence increases, the violence will begin to go down. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The president will soon announce the deployment of additional U.S. forces to Afghanistan, in a speech likely to emphasize the importance of political progress there. Legitimacy is the most important outcome of a counterinsurgency strategy, not, as some have suggested, an input. It is unfortunate that much of the debate has ignored the role that additional military forces can play in building legitimacy and effective government in a counterinsurgency. Adding forces gives us leverage; military forces are vital to the success of any political strategy because they contribute directly to improving governance as well as to improving security. The recent American experience in Iraq illustrates how U.S. forces and diplomacy helped correct the behaviors of a sometimes malign government in ways that helped neutralize insurgent groups. In early 2007, many Iraqi leaders were using instruments of state to support sectarian death squads. The dysfunctional government could not secure the population, pass laws or provide services to its people. The implementation of a fully resourced counterinsurgency strategy--enabled by the deployment of nearly six additional U.S. combat brigades--transformed Iraq's government within 18 months. Opponents of the surge argued that Iraqis would &quot;step up&quot; politically and militarily only if they knew that U.S. forces would leave. Instead, before committing to the fight, political leaders and populations throughout Iraq assessed whether U.S. forces would stay long enough to secure them. Iraqis stepped up precisely because of the absence of conditionality and time limits on U.S. force levels. If the Afghan government were fully legitimate, there would be no insurgency. U.S. and international actions must aim to improve the Afghan government's ability to provide basic services such as security and dispute resolution nationwide, building the legitimacy of the government in Kabul sufficiently to dampen a large-scale insurgency. They must persuade and even compel Afghan leaders to stop activities that alienate the people and create fertile ground for insurgents. Afghan forces can learn by listening to the exhortations of mentors and by seeing the world's best military perform those tasks. Adding American forces in large numbers would help. It is critical that the Afghan people be provided security. Continuous violence, insurgent intimidation and propaganda campaigns create a pervasive sense of insecurity that undermines the government. As we have seen in Iraq and some parts of Afghanistan, a reduction in violence can slow or stop the erosion of the government's legitimacy. It can also create space in which to resolve underlying tensions that had fueled the violence, through negotiation or the construction of more effective governmental structures, neither of which can occur without security. But American military forces also contribute directly to efforts to improve Afghan institutions. In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, international troops will partner with army and police units. Afghan forces can learn by listening to the exhortations of mentors and by seeing the world's best military perform those tasks. Partnered American units also hinder illegal activities, such as extortion, that Afghan units might otherwise undertake. American military forces can also help restrain politicians' abuses of power. U.S. forces can develop a picture of local power structures, including those through which Afghan officials abuse their power and exacerbate the insurgency. American commanders can collect evidence on individual offenders that a reformed Afghan judicial system would one day be able to use. In the short term, such evidence can be published, embarrassing the official and others involved. Since much of the corruption involves narcotics, the United States and its partners can use international legal mechanisms to pursue Afghan officials in more reliable court systems. We can also threaten to add the worst offenders to our target lists when abuse of power directly supports the enemy. Used systematically, as happened in Iraq, this leverage can dramatically alter the behavior of networks of people misusing their power. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">In &quot;The Ego and the Id,&quot; Freud formulated a seemingly insoluble dilemma in the very essence of the human psyche: the eternal conflict between the dual instincts of eros, the civilizing life instinct, and the indomitable death instinct (thanatos). He also identified some aspects of the death instinct with superego aggression, suggesting that the superego was the agent of the death instinct in its cruel and aggressive need for punishment and that its operative feeling was frequently a punitive hatred, while other aspects of the superego were protective. As we know, Freud thought the source of the superego was the internalization of the castrating Oedipal father. In chapter seven of Civilization and its Discontents, he theorized that when defusion or separation of the dual instincts occurred, aspects of aggression frequently dominated and that it was the purpose of the ego to find objects for eros and/or aggression either in fantasy or reality. The role phantasy plays in projective identification is something to which I shall return. Other theorists, such as Melanie Klein, trace the beginning of the superego back to early (infant) oral phantasies of self-destruction, which is a direct manifestation of the death instinct. Klein transformed the oedipal drama by making the mother its central figure and thus playing a vital role in object-relations theory, [End Page 208] about which I shall say more later in this essay. Although Klein's work relied on the dual instinct theory postulated by Freud, she re-defined the drives by emphasizing the way in which the destructive instincts attached themselves to the object, in particular the good-bad breast. Thus for Klein, the site of the superego is derived from oral incorporation of the good/bad breast, contrary to Freud, for whom the site of the superego is the paternal law. Although the formation of the superego is grounded on the renunciation of loving and hostile Oedipal wishes, it is subsequently refined, by the contributions of social and cultural requirements (education, religion, morality). My argument in this paper is three-fold: (1) These social and cultural requirements in which the superego is grounded may be used by the superego of the state and/or its leader to mobilize aspects of the individual's aggression during war-time in a way that does not happen in peace-time. (2) Klein's theory of splitting and projective identification plays an important role in the concept of difference and otherness as enemy. (3) Bion's development of Klein's theory into what he called the &quot;container&quot; and the &quot;contained&quot; may offer some way out of the psychic dangers of projective identification by suggesting that we may be able to access our internal psychic world as a transformative power to combat violence both internal and external. In an early attempt to define war neuroses, or how war mentally traumatizes the psyche, Freud wrote of the conflict &quot;between the soldier's old peaceful ego and his new warlike one&quot; becoming acute as soon as the peace-ego realizes what danger it runs in losing its own life to the rashness of its newly formed parasitic double&quot; (SE 17 209). Accepting the violence that is within ourselves as well as in the other, the so-called enemy, is a difficult lesson to learn, and learning to displace our instinctual destructive aggression peacefully is enormously more difficult. To the extent the individual superego is connected to society, which assumes its functions particularly in wartime, the problem of war brings into focus the psychoanalytic problem of the partial defusion (separation) of eros and psychic aggression brought about by war through specifically social processes. These social processes involve the mechanisms by which aspects of the violent and aggressive social superego of the State mobilizes and appropriates some of the dynamic aspects of the individual's superego aggression: the need to hate, and to punish, for its own purposes, such as genocide or so-called &quot;ethnic cleansing,&quot; and for territorial and economic reasons. Many of these actions are often masked as defending civilization, or an idealized State and/or its leader. This is also true of the &quot;holy jihads&quot; that are rapidly becoming an enormous threat to the world. In his book Enemies and Allies, Vamik Volkan suggests that the individual may see the superego of the State as his/her own idealized superego. And indeed, this may in turn help to explain how during war-time the social superego is placed in the individual and how in turn the individual is positioned in the social. In Civilization and its Discontents, to which I have already referred, Freud wrote about the ways in which the regulations and demands of a civilized society harbor the risk of the death instinct (aggression) being released at any favorable opportunity, especially when combined with Eros—i. e., under the pretext of idealism and patriotism. This is especially true when there is a leader who elicits strong emotional attachments from a group or nation. Of course, I am not arguing that there are not some important aspects of the social superego that are beneficial, for example the ethical and moral laws which shape society and protect its citizens; nevertheless, in wartime and its most recent manifestation, international terrorism, it is precisely these civilizing aspects of the social superego that are ignored or repressed. It seems to me that the failure of civilization historically to control the aggression, cruelty, and hatred that characterize war urgently requires a psychoanalytic explanation. Of course, I am speaking of psychic, not biological (survival of the fittest), aggression. In wartime the externalized superego of the state sanctions killing and violence that is not allowed in peacetime (in fact, such violence against others during peacetime would be considered criminal)—sanctions, in fact, the gratification of warring aggression, thus ensuring that acts of violence need not incur guilt. Why do we accept this? Psychoanalysis posits the idea that aggression is not behavioral but instinctual; not social but psychological. To quote Volkan, who follows Freud, &quot;It is man's very nature itself.&quot; Obviously, it is [End Page 209] vital that humanity find more mature, less primitive ways of dealing with our hatred and aggression than war, genocide, and international terrorism. The most characteristic thing about this kind of violence and cruelty is its collective mentality: war requires group co-operation, organization, and approval. Some theorists argue that one of the primary cohesive elements binding individuals into institutionalized human association is defence against psychotic anxiety. In Group Psychology Freud writes that &quot;in a group the individual is brought under conditions which allow him to throw off the repressions of his unconscious instinctual impulses. The apparently new characteristics he then displays are in fact the manifestation of this unconscious, in which all that is evil in the human mind is contained as a predisposition&quot; (74). Later in the same essay, when speaking of the individual and the group mind, Freud quotes Le Bon : &quot;Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian—that is, a creature acting by instinct. He posseses the spontaneity, the violence, the ferocity, and also the enthusiasm and heroism of primitive beings&quot; (77). War is a collective phenomenon that mobilizes our anxieties and allows our original sadistic fantasies of destructive omnipotence to be re-activated and projected onto &quot;the enemy.&quot; Some critics have argued that we &quot;need&quot; enemies as external stabilizers of our sense of identity and inner control. It has also been argued that the militancy a particular group shows toward its enemies may partly mask the personal internal conflicts of each member of the group, and that they may therefore have an emotional investment in the maintenance of the enmity. In other words, they need the enemy and are unconsciously afraid to lose it. This fits in with the well known phenomenon of inventing an enemy when there is not one readily available. The individual suicide bomber, or suicide pilot, is just as much part of this group psychology—each bomber, each terrorist, is acting for her/his group, or even more immediately his or her family, from whom she/he derives enormous psychic strength and support. Just as importantly, she/he is acting in the name of her/his leader. All of these identifications require strong emotional attachments. Freud writes, &quot;The mutual tie between members of a group is in the nature of an identification, based upon an important emotional common quality. . . . This common quality lies in the nature of the tie to the leader&quot; (Group 107-8). In Learning from Experience, Bion theorizes that a social group functions to establish a fixed social order of things (the establishment), and that the individual has to be contained by the establishment of the group. Sometimes the rigidity of the system crushes the individual's creativity; alternatively, certain special individuals erupt in the group, which goes to pieces under their influence (Bion cites Jesus within the constraints of Israel). A final possibility is the mutual adaptation of one to the other, with a development of both the individual and the group. The development of a sense of self, its integration, its separation, and its protection all begin, of course, in early childhood. Psychoanalysts like Klein, Winnicott, and Bion have explored these ideas in what is known as object relations theory. Volkan writes that the concepts of enemy and ally and the senses of ethnicity and nationality are largely bound up with the individual's sense of self, and that individuals within an ethnic or national group tend to see their group as a privileged &quot;pseudo-species&quot; (Erikson) and enemy groups as subhuman (262). </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The central idea here-and I believe it is also Broyles' and Daniell's main point-is that none of this is unusual. Not far below the surface in each of us are impulses of hatred and violence which can be aroused with a minimum of provocation. We may need only an opportunity to avenge some real or imagined hurt, the right political or military conditions and supporting ideology, and a properly designated enemy, so that we may participate, actively or passively, in killing without responsibility or guilt. It may be that the ultimate or deepest source of aggression resides in one or another earlier experience of hurt and humiliation. But if so, such pain seems to serve as a vast reservoir of soul-injury in our species, which, like volcanic lava, may erupt under the most unpredictable of circumstances. And, like the lava in the earth's center, a strategy aimed at removing it would be absurd. I have stressed this dark, violent side of our natures because I believe more 225 effort to understand its role in political life, especially in the conduct of international relations, needs to be undertaken if we are to order more effectively our collective life. There are many uncertainties confronting the social sciences regarding the relationship between individual and large group psychology, a problem that also intrigues Stanley Hoffmann (Freud, 1921, 1930 (1929); Mack, 1983; Hoffmann, 1986). &quot;Do we really know,&quot; he asks, &quot;how individuals who are dispersed, who live in different places and groups, produce a sort of collective mind, mood, and pattern of conduct that may be quite independent of, and often contrary to their character and behavior as individuals?&quot; The poet Robert Bly (Jones, 1985) has conceived of the psychological life of the nation not just as &quot;something deep inside our psyche, but as a psyche larger than the psyche of anyone living, a larger sphere, floating above everyone&quot; (p. 133). Rushdie (1984) has imagined collective violence itself, born of the cycles of a people's individual and group humiliation, as &quot;something more like a principle, the embodiment of violence, the pure malevolent strength of the Beast&quot; (p. 268). What is not uncertain is that there is a special relationship between human group life and the dark, aggressive side of man's nature. Whatever the ultimate judgment of history about the justice of, or justification for, one or another war, national leaders, both in democratic and totalitarian societies, know well how to mobilize not only the millions of Broyles's and Zanes who serve in the military, but also most of the rest of us as well. As Hitler understood uncannily, &quot;the art of all truly great national leaders&quot; lies in &quot;keeping the attention of a people concentrated upon a single foe&quot; (1925, p. 118). Many national leaders know well how to play on the hurt pride, and the experiences of frustration and humiliation among the members of a society, in arousing public opinion. One of the principal difficulties in applying psychology to human group life is, as Hoffmann points out, the sorting of objective or &quot;concrete realities&quot; from the distorted image of the enemy created by ignorance and hatred. The enemy is always, to a degree, &quot;real.&quot; But he (or she) is also the product of our darkest selves. The nation state serves many important functions for individuals. It provides a sense of belonging and value, difficult to achieve in the modem world, and is expected to protect personal survival. As historian Karl Deutsch (1985) recently said &quot;the nation state is the only instrument to get things done&quot; in the moder world. At the same time a national group or state may permit or encourage acts of aggression in its service which individuals would never commit or tolerate morally on their own. Broyles describes how G.I.'s desecrated the body of a dead North Vietnamese soldier, including placing a large piece of feces on his head. In Beirut I was told by a Christian woman whose apartment w s raided by Palestinian soldiers that they left feces in her refrigerator. The term &quot;dehumanize&quot; is often used to describe the extreme devaluation of a designated enemy that allows acts like these or the killing of whole peoples. Yet valuable as this term may be, it seems also important to discover if there are sources of intolerable self-hatred which impel human national groups to apply extreme, debasing designations to other such groups. It is perhaps an oversimplification to link psychologically the retaliating and raiding by primitive tribes for defense, dominance, revenge, and competition over scarce resources, with the propensity to large-scale killing of modem imperial states. Yet many of the ingredients are similar. Consider the calls for massive vengeance last June when Shiite Moslems hijacked a TWA jetliner, killed a marine, and held 40 Americans hostage. A syndicated columnist suggested threatening to kill 10 Shiite prisoners for each American killed. &quot;Make no mistake,&quot; he wrote, &quot;We find ourselves in a virtual state of war. War is inherently cruel. During World War II, the Germans indiscriminately bombed targets in England; the allies retaliated with saturation bombing of German cities&quot; (Kilpatrick, 1985). An editorial director of a Boston radio station in the CBS network broadcast eight times in 2 days his plea for massive retaliation. &quot;War is waged against a nation, not against select individuals,&quot; he said. &quot;We must hold responsible and retaliate against not only the terrorists but also the supporters, state or cause which they serve or which aid them. .. . Such a policy may cause loss of life in the Shiite community, Iran, and other Arab countries. But innocent people are being killed now&quot; (Nelson, 1985). More recently we witnessed an outpouring of &quot;cries for blood&quot; (Freedman, 1985) following the capture of four Palestinian hijackers who had killed an American aboard the Italian Cruise ship Achille Lauro. Extreme nationalism and the defensive blinders which accompany its intense emotions (Mack, 1983) enable ethnonational groups to indulge in the satisfactions of revenge without needing to attend to the political grievances of other desperate peoples, or to take responsibility for large scale killing committed by one's own government or its allies. The opportunities for committing genocide have been greatly expanded by modem technological inventions, which, at the same time, have provided ways of distancing ourselves from the emotional realities of large-scale death. Through the communication media, especially television, the emotions of whole nations can quickly be aroused. Yet the human roots of mass violence and killing remain to be understood and better managed. I have dwelled at some length upon these unsavory aspects of the psychology of peace and war, not because they necessarily determine the daily, intricate play by play of international politics but because I suspect that unless these darker forces are considered more fully, the unruly elements and habits that seem to dominate humankind's group life will subvert our analysis and therapy alike. Withoutm ore attentiont o this dimension we cannot understandt he popularityo f Adolph Hitler in Germany or of Meir Kahane in Israel. Psychoanalytic psychology, as Stephen Spender (Jones, 1985) said of poetry, &quot;penetrates into the depths of an external situation and shows what is strange and terrible&quot; (p. 68). But here a special problem arises. If the purpose of depth psychology in individual work is to foster self-awareness in order to help a person assume greater responsibility for his own life, by what means do we bring about at a societal level understanding of one's own nation's contribution to a particular internationacl onflict? It seems to be in the natureo f societies, as RobertB ly has written, &quot;to kill awareness&quot; (Jones, p. 131). Evil is readily located in other societal systems, but it seems to be emotionally intolerable to discover it in one's own. We are quickly aroused to seek vengeance when Americans are killed or captured overseas, but nationalistic defenses guard us from outrage when our battleships shell innocent villages in the Lebanese hills to mitigate the humiliation of withdrawing our marines from Beirut or Israeli bombers kill civilians in Tunis in the war against the PLO, Salman Rushdie (1984) writes, &quot;What-mustonno-account-be-known&quot; is the &quot;impossible verity that barbarism could grow in cultured soil, that savagery could be concealed beneath decency's wellpressed shirt&quot; (p. 219). Whether we work in government, in weapons laboratories, university seminar rooms or psychiatric offices, all of us wear such wellpressed shirts. I have said little so far about the nuclear reality, or claimed that the habits of our collective emotional life described above are, by themselves, &quot;irrational.&quot; Ethnic violence, war, even genocide may be unfortunate, destructive, or consummately evil from the standpoint of the victims, but are not necessarily irrational if they serve agreed upon national interests. But the nuclear situation has changed all that. As psychologist James Blight (1985) has written, &quot;An American president, contemplating nuclear war and its avoidance in any concrete situation must face new facts, horribly frightening facts, unalterable facts, which before did not come into play&quot; (p. 3). What Blight is referring to, of course, is the probability that a nuclear war will fail to serve any national interest, as it is likely to destroy the attacker's own nation. It is in the context of this nonadaptability of nuclear weapons to specific national and military aims and purposes that the collective forces described in this article become irrational. The aggressiveness of nations can now, as the American Catholic Bishops have told us, destroy God's work. James Agee (1945), but 2 weeks after an atomic bomb was detonated over Hiroshima, wrote that the demonstration of this new power against living creatures &quot;created a bottomless wound in the living conscience of the human race.&quot; The wound has deepened and we are unable to fathom it. But we can try, however disturbing the confrontation, to come to terms with what the reality of nuclear war might actually be. To do so might contribute to &quot;an end to nuclear strategy,&quot; as Robert McNamara called for as early as 1963 (Blight, 1985). &quot;What would it be like to go to nuclear war?&quot; Blight (1986a) has asked. He offers his own answer: &quot;It would be like entering an unfathomably deadly insane asylum&quot; (p. 32). This is not to say that we do not continue to live by the habits of nationalism, ideology, international and national politics along the lines that Hoffmann describes (1986). But there is an elemental difference now. The context is irradicably altered, for the stakes are infinite. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">Our capacity for splitting and projection plays an important part in how we see others and feel about others, and through the process of projective identification, how we make others feel about ourselves and themselves. Projective identification involves a deep split, displacing onto and into others the hateful, bad parts of ourselves, and frequently making them feel hateful to themselves through their own introjection of our hatred. This hatred is often racial or religious, frequently both. Moreover, in the process of projective identification, parts of the self are put into the other, thus depleting the ego. (This process can be a vicious circle, and it is a profoundly disturbing and characteristic pathology, often involving envy and/or rivalry, [End Page 210] both corrosive, poisonous forces.) These Kleinian ideas, developed by other theorists, such as Winnicott and Bion, are hugely relevant to the problem of war and genocide, and most recently, of terrorism. Klein argues that in the paranoid schizoid position there is a splitting of good and bad objects, with the good being introjected and the bad being externalized and projected out into someone or onto something else. As with the infant and child, so with the adult, mechanisms of splitting and projection play upon negative and feared connotations of the other, of the enemy, and of difference; projection prevents warring nations from exploring and thus understanding what it is that actually divides them; it prevents mutual response and recognition by promoting exclusivity. As already mentioned, analysts such as Volkan and Erikson have written about the processes by which an enemy is dehumanized so as to provide the distance a group needs from its perceived enemy. First the group becomes preoccupied with the enemy according to the psychology of minor differences. Then mass regression occurs to permit the group to recover and reactivate more primitive methods. What they then use in this regressed state tends to contain aspects of childish (pre-oedipal) fury. The enemy is perceived more and more as a stereotype of bad and negative qualities. The use of denial allows a group to ignore the fact that its own externalizations and projections are involved in this process. The stereotyped enemy may be so despised as to be no longer human, and it will then be referred to in non-human terms. History teaches us that it was in this way that the Nazis perceived the Jews as vermin to be exterminated. As I write, Al Qaeda terrorist groups view all Americans as demons and infidels to be annihilated, and many Americans are comforted by demonizing all of bearded Islam. Many Israelis consider most Palestinians as dirt beneath their feet—sub-human—and most Palestinians think of most Israelis as despoilers of the land they are supposed to share. In other words, the problem of the mentality of war and of terrorism mobilizes our anxieties in such a way so as to prevent critical reality testing. If we could learn the enormously difficult and painful task of re-introjection, of taking back our projections, our hatreds, anxieties, and fears of the other and of difference, long before they harm the other, there might be a transition, a link, from the state sanctioned violence of war back to individual violence. We might learn to subvert negative projective identification into a positive identification as a means of empathizing with the other and thus containing difference. The violence of the individual could then be contained and sublimated in peaceful ways, such as reconciling and balancing competing interests by asking what exactly these opposing interests are and exploring what the dynamics, conscious and unconscious, are for the hatred of deep war-like antagonisms. In other words, we would need to change our relationship with the other, giving up the dangerously irresponsible habit of splitting, projective identification, and exclusivity by recognizing difference not antagonistically but through an inclusive process that recognises the totality of human relationships in a peaceful world. We might substitute for the libidinal object-ties involved in projective identification the re-introjection of the object into the ego, and thus reach a common feeling of sharing, of being part of the other, of empathy, in short. As Freud pointed out, the ego is altered by introjection, as suggested by his memorable formulation: &quot;The shadow of the object has fallen on the ego.&quot; In his book Second Thoughts, Bion theorizes that in the infant as in the adult, re-introjection can be dangerous if the dominance of projective identification confuses the distinction between self and the external object, since this awareness depends on the recognition of a distinction between subject and object. But Bion's theory of the pairing group, of the container and the contained, provides a way out of this predicament, suggesting that the outcome of such pairing is either detrimental to the contained, or to the container, or mutually developing to both. This idea is germane to my argument in this paper that the reciprocity of the container and the contained relationship, through both positive projective identification (empathy) and introjection or re-introjection, results in a positive allowance of difference—in other words, a healthy acceptance of and adaptation to the other within the self and the self within the other. It is here of course that language plays an important role in imagining the other, the other within the self, and the other as self, as well as the enormously influential visual images each group can have of the other. In the need to emphasize similarity in difference, [End Page 211] both verbal and visual metaphor can play a meaningful role in creating a climate for peaceful understanding, and this is where literature, especially the social world of the drama and of film, but also the more private world of poetry, can be immensely significant. Of course not all literature is equally transparent. In conclusion, war, in all its manifestations, is a phenomenon put into action by individuals who have been politicized as a group to give and receive violent death, to appropriate the enemy's land, homes, women, children, and goods, and perhaps to lose their own. As we have seen, in wartime the splitting of the self and other into friend and enemy enormously relieves the normal psychic tension caused by human ambivalence when love and hate find two separate objects of attention. Hence the soldier's and terrorist's willingness to sacrifice her/his life for &quot;a just cause,&quot; which may be a Nation, a Group, or a Leader with whom he has close emotional ties and identity. In this way s/he does not feel guilty: the destructive impulses, mobilised by her/his own superego, together with that of the social superego, have projected the guilt s/he might feel at killing strangers onto the enemy. In other words, the charging of the enemy with guilt by which the superego of the State mobilizes the individual's superego seems to be of fundamental importance in escaping the sense of guilt which war provokes in those engaged in the killing; yet the mobilization of superego activities can still involve the individual's self-punitive mechanisms, even though most of his/her guilt has been projected onto the enemy in the name of his own civilization and culture. As we all know, this guilt can become a problem at the end of a war, leading to varying degrees of misery and mental illness. For some, the killing of an enemy and a stranger cannot be truly mourned, and there remains a blank space, an irretrievable act or event to be lived through over and over again. This dilemma is poignantly expressed in Wilfred Owen's World War One poem &quot;Strange Meeting,&quot;the final lines of which read as follows: I am the enemy you killed, my friend. I knew you in this dark: for so you frowned Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed. I parried; but my hands were loath and cold. Let us sleep now. . . . (Owen 126) The problem for us today is how to create the psychological climate of opinion, a mentality, that will reject war, genocide, and terrorism as viable solutions to internal and external situations of conflict; to recognize our projections for what they are—dangerously irresponsible psychic acts based on superego hatred and violence. We must challenge the way in which the State superego can manipulate our responses in its own interests, even take away our subjectivities. We should acknowledge and learn to displace the violence in ourselves in socially harmless ways, getting rid of our fears and anxieties of the other and of difference by relating and identifying with the other and thus creating the serious desire to live together in a peaceful world. What seems to be needed is for the superego to regain its developmental role of mitigating omniscient projective identification by ensuring an intact, integrated object world, a world that will be able to contain unconscious fears, hatred, and anxieties without the need for splitting and projection. As Bion has pointed out, omnipotence replaces thinking and omniscience replaces learning. We must learn to link our internal and external worlds so as to act as a container of the other's fears and anxieties, and thus in turn to encourage the other to reciprocate as a container of our hatreds and fears. If war represents cultural formations that in turn represent objectifications of the psyche via the superego of the individual and of the State, then perhaps we can reformulate these psychic social mechanisms of projection and superego aggression. Here, that old peace-time ego and the reparative component of the individual and State superego will have to play a large part. The greater the clash of cultural formations—for example, Western Modernism and Islamic Fundamentalism—the more urgent the need. &quot;The knowledge now most worth having&quot; is an authentic way of internalizing what it is we understand about war and international terrorism that will liberate us from the history of our collective traumatic past and the imperatives it has imposed on us. The inner psychic world of the individual has an enormously important adaptive role to play here in developing mechanisms of projective identification not as a means of damaging and destroying the other, but as a means of empathy, of containing the other, and in turn being contained. Furthermore, we should learn not to project too [End Page 212] much into our group, and our nation, for this allows the group to tyrannize us, so that we follow like lost sheep. But speaking our minds takes courage because groups do not like open dissenters. These radical psychic changes may be evolutionary rather than revolutionary, gradual rather than speedy; however, my proposition that understanding the other so that we can reduce her/his motivation to kill requires urgent action. Peace is are not just an absence of war, but a state of mind—and, most importantly, a way of thinking. </span><br />

For practical purposes, psychopolitical dialogues are a series of intensive workshops during which the facilitating team brings into the open previously unrecognized thoughts and feelings and helps the participants work through them. The goal is </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to prevent</span> these <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">disturbing thoughts</span> and feelings <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">from remaining in the shadows</span> and interfering with a realistic evaluation of and relationship with the &quot;enemy&quot;.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> In this sense, the workshops are therapeutic, but not at the level of personal problems. Since they deal with conflicts pertaining to participants' large-group identity, images of the enemy group, and historical grievances, they are primarily in the service of removing psychopolitical obstacles experienced by participants from opposing large groups. </span><u>Psychopolitical dialogues become a process <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">where historical grievances are aired</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">; perceptions, fears, and attitudes are articulated; and previously hidden psychological obstacles to reconciliation or change rise to the surface. </span><u>Their aim is not to erase the images of past historical events and differences in large-group identity</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and culture, </span><u>but</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> rather </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to detoxify the relationship so</span> that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">differences do not lead to renewed violence</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. When two large groups are in conflict, the enemy is obviously real, but it is also fantasized. </span><u>If participants can differentiate their fantasized dangers</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> from the current issues, </span><u>then negotiations and steps towards peace can become more realistic.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">To be effective on a long-term basis, the series of </span><u>psychopolitical workshops calls for the same 30 to 40 influential participants</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (legislators, ambassadors, government officials, well-known scholars, or other public figures) </span><u>to meet two to three times per year for three to four days each time</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. During the workshops, there are plenary sessions, but most of the work is done in small groups led by members of the facilitating interdisciplinary team. </span><u>The <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">participants</span> from the opposing large groups <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">become spokespersons for their</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> ethnic or national </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">groups</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, and the facilitating team seeks </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to spread</span> the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">insights</span> gained to the broader population through concrete programmes <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that <strong>promote peaceful strategies and co-existence.</strong></span></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">If psychopolitical dialogues are to succeed and have any impact on a society, </span><u>the facilitating team must earn the trust of the participants from both sides</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. In order for the gained insights to have an impact on social and political policy as well as on the populace at large, the final phase requires the collaborative development of concrete actions, programmes, and institutions. </span><u>What is learned is oper-ationalized so that more peaceful co-existence can be achieved.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">In this brief chapter I will not provide details of the Tree Model. The reader can find such details elsewhere (Volkan, 1999, 2006). It will be sufficient to state that this methodology, especially during the psychopolitical dialogues, pays full attention to large-group psychology topics described in this chapter. </span><u>It takes into consideration the importance of threats</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">against large-group identity, it </span><u>notices the importance of the shared mental representation of the large-groups' histories, and</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> includes the impact of </span><u>transgenerational transmission of trauma</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, chosen glories, chosen traumas, as well as the time collapse. </span><u>One</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> crucial </span><u>aim</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">of the psychopolitical dialogues </span><u>is to establish a &quot;time expansion&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> between the more recent problems and the past ones belonging to the ancestors </span><u>so</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that </span><u>more realistic negotiations</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> about current issues </span><u>can take place</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. This is done by not forgetting or denying ancestors' traumas but by understanding and feeling how the mental representations of such traumas have become large-group identity markers. Political and diplomatic efforts to find peaceful co-existence between enemies provoke shared, felt or hidden anxiety, and therefore shared psychological obstacles against peaceful solutions because they threaten existing large-group identities, despite the fact that at times the population may appear to favour such changes. As a way of handling the opposing large groups' anxiety, the facilitating team pays attention to tzvo basic principle's that govern the interactions between enemies. These two principles are: 1. Two opposing large groups need to maintain their identities as distinct from each other (principle of non-sameness) and 2. Two opposing large groups need to maintain an unambiguous psychological border between them. If a political border exists between the enemies, it becomes highly psychological. Both principles relate to the fact that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">people</span> in one large group <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have a tendency to externalize</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, project, and displace certain </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">unwanted elements onto the other</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Imagine &quot;mud&quot; is thrown onto the &quot;other's&quot; huge tent's canvas, and it sometimes leaves a &quot;stain&quot;. There is, however, also anxiety that the &quot;mud&quot; could be hurled right back at the sender. The two principles exist to prevent the &quot;mud&quot; from coming back, thus helping each side's identity remain cohesive. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The act of paying attention to differences, including minor ones</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, between two large groups in conflict </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">can be seen as a way of shoring up the psychological border</span> between the</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> two large groups' </span><u>identities</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. This differentiation helps lessen each group's anxiety, since, with the border in place, a clear distinction between the two large groups is maintained, diminishing the anxiety that one large group's identity will become diluted or lost in the other's. </span><u>This emphasis differentiates this facilitating team's strategy from many other peace-making persons' or teams' insistence that in order to make peace the opposing groups are required to be friendly and that enemies need to &quot;love&quot; each other in order to make peace.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">When two opposing groups perceive threats against their large-group identities, minor differences (Freud, 1917, 1921; Volkan, 1988, 1997, 2006) between them assume increasing psychological importance. Many symbols that mark large-group identities have been involved in accentuating minor differences. For example, the inhabitants of Andhra Pradesh in India often wear scarves around their necks, whereas members of the neighbouring group with whom they sometimes fight, the Telanganas, do not. Between Croats and Serbs, dialect differences—such as the Croat mlijeko (milk) vs. the Serb mlcko—carry a heavy political-cultural load. In times of stress and violent outbreaks, identifying minor differences may have deadly implications. Sinhalese mobs in the Sri Lankan riots of 1958, for example, relied on a variety of subtle indicators—such as the presence of earring holes in the ear or the manner in which a shirt was worn—to identify their enemy Tamils, whom they then attacked or killed (Horowitz, 1985). During the application of the Tree Model </span><u>the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">participants from</span> the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">opposing</span> large <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">groups may</span> suddenly <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">experience</span> a <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">rapprochement</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> This closeness is then </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">followed by</span> a sudden <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">withdrawal</span></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">from one another </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and then</span> again by <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">closeness</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">—coming together and then pulling apart like an accordion. </span><u>Denying and accepting derivatives of aggression</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> within the participants towards the &quot;enemy&quot; large group, even when they are hidden, and attempts to protect large-group identities </span><u>underlie this behaviour</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Effective discussion of real-world issues cannot take place unless one allows the &quot;accordion playing&quot; to continue for a while so that the swing in sentiments can be replaced by more secure feelings about participants' large-group identities. </span><u>Clinical <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">psychoanalysis provides us with models to apply towards establishing a psychoanalytically informed methodology for finding peaceful solutions</span> between enemies</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Consider, for example, an individual with a very traumatic childhood. He comes to analysis as an adult with defences against shame and humiliation, murderous rage, and a need to be understood and accepted as a human being by fellow human beings. </span><u>After a while this person</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, during his sessions, </span><u>gives up his defences and adaptation to his internal conflicts</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The analyst becomes a transference figure and the patient experiences the analyst as some important figure from his childhood, such as a person on whom the patient depends and for whom he experiences rage. Such developments are part of analytic treatment, and for it to work properly, a &quot;therapeutic space&quot; has to be formed and maintained in the analyst's office. Let us visualize such a space with an imagined effigy representing the analyst sitting in the middle of it. The patient sends verbal missiles to mutilate and kill the effigy and the analyst tolerates the attack. The next day, the analyst-effigy is placed in the therapeutic space again, showing the patient that his childhood rage did not commit a murder. A mental &quot;game&quot; is played in this space until the patient learns how to &quot;kiJl&quot; a symbol and not a real person, how to relinquish devastating guilt feelings, how to tame other intense emotions, and how to separate fantasy from reality. The patient also learns to establish a firm continuity of time, but with an ability to restore feelings, thinking, and perceptions to their proper places: the past, the present, or the future. In other words, the burdens of the past can be left behind, and a hope for a better future can be maintained. There should be no damaging intrusions into this space. For example, the patient does not really hit the analyst, but only his or her effigy, and the analyst does not have real sex with the patient who wishes to be loved, but only shows the patient that the latter is &quot;loved&quot; because the analyst has always protected the therapeutic space. </span><u>The Tree Model aims to create such a &quot;therapeutic space&quot; between warring enemy large groups where they can &quot;play&quot; a serious and deadly game while always killing the effigies rather than one another</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. This is of course very difficult and perhaps impossible to establish if enemy groups constantly invade this space with real bullets, missiles, torture, and live bombs—like suicide bombers. However, our experiences with this model have shown us that it works in situations when wars are over or when international conflict has become chronic. I also believe that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">some of the</span> Tree Model <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">principles</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, especially those connected with the large-group psychology pertaining to large-group identity, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">can be and sometimes should be considered even when the conflict is &quot;hot&quot;</span> and deadly</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.

There is a LOT of anger going on. Many times it is inappropriately acted upon. </span><u>Islamists are angry, so they blow up people. Conservatives are angry so they advocate indiscriminate</u> <u>retaliation</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><u>Liberals are angry so they advocate undermining the war</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. All </span><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this anger is misdirected</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. We can see how the killing of innocents is wrong, but </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">sometimes we cannot see how allowing innocents to be killed is wrong</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. One should seriously consider the impacts of certain types of dissention in this country before embarking on said dissentious course. I have many issues with the war in Iraq, but I will focus on just a couple. When President </span><u>Bush</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> pronounced to the world that he would defeat terrorism, he </span><u>made a promise</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. He promised </span><u>that he would not only pursue</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">the </span><u>terrorists</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> wherever they may be, </span><u>but</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">he promised to </span><u>go after</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the countri</span><u>es that enable those terrorists</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. When the UN made resolution after resolution against Iraq those too were promises. The difference comes in whether one follows up a promise or not. You see, no one embarks on a major undertaking with the expectation of losing. The choices any person or group are almost always predicated on the fact that the reward exceeds the price or risk. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Hitler would not have invaded Czechoslovakia unless he thought he could get away with it</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 6pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> He would not have invaded Poland unless he though he could get away with it. The </span><u>success of those events and reaction of Europe convinced him that he could press on</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and take all of Europe. </span><u>Saddam would not have invaded Kuwait unless he thought he could get away with it</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. He would not have defied the UN unless he though he could get away with it. </span><u>In those cases, the acting party decided that they could attain their goals using the methods employed. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The same thing goes for the terrorists</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. They methods they employ are based on the expectation of ultimate success. The methods they employ are also based on their own capabilities, capabilities that stem from the support of governments both passive and active, the support of moneyed benefactors, and the support of powerful influencers such as media and high profile personalities. This brings me back to promises made. Part of </span><u>the reason these terrorists became</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> so </span><u>bold is that there were few</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> significant </span><u>reprisals</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> for their actions. In the same way Hitler moved on Poland and Hussein defied the UN, Al Qaeda flew planes into our buildings. Ultimately it was because they could and that the reprisals had insufficient deterrent effect. Now, when President Bush announced that he would pursue the nations that supported terrorism, he basically set the stage for action. The choice was, rattle the saber and hope it is enough, or draw the saber and demonstrate our commitment to living up to our promises. It is fair to debate whether Iraq was the best choice for an operation, but the stage had also been set there as well. With promises being made at the UN, the choice was to continue to prove that promises meant nothing or to prove that they did. I believe that the lack of consequences in the past was a key factor in the terrorist activity leading up to and including 9/11. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Without</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">resolve</span> to back up</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> our </span><u>promises, our <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">enemies will be emboldened</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to act. It does not get any simpler than that. Iraq was a promise kept. Now, some </span><u>people want us to renege</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> on that promise and others. </span><u>That is</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> a </span><strong><u>dangerous</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> position to be advocating. The thing is, the debate about Iraq belongs BEFORE we took action. And that debate DID occur. It occurred BEFORE the war. And the result was overwhelmingly in FAVOR of action. The congress granted President Bush the authority to act. The fact that they did not like his decision is moot. If they did not trust his ability to act, they were wrong to have given him the authority to do so. NOW they are wrong for challenging his decision after the fact. That brings us back to the concept of one's expectation of the results of one's actions. In many cases throughout history, the winner of a conflict was not always the one with the bigger army, the better equipment, and the best trained, or any of those factors. The winner quite often was the one with the greater will to win. </span><u>Wars are won by will in far greater weight then in anything else</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. I would say that </span><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">will is THE determining factor in success</span> in any conflict</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Obviously will is not enough. A greater force can sap the will of another army, but not always. The revolutionary war was won by will, not by military might. Vietnam was lost by will not by military might. And, Iraq will be won or lost by will alone. The consequences of this outcome will have long lasting impacts on the security of our nation. At this point, it does not matter whether we should have gone into Iraq. The fact is we are there now. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">We either complete the job</span></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">and fulfill our promises to rebuild that nation and leave it with a stable and free society </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">or</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> we </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">cut and run and have the world know</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> with certainty that our word is null and void and that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">we have no resolve</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. That is the stakes. That is the goal of the terrorists: to prove they have resolve, to prove that we do not. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Their victory will ensure increased attacks</span> on</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">all </span><u>nations because</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><u>terrorists</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> will </span><u>have</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> unimpeachable </span><u>proof</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that </span><u>their tactics will</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> ultimately </span><u>succeed</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Bombings, beheadings, gross atrocities will be the weapons of choice in the future. Tactics that have been proven to bring down the mighty. If will is the factor that determines the outcome, then </span><u>will is the place where we must consider here and now</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. As far as our enemy is concerned, we MUST make them believe that they cannot succeed. We MUST make them sure that WE will prevail. </span><u>We MUST prove</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to them that </span><u>their tactics are ineffectual.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> There is a down side to that. Once an enemy realizes their tactics are not succeeding, they will change them. With an enemy of this nature, that could result in greater atrocities than we have yet seen. Yet, even then we must prevail. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">We must</span> continue to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">demonstrate</span> OUR <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">resolve and</span></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">OUR </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">willingness</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to see this to the end </span><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and DEFEAT them</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Since </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">they</span> have <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">shown little regard for</span> decency and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">life</span>,</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">since they have shown that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">our</span> very <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">existence is provocation</span> to them, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">no</span> amount of diplomacy or <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">concessions will</span></u> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">achieve an end satisfactory</span></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">to our nation. The only solution is the demonstration of our willingness to defeat them despite their tactics. Our goal is to defeat the will of the enemy. His goal is to defeat ours. </span><u>Any indication that the enemy's will is faltering will bolster our own will.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">However, </span><u>the opposite is true as well.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Any indication that our will is faltering will embolden the enemy's will. Unfortunately, from the very first minute of this conflict, parts of our country have shouted from the very mountain tops just how little will they have to win the war. They demonstrate clearly for our enemies that we don't want to fight. They give clear indication that enemy tactics are successful. In effect, they give aid and comfort to the enemy and spur them on to continued fighting because they tell the enemy in clear messages that if they continue in their tactics, the United States will be defeated. As I said before, </span><u>the debate about whether we go to war is over. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">We are now at war</span>, and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the ONLY debate we should have is</span> on <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">what tactics are most appropriate</span> for prosecuting that war</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. It is marginally fair to state that you are unhappy about our decision to go to war, but beyond that, anything else will embolden the enemy. Think very long and about what is at stake here. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to be pro America while actively dissenting on ongoing conflict. It is bordering on treason for a public official to undermine the war effort, the Commander in Chief and the military publicly for all the world to see. We have started down this path, and there are but two choices: to win or to lose. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">There is no &quot;suing for peace&quot;</span> with this enemy</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Now, that does not mean you have to become militaristic and be a war monger. </span><u>You can be a peacenik, but you need to consider that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">unless you want to see the U</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">harmed, you should cease criticism</span></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">of the war itself until after it is won.

<u>A</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> grand strategy based on American primacy means ensuring the United States stays the world's number one power the diplomatic, economic and military leader. </span><u>Those arguing against primacy claim</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that the United States should retrench, ei¬ther because </span><u>the U</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span><u>lacks</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">the </span><u>power to maintain</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> its </span><u>primacy and should withdraw</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> from its global commitments, or </span><u>because</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the </span><u>maintenance</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of primacy </span><u>will lead</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the United States in</span><u>to</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the trap of &quot;</span><u>imperial overstretch</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.&quot; In the previous issue of The National Interest, Christopher Layne warned of these dangers of pri¬macy and called for retrenchment.1 Those arguing for a grand strategy of retrenchment are a diverse lot. They include isolationists, who want no foreign military commitments; selective engagers, who want U.S. military commitments to centers of economic might; and offshore balancers, who want a modified form of selective engagement that would have the United States abandon its landpower presence abroad in favor of relying on airpower and seapower to defend its in¬terests. But </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">retrenchment</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, in any of its guis¬es, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">must be avoided</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. If the United States adopted such a strategy, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it</span> would be a profound</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> strategic </span><u>mistake that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">would lead to</span> <strong>far greater <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">instability and war</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in the world, </span><u>imperil</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> American </span><u>security and deny the U</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates and its allies the </span><u>benefits of primacy</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. There are two critical issues in any discussion of America's grand strategy: Can America remain the dominant state? Should it strive to do this? </span><u>America can remain dominant due to its prodigious military, economic and soft power capa¬bilities</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The totality of that equation of power answers the first issue. The United States has </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">overwhelming</span> military <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">capabilities</span> and wealth in comparison <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to other states</span> or</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> likely potential </span><u>alliances</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Barring some disaster or tremendous folly, </span><u>that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">will remain the case</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> for the foreseeable future. With few exceptions, even those who advocate retrenchment acknowledge this. So the debate revolves around the desirability of maintaining American pri¬macy. Proponents of retrenchment focus a great deal on the costs of U.S. action¬ but they fall to realize what is good about American primacy. The price and </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">risks</span> of primacy <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are reported</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in newspapers </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">every day</span>; the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">benefits</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that stem from it </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are not. A</span> GRAND <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">strategy</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of ensur¬ing American primacy takes as its starting point the protec¬tion of the U.S. homeland and American global interests. These interests </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">include ensuring</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that critical </span><u>resources like <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">oil</span> flow</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> around the world, that the </span><u>global <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">trade</span> and monetary regimes flourish and</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that Washington's worldwide network of </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">allies</span> is reassured and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">protected</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Allies are a great asset to the United States, in part because they shoulder some of its burdens. Thus, it is no surprise to see NATO in Afghanistan or the Australians in East Timor. In contrast, a strategy based on </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">retrenchment will not be able to achieve these</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> fundamental </span><u>objectives</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> of the United States. Indeed, retrenchment will make the United States less secure than the present grand strategy of primacy. This is because </span><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">threats will exist no matter what</span></u></strong> <u>role America</u> <u>chooses to play</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in international politics. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Washington cannot</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> call a &quot;time out&quot;, and it cannot </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">hide</span> from threats</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span><u>Whether they are terrorists</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><u>rogue states or rising powers, <strong>history shows that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">threats must be confronted</span></strong></u><strong>.</strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Simply by declaring that the United States is &quot;going home&quot;, thus </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">abandoning</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> its </span><u>commitments</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> or making unconvinc¬ing half pledges to defend its interests and allies, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">does not mean</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">others will respect American wishes</span> to retreat</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. To make </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">such a declaration</span></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">implies weak-ness and</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">emboldens aggression</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. In the anarchic world of the animal kingdom, predators prefer to eat the weak rather than confront the strong. The same is true of the anarchic world of interna¬tional politics. If there is no diplomatic solution to the threats that confront the United States, then the conventional and strategic military power of the United States is what protects the country from such threats. And when enemies must be confront¬ed, a strategy based on primacy focuses on engaging enemies overseas, away from .American soil. Indeed, a key tenet of the Bush Doctrine is to attack terrorists far from America's shores and not to wait while they use bases in other countries to plan and train for attacks against the United States itself. This requires </span><u>a</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> phys¬ical, </span><u>on the ground presence</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> that </span><u>cannot be achieved by offshore balancing</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Indeed, as Barry Posen has noted, U.S. </span><u>primacy is secured because America</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, at present, </span><u>commands the &quot;global common&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the oceans, the world's airspace and outer space allowing the United States to project its power far from its borders, while </span><u>denying those</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> common </span><u>avenues to its enemies</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. As a consequence, the costs of power projection for the United States and its allies are reduced, and the robustness of the United States' conventional and strategic deterrent ca¬pabilities is increased.' This is not an advantage that should be relinquished lightly. A remarkable fact about international politics today -</span><u>in a world where American primacy is clearly</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">and unambiguous¬ly </span><u>on display</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">--is that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">countries want to align themselves with the</span></u> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">U</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates. Of course, this is not out of any sense of altruism, in most cases, but </span><u>because <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">doing so allows them to use the power of the</span></u> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">U</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">for their own purposes</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, ¬their own </span><u>protection</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span><u>or</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">to gain greater </span><u>influence</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Of 192 countries, 84 are allied with America -their </span><u>security</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> is </span><u>tied</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">to the United States </span><u>through</u> <u>treaties and</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> other </span><u>informal arrangements</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and they include almost all of the major economic and military powers. That is a ratio of almost 17 to one (85 to five), and a big change from the Cold War when the ratio was about 1.8 to one of states aligned with the United States versus the Soviet Union. Never before in its history has this coun¬try, or any country, had so many allies. U.S. primacy -and the bandwagon¬ing effect has also given us extensive influence in international politics, allowing the United States to shape the behavior of states and international institutions. Such influence comes in many forms, one of which is America's ability to cre¬ate coalitions of like minded states to free Kosovo, stabilize Afghanistan, invade Iraq or to stop proliferation through the Pro¬liferation Security Initiative (PSI). Doing so allows the United States to operate with allies outside of the where it can be stymied by opponents. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">American led wars</span> in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">stand in contrast to the UN's inability to save the people of Darfur or</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> even </span><u>to conduct any military campaign</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to realize the goals of its charter.

Khan </span><u>proliferation network are in sharp relief to the typically toothless attempts by the UN</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> to halt proliferation. You can count with one hand countries opposed to the United States. They are the &quot;Gang of Five&quot;: China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Venezeula. Of course, countries like India, for example, do not agree with all policy choices made by the United States, such as toward Iran, but New Delhi is friendly to Washington. Only the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; may be expected to consistently resist the agenda and ac¬tions of the United States. China is clearly the most important of these states because it is a rising great power. But </span><u>even Beijing is intimidated</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> by the United States </span><u>and refrains from openly challenging U.S. power</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. China proclaims that it will, if necessary, re¬sort to other mechanisms of challenging the United States, including asymmetric strategies such as targeting communica¬tion and intelligence satellites upon which the United States depends. But China may not be confident those strategies would work, and so it is likely to refrain from testing the United States directly for the foreseeable future because China's power benefits, as we shall see, from the international order U.S. primacy creates. The other states are far weaker than China. For three of the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; cases Venezuela, Iran, Cuba it is an anti U.S. regime that is the source of the problem; the country itself is not intrin¬sically anti American. Indeed, a change of regime in Caracas, Tehran or Havana could very well reorient relations. THROUGHOUT HISTORY, </span><u>peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Rome, Britain or the United States today. Schol¬ars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. Everything we think of </span><u>when we consider</u> <u>the current international order free trade, a robust monetary regime,</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">increas¬ing respect for </span><u>human rights</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, growing </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">democratization is</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> directly </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">linked</span> to U.S. power</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it. In that they are dead wrong and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons: </span><u>Appalling things happen when international orders collapse. The Dark Ages fol-lowed</u> <u>Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. With¬out U.S. power, </span><u>the liberal order</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> cre¬ated </span><u>by the U</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span><u>will end just as assuredly</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. As country and western great Rai Donner sang: &quot;You don't know what you've got (until you lose it).&quot; Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washing¬ton and the world. The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, </span><u>U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, most notably France and West Germany. Today, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">American primacy</span> helps <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">keep</span> a number of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">complicated relationships aligned</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> -between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia. This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war. Wars still occur where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, but a </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Pax Americana does reduce</span> war's likelihood, particularly</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> war's worst form: </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">great power wars</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Second, </span><u>American power gives the U</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span><u>the ability to spread democracy</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and other elements of its ideology of liberalism. Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because, as John Owen noted on these pages in the Spring 2006 issue, </span><u>liberal democracies are</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> more </span><u>likely to align with the</u> <u>U</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates </span><u>and be sympathetic to the American worldview</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.3 So, spreading democracy helps maintain U.S. primacy. In addition, once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced. This is not because </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">democracies</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> do not have clashing inter¬ests. Indeed they do. Rather, it is because </span><u>they <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are</span> more <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">open,</span> more transparent <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> more </span><u>likely to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">want to resolve things amicably</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in concurrence with U.S. lead¬ership. And so, in general, democratic states are good for their citizens as well as for advancing the interests of the United States. Critics have faulted the Bush Admin¬istration for attempting to spread democ¬racy in the Middle East, labeling such an effort a modern form of tilting at windmills. It is the obligation of Bush's crit¬ics to explain why democracy is good enough for Western states but not for the rest, and, one gathers from the argument, should not even be attempted. Of course, whether democracy in the Middle East will have a peaceful or sta¬bilizing influence on America's interests in the short run is open to question. Per¬haps democratic Arab states would be more opposed to Israel, but nonetheless, their people would be better off. The United States has brought democracy to Afghanistan, where 8.5 million Af¬ghans, 40 percent of them women, voted in a critical October 2004 election, even though remnant Taliban forces threat¬ened them. The first free elections were held in Iraq in January 2005. It was the military power of the United States that put Iraq on the path to democracy. Wash¬ington fostered democratic governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Caucasus. Now </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">even the Middle East is increasingly democratic</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. They may not yet look like Western style democracies, but </span><u>democratic progress has been made in Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, Kuwait</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, the Palestinian Authority </span><u>and Egypt</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. By all accounts, the march of democracy has been impressive. Third, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">along with</span> the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">growth</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in the number </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">of democratic states</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> around the world </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">has been the growth of the global economy</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. With its allies, the United States has labored to create an economically liberal worldwide network character¬ized by free trade and commerce, respect for international property rights, and mo-bility of capital and labor markets. </span><u>The economic stability and prosperity that stems from this economic order is <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a global public good</span> from which all states benefit,</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">particularly the poorest states in the Third World. The United States created this network not out of altruism but for the benefit and the economic well being of America. </span><u>This economic order forces American industries to be competitive, maximizes efficiencies</u> <u>and growth, and benefits defense</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> as well because the size of the economy makes the defense burden manageable. Economic spin offs foster the development of military technology, helping to ensure military prowess. Perhaps the greatest testament to the benefits of the economic network comes from Deepak Lal, a former Indian foreign service diplomat and researcher at the World Bank, who started his ca¬reer confident in the socialist ideology of post independence India. Abandoning the positions of his youth, Lal now recog¬nizes that the only way to bring relief to desperately poor countries of the Third World is through the adoption of free market economic policies and globaliza¬tion, which are facilitated through Amer¬ican primacy.4 As a witness to the failed alternative economic systems, Lal is one of the strongest academic proponents of American primacy due to the economic prosperity it provides. Fourth and finally, </span><u>the U</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">tates, in seeking primacy, </span><u>has been willing to use its power</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> not only to advance its interests but </span><u>to promote the welfare of people all over the globe</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.

About 20,000 U.S. soldiers, sail¬ors, airmen and marines responded by providing water, food, medical aid, disease treatment and prevention as well as foren¬sic assistance to help identify the bodies of those killed. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Only the U.S. military could have accomplished this</span> Herculean effort.

In fact, UN peace¬keeping operations depend on the United States to supply UN forces. American generosity has done more to help the United States fight the War on Terror than almost any other measure. Before the tsunami, 80 percent of Indo¬nesian public opinion was opposed to the United States; after it, 80 percent had a favorable opinion of America.

<span class="Underline">A security guarantee policy has its risks and costs. If, after contemplating these, U.S. policy makers decide to proceed, there are several actions they should take to increase the probability of success. Collectively, the Gulf Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman have enough conventional military power to deter Iran.8 These states and the others in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) should be the main bulwark deterring Iran. However, they come up short due to inadequate defense cooperation, a lack of trust with each other, and lingering doubts about U.S. commitment. The U.S. government will need to improve its efforts regarding Gulf defense cooperation and security assistance to take advantage of the potential for local deterrence in the region. U.S. Central Command’s deployments to the region will be a critical element of success. U.S. policy makers will have to find a balance between deploying sufficient forces to provide credibility and reassurance, while avoiding deployments that are politically corrosive or provide a disincentive for GCC members to fulfill their responsibilities. Improvements in U.S. long-range strike capabilities—forces that would provide deterrence but would not be physically present in the region—could be part of the solution. As mentioned above, we should expect a nuclear-armed Iran to become more aggressive in the irregular warfare dimension. Stepped-up Iranian irregular warfare activity could appear in the form of increased Shiite militia activity in Iraq, greater unrest among Shiite populations in the Arab Persian Gulf states, a more aggressive Hezbollah organization in Lebanon, and more terrorist intimidation in the region and beyond. The frontline defense against Iranian irregular warfare must come from the states in the region, with the U.S. government supporting from the background. The frontline states will have to respond to Iranian irregular warfare efforts with improved internal security measures, but also with improved social, political, economic, and information warfare efforts. The United States can assist, armed with the lessons it has learned from its irregular warfare campaigns over the past decade. But the most effective response to irregular Iranian pressure will come from the governments in the region. Finally, the United States and its allies need to develop leverage against Iran. The absence of leverage is the principal reason the engagement and sanctions strategies have failed. But should the United States and its allies shift to a containment and deterrence approach, it will be no less important to develop means to hold at risk those things the Iranian regime values most. Last September, during an interview with Al Jazeera, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates discussed his hopes in this regard: And so the more that our Arab friends and allies can strengthen their security capabilities, the more they can strengthen their cooperation both with each other and with us, I think, sends the signal to the Iranians that this path that they're on is not going to advance Iranian security but in fact could weaken itg.9 And so that's one of the reasons why I think our relationship with these countries and our security cooperation with them is so important. Part of what Gates implied is an Arab and U.S. offensive capability against Iran that would hold at risk Iranian assets. Offensive action should not be limited to just conventional military actions. It should also include public diplomacy, cyber warfare, unconventional warfare, and covert actions aimed at undermining the authority of the regime. The goal would be to create credible capabilities in these areas in order to persuade the Iranian leadership to adopt different policies. Prepare for a long struggle More broadly, if U.S. policy makers opt for a security guarantee, they need to prepare the American public for what to expect. Just as with the Cold War, a security guarantee will commit the U.S. to a long struggle against an intelligent and experienced adversary who possesses important competitive advantages. A security guarantee will risk U.S. prestige and military forces. It will also create second- and third-order risks, such as increased friction with China, which will increasingly become Iran’s patron. The purpose of a security guarantee is to avoid Iranian regional hegemony, an unstable nuclear and missile arms race, or a near-term preventive war against Iran, the long-term costs of which would very likely exceed the short-lived benefits. This essay has attempted to demonstrate that a security guarantee is no panacea, and will have its own significant costs and risks. U.S. policy makers must explain to the American public these costs and risks. Public understanding and acceptance of these costs is necessary if a U.S. security guarantee is to be credible and sustained over the long challenge ahead. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The case for a U.S. military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities remains weak. Washington does not know where all the underground uranium enrichment facilities are. They are tough to hit. Even if destroyed, they can be rebuilt. A strike might actually set back Iran’s bomb program, but just one to three years. If President Barack Obama authorized one, especially without United Nations sanction, he could be viewed as repeating President George W. Bush’s pre-emption mistakes, increase risks of an Iranian response and possibly help President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bolster his domestic political position. In fact, we don’t even favor keeping force on the table. You don’t threaten a war you know is a bad idea. Doing so puts pressure on Obama to strike if and when diplomatic and economic approaches fail to rein in Iran’s program. In addition, even if the charge is unfair, Obama’s critics at home could accuse him of weakness, increasing the pressure on him to consider an attack. America’s credibility might also be weakened, since Washington would be seen as having its bluff called. Future scenarios in which the United States might wish to credibly threaten an attack against an adversary, perhaps even Iran, would then be harder to handle. So the Obama administration would do well to stop talking publicly about a military option and, instead, tell regional allies a strike is highly unlikely unless Iran’s behavior becomes far more egregious. But what about Israel? How should Washington think about the possibility that the Jewish state, having long heard Ahmadinejad’s belligerent threats, might itself strike Iran? This could implicate Washington in the eyes of many, for Israel probably would not act without giving the United States tactical warning — if only to protect its own planes. Yet, as long as Washington keeps the military option on the table, it is implicitly legitimizing Israel’s right to do so, too. Just as it makes little sense for the United States to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, it is also not a good idea for Israel — now or in the foreseeable future, under any plausible scenario. The same military arguments are relevant. In fact, with its smaller air force and greater distances to fly, Israel would surely be less effective in demolishing Iran’s underground facilities than America would — meaning that Iran’s efforts might be delayed only a year or two. Tehran would likely lash out at the United States as much as at Israel — especially with 200,000 American GIs deployed in the region. Also, Obama’s efforts to improve relations with the broader Muslim world, demonstrated last year with his speech in Cairo, would be greatly complicated by what many would see as yet another American attack on a Muslim state. A few Gulf states might privately welcome the strike. But most of the Islamic world would ask why a state that the Federation of American Scientists says has 80 nuclear weapons of its own was justified in attacking another that has yet to produce one such weapon. This double-standard argument could resonate from Morocco to Indonesia. America’s most vital partners in the war against Al Qaeda would have a harder time working closely with Washington on counterterrorism and bolstering defensive preparations that Iran’s belligerence has helped produce in recent years. It would also undermine governments in key regional states that welcome our presengce and help. Jordan, Turkey, Pakistan and Indonesia would again have to explain to their angry populations why security partnerships were necessary with a foreign power too friendly to Israel and too inclined to strike any Muslim state that gets out of line. This battle of perceptions, now starting to work in our favor, could turn against us. An Iranian nuclear bomb would clearly be a bad thing. We must continue to do everything in our power, on the diplomatic and economic-sanctions fronts, to make it less likely — and to deter it if we have to. To discourage Israel from any attack, we need to remind its leaders of three key points: • U.S. security is implicated in how this is handled, too, because our troops and interests are exposed and subject to Iranian reprisal after any strike. • An Iranian bomb would strengthen, not weaken, the U.S. commitment to Middle East security. Washington would need to more forcefully project a U.S. nuclear umbrella policy to protect regional friends. Iran would be put on notice that it should assume any nuclear strike against other countries in the region would lead to U.S. retaliation. • Israel would actually be less alone if Iran got the bomb, since it would not be the only state threatened. Finally, should Iran move to build nuclear reactors and plutonium-reprocessing facilities capable of producing enough plutonium for a large number of bombs, a different conversation could occur about whether military action made sense. Aboveground facilities, like reactors, are easier to strike — especially before they become operational. These arguments alone cannot prevent Israel from carrying out an attack. It must make its own decisions. But it would be more difficult for Israel to strike if Washington made its opposition to a strike clear and strongly recommitted to the long-term security of its friends in the region. The Obama administration should have this conversation with Israel quietly — before we wake up one morning to a fait accompli. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">At this time, however, a withdrawal of America’s nuclear arsenal from Europe would send the message that transatlantic security is no longer indivisible. It would also give Moscow a blank check to pursue its long-sought-after sphere of privileged interest and, ironically, could pave the way for further nuclear proliferation. The destabilization brought to the European continent from a premature removal of American nuclear weapons, or an unacceptable degradation of its force, would be a major setback for global security and stability. The Need for Nuclear Weapons in Europe From a strategic standpoint, a proactive national defense relies on the ability to defend physical territory, as well as the ability to deter an enemy attack in the first place. In a highly dangerous world where hostile states—such as Iran and North Korea—possess both nuclear and conventional forces capable of striking the U.S. and its allies, a credible nuclear deterrence, not unilateral disarmament, is the best chance for peace. Therefore, the U.S., in consultation with its allies, should use nuclear weapons in Europe and in the U.S. to protect and defend the U.S. and its allies against strategic attack. This position is consistent with a more defensive, broader strategic posture that would require the deployment of robust defensive systems, including ballistic missile defenses. This posture would also require modernizing the nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal, including their delivery systems, to make them better suited to destroying targets that are likely to be used to launch strategic attacks against the U.S. and its allies, as well as targets whose destruction requires the more powerful force of nuclear weapons. These targets could include missiles in hardened silos, deeply buried command and control facilities, and heavily protected nuclear weapons depots. A Threat to NATO Not since radical leftist sentiment gripped Western Europe in the 1980s has the transatlantic relationship faced such a serious ideological challenge to the mutual security of North America and Europe. The removal of American tactical nuclear weapons from European and NATO bases would spell the end of the alliance and the concept of indivisible security. The Russian militarization of the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad and Moscow’s recent simulation of a nuclear attack on Poland require a robust response from NATO, reinforced by America’s continued nuclear guarantee. Moscow’s simulation—in which Russian armed forces invaded Poland and its air force fired nuclear missiles against Warsaw and acted in conjunction with Belarus to suppress Polish minorities in Belarus—was codenamed “West” and labeled Poland as the aggressor country. Following this exercise, as well as President Obama’s ill-defined policy of “resetting” relations with Russia, Central and Eastern Europe has sought specific assurances as to the indivisibility of the alliance’s security. In addressing these concerns, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has stated: I want to reaffirm as strongly as I can the United States ’ commitment to honor Article 5 of the NATO treaty. No Ally—or adversary—should ever question our determination on this point. It is the bedrock of the Alliance and an obligation that time will not erode. Our nation faces threats elsewhere in the world, but we view peace and stability in Europe as a prerequisite for addressing all of the other challenges. A nuclear pullout from Europe does not comport with Secretary Clinton’s commitments outlined above. Rather than pulling back from the alliance’s commitments, the U.S. should honor Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty and plan against Moscow’s threat to the territorial integrity, political independence, and security of one of its members. This preparation should be underpinned by the sanctity of Article 5, America’s tactical and strategic nuclear insurance. Achieving the Exact Opposite The vast majority of America’s allies in Europe have not sought to join the club of nuclear weapons powers, largely because they enjoy the comfort of the U.S.’s nuclear umbrella. However, America’s unilateral nuclear disarmament may prompt some nations—particularly Poland in light of Moscow’s war gaming and Warsaw’s general sense of a transatlantic distancing—to seek alternate security insurance. Indeed, Turkey and countless other non-nuclear powers under the NATO umbrella could further be tempted to fill the security vacuum created by America’s unilateral disarmament by seeking their own weapons or forming alliances with other nuclear powers. The removal of American tactical nuclear weapons could also encourage a hostile nation to seek similar weapons if it perceives America’s indifference to the transatlantic alliance. Russia and rogue states such as Iran and Syria could be emboldened by America’s retreat from its security commitments to Europe. Russia has already proved itself to be an authoritarian power, seeking to regain influence over its former satellites. In short, the ramifications of this measure are unpredictable and likely to be contrary to President Obama’s goal of nuclear disarmament. Critical Factors Ignored This week, President Obama reaffirmed his commitment to reducing America’s nuclear stockpile, stating that he wants to see transformational change in the U.S. nuclear posture. However, his policy preferences should be only one part of the equation. The position of America’s friends and allies, the strategic concept of the NATO alliance, and transatlantic stability should also factor into his decision. Strategically, eliminating the U.S. tactical nuclear arsenal in Europe cripples deterrence, stripping away an important pillar of transatlantic security and placing European force posture at a disadvantage </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Turkey, like Israel, has expressed concern about the Indo-Pakistani nuclear race, as this will inevitably lead to an Iranian atomic bomb, which would be highly alarming to Ankara and force it to join the race. Turkey will be able to do this as soon as construction of several nuclear power plants on the Turkish coast is completed. The Turkish government has announced plans to build 10 nuclear reactors by 2020, the first of which is to be built at Akkuyu Bay. On 4 June, al-Sharq alAwsat reported that, seen with Arab eyes, the Turkish decision to build a nuclear reactor at Akkuyu Bay constitutes a new threat, aside from the military co-operation with Israel, to its Arab neighbors. This is particularly so as the reactor reportedly will come under the jurisdiction of the Turkish National Security Council. Turkey’s division to build a nuclear reactor is being justified by the nuclear tests last May on the Indian subcontinent and the Iranian nuclear programme, which is claimed bty Tehran to be aimed at acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purpose. Negotiations have commenced with German, US and Canadian companies for construction of the reactor, which may begin next year. Some Arab analysts do not seem to place too much trust in the guarantee that the reactor will be used for peaceful purposes only, and the distrust has been fanned by statements tmade by prominent retired Turkish military figures who have stressed the necessity of establishing Turlkish military supremacy in the region and of acquiring non conventional weapons, among other nuclear weapons. Iraq and Syria are particularly wary of a possible future emergence of Turkey as a nuclear power, as both countries oppose Ankara’s diversion of water from the Euphrates. This prospect will naturally also alarm Tehran, which might face two nuclear adversaries in the future instead of one. Whichever way you see it, it appears as if these fears of adversaries gaining possible advantages will trigger off a very dangerous arms race, with most countries in the region trying to develop WMD. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">There have also been reports that Israel, the United States, and Turkey have been involved with a plan to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities. In 1996, Israeli Government Press Office head Uri Dromi said it had become a &quot;working assumption&quot; that a &quot;Western-led coalition&quot; will conduct a pre-emptive strike against Iran to stop its nuclear weapons program.[232] One reported target was Iran's Neka nuclear plant, 100 miles north-east of Tehran on the Caspian Sea. According to Egyptian sources, the basis of the 1995 Israeli-Turkish military cooperation agreement may be plans for an air strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran has already made counter-threats against the possible attacks.[233] Another report claimed that Israeli pilots are training in Turkey's Central Anatolia region in preparation to bomb Iranian nuclear reactors and other nuclear weapons facilities.[234]There has already been some reason for security concerns about a proposed nuclear plant at Akkuyu Bay. The plant would almost be within sight of the divided island of Cyprus. The Turkish ferry port to Cyprus isjust outside of Silifke. Cyprus has been divided for over 25 years, since Turkey invaded and occupied thenorthern third of island in 1974, following a coup engineered by the military junta that ruled Greece at thetime. About 30,000 Turkish troops occupy the northern part of Cyprus, which declared itself an independentstate in 1983, but is recognized only by Turkey.In January 1997, the Cypriot government announced that it would buy the Russian S-300 surface-to-airmissile (SAM) system as a defence against Turkish air force incursions. The missiles have a range of about150 km. Turkey, then under the leadership of Necmettin Erbakan of the Islamist Welfare Party, declared thatit would consider a military strike against the placement of the missile launchers, and that it would attack ships carrying the missiles to Cyprus.[235] Russia stated that it would consider attacks on its ships to be an act of war, and it would almost certainly initiate a regional war between Turkey and Greeceg,because of thedefence pact between Greece and Cyprus. Turkish/Cypriot relations were already strained by four deaths inCyprus in 1996. Exhibiting considerable statesmanship and restraint, following a December 1998 consultation betweenGreece and Cyprus, the Cypriot government of President Glafcos Clerides decided that it would abandon theproposed missile siting in Cyprus, and deploy them on the Greek island of Crete.[236] In Turkey, theCypriot decision was commonly seen as a 'victory' for the aggressive position that had been taken against themissile deployment. This 'victory' over Cyprus was a factor contributing to the victory of Bulent Ecevit andthe strong showing of the nationalist MHP in the April 1999 election. Ecevit was Prime Minister of Turkey in1974, when he ordered the invasion of Cyprus. The problem of Cyprus is far from resolved, and the presence of the Akkuyu nuclear plant will pose an additional aggravation and complicating factor if it is built. Theplant would pose a tempting target to Turkey's hostile neighbours. Potential conflicts are not just with Greeceand Cyprus, but with countries such as Iran, Iraq and Syria, all of whom may perceive a nuclear program inTurkey as a threat to their national security. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">[David. Professor of International Studies at the Naval Postgraduate School. “Assurance and US Extended Deterrence in NATO” International Affairs, Vol 85 No4 InformaWorld<em>GBS-JV]</em> </span><br />
<br />
<em><span class="Underline">Owing in large part to President George H. W. Bush’s initiatives in 1991, the US nuclear presence in Europe was drastically reduced, with the removal of all ground-based shorter-range systems. As noted above, the current US nuclear posture in Europe consists solely of dual-capable aircraft and gravity bombs.10 Inferences about current views concerning the requirements of assurance can be made from the declaratory policies of the allies and their operational practices. The 1999 Strategic Concept articulated longstanding views about what is necessary for assurance, including ‘widespread participation by European allies involved in collective defence planning in nuclear roles, in peacetime basing of nuclear forces on their territory and in command, control and consultation arrangements’. 11 While all the allies except France participate in NPG and other alliance nuclear consultations, the practical significance of the concept of ‘widespread participation … in peacetime basing of nuclear forces’ has changed, and is continuing to change, with NATO enlargement. The number of allies accepting such responsibilities is a shrinking proportion of the total. Because NATO has not identified targets for its nuclear forces since the 1990s, it is a challenge to specify and analyse the 1999 Strategic Concept’s requirement for ‘adequate nuclear forces in Europe … at the minimum level sufficient to preserve peace and stability’. The minimum level may derive more from judgements about an appropriate level of risk- and responsibility-sharing among allies, and about what is necessary to demonstrate continuing US engagement and commitment, than from a quantitative analysis of potential contingencies. The continuing requirements of assurance in the nuclear domain deserve analysis, and not only because they relate to the alliance’s non-proliferation goals. This article considers the ‘why’ issues—the probable purposes and roles of US nuclear forces in Europe with respect to assurance—before turning to the ‘how’ issues: the various elements that appear to contribute to a credible and effective posture for assurance. Continuing assurance roles for US nuclear forces in Europe The assurance roles for US nuclear forces in Europe appear to include the following: to serve as a hedge against Russian recidivism; to deter regional powers armed with weapons of mass destruction (WMD); to provide an alternative to considering dependence on French and/or British nuclear forces; to offer an alternative to the pursuit of national nuclear forces; and to supply evidence of the genuineness of US commitments. Each of these roles deserves a brief discussion. Hedge against Russian recidivism The alliance’s 1999 Strategic Concept dropped the ‘strategic balance’ language concerning NATO–Russia relations found in the 1991 Strategic Concept. It nonetheless included subtle references to the alliance’s continuing responsibility to hedge against the risk of backsliding in Moscow, given Russia’s long-term power potential, particularly its nuclear forces: Notwithstanding positive developments in the strategic environment and the fact that large-scale conventional aggression against the alliance is highly unlikely, the possibility of such a threat emerging over the longer term exists … The existence of powerful nuclear forces outside the alliance also constitutes a significant factor which the alliance has to take into account if security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area are to be maintained.12 In July 2002 Colin Powell, then the US Secretary of State, offered a rare public acknowledgement that one of the factors defining the US nuclear posture must be the continuing need for a hedge against potential adverse developments in Russia. In Powell’s words, ‘there are nuclear-armed nations out there, particularly Russia, [and] even though it is a new relationship, a new partnership—they will have nuclear weapons for many, many years to come, and one cannot predict the future with certainty. So therefore it is wise for us, in view of that … to give us a hedge.’13 </span></em><br />

<span class="Underline">Russian internal troubles—such as a leadership crisis, coup, or civil war—could aggravate Russia's fears of foreign aggression and lead to a miscalculation of U.S. intentions and to nuclear overreaction. While this may sound like a complicated and improbable chain of events, Russia's story in the 1990s is one long series of domestic crises that have all too often been the source of nuclear close calls. The war scares of August 1991 and October 1993 arose out of coup attempts. The civil war in Chechnya caused a leadership crisis in Moscow, which contributed to the nuclear false alarm during Norway's launch of a meteorological rocket in January 1995. Nuclear war arising from Russian domestic crises is a threat the West did not face, or at least faced to a much lesser extent, during the Cold W</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Takahashi December 2010 – Senior Fellow at the National Institute for Defense Studies Tokyo, Japan (Sugio, “US Extended Deterrence and Japan’s Security,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:7979:http://www.iips.org/jussec/J-US-SEC2010e.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iips.org/jussec/J-US-SEC2010e.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.iips.org/jussec/J-US-SEC2010e.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:7979 -->) </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Moreover, it must be noted that the US extended deterrence for protecting Japan needs to be evaluated on the basis of two distinct points at issue. The first point is deterrence of an actual nuclear attack on Japan. This can be assessed in terms of the US commitment to extended deterrence to protect Japan, as is its declared policy. This has been repeatedly affirmed, with the attestation of then-Secretary of State Rice immediately after the 2006 nuclear test by North Korea that the US would meet the “full range of its deterrent…commitments to Japan,” the joint communiqué issued by the Japan-US Security Consultative Committee in 2007, and the statements by Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama immediately after North Korea’s missile launch and nuclear test in 2009. Given that this kind of political commitment is a sign of the US government’s own strength of purpose and that the NPR repeatedly emphasizes the importance of extended deterrence to protect allies, as long as the Japan-US relationship continues to progress stably in the future, there is no cause for any major concern over the reliability of the US political commitment to extended deterrence. In order to maintain and strengthen the reliability of extended deterrence in the future, it will, of course, be vital to continue to develop an even closer relationship between Japan and the US in defense cooperation. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Nevertheless, the American leadership is not sufficient for our moving toward a nuclear weapon free world. The global security environment of today is so complicated that the goal cannot be achieved without cooperation and commitment of all nuclear weapon states and key non-nuclear weapon states. This is a fundamental reason we need to consider the role of non-nuclear U.S. allies including Japan for eliminating nuclear weapons. Besides, many of them have advanced nuclear capabilities. This implies that they are in a position to influence U.S. national security policy as well as the international politics of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. If so, what could Japan do to promote nuclear disarmament possibly in cooperation with other non-nuclear U.S. allies? The purpose of this paper is to explore an answer to this question. And for this purpose, I address a policy concept which is familiar to experts in the arms control and disarmament community. That is “no-first-use of nuclear weapons.” A simple definition of the concept is to declare to use nuclear weapons only in response to an attack with nuclear weapons. As I discuss below, nuclear weapon states could facilitate nuclear disarmament and strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation regime by adopting a no-first-use policy. Nevertheless, the United States and U.S.-led alliances have never adopted a no-first-use policy until today. This, however, could be changed under the Obama administration. Currently, the U.S. government is drafting Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). This process is legally mandated by U.S. Congress, which will be completed by the end of this year. And the final document will guide the nuclear weapons policy of the Obama administration. The very language of “no-first-use” is unlikely to be used in the text of NPR, because it seems unacceptable to the national security establishment of the United States. But, for the first time in history, it is seriously discussed within the U.S. government to limit the purpose of U.S. nuclear arsenal to deterring the use of nuclear weapons. In other words, the basic idea of no-first-use could be absorbed in a renewed NPR, to revise U.S. nuclear weapons policy(2). Non-nuclear U.S. allies, in turn, would have to review the role of U.S. nuclear deterrent in their national security policies. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">There is, ultimately, going to be a post from me about the details of the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review — but the details are probably not what is important. So, let me start with that. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">What is important is that the NPR ledes with the notion that the priority goal is to prevent nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism. That, conceptually, is an important shift. There have always been two views of nuclear weapons: One view holds that nuclear weapons are just another munition, albeit larger, in a modern armory. Ours our good; theirs are bad. Another view, however, is that nuclear weapons represent a shared danger that ultimately compels us to cooperate even with our adversaries. The Nuclear Posture Review places the deterrent value of nuclear weapons in this much larger context of confronting the shared danger posed by the existence of nuclear weapons, including nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism. If I understand Josh correctly, this is what he intends to convey with the image of a tunnel dug from two ends. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Nuclear terrorism escalates to global nuclear war </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Ayson2010 (Robert, Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand at the Victoria University of Wellington, “After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects,” Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism, Volume 33, Issue 7, July) </span><br />
<span class="Underline">A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by the country attacked in the first place, would not necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds imaginable. Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether nuclear terrorism should ever be regarded as belonging in the category of truly existential threats. A contrast can be drawn here with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear exchange between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these weapons in significant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the twenty-first century might bring would fade into insignificance alongside considerations of what a general nuclear war would have wrought in the Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as the major nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of nuclear weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a truly awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state possessors themselves. But these two nuclear worlds—a non-state actor nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange—are not necessarily separable. It is just possible that some sort of terrorist attack, and especially an act of nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a chain of events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapons between two or more of the states that possess them. In this context, today's and tomorrow's terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the early Cold War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals who were seen as raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war between the superpowers started by third parties. These risks were considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem. It may require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially plausible situation where an act of nuclear terrorism could lead to such a massive inter-state nuclear war. For example, in the event of a terrorist nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered just how Russia and/or China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not least because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far too responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist behavior that could just as easily threaten them as well. Some possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example, how might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that the fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from Russian stocks,40 and if for some reason Moscow denied any responsibility for nuclear laxity? The correct attribution of that nuclear material to a particular country might not be a case of science fiction given the observation by Michael Bay et al. that while the debris resulting from a nuclear explosion would be &quot;spread over a wide area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable, identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of information can be obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the explosion, the materials used and, most important ... some indication of where the nuclear material came from.&quot;41 Alternatively, if the act of nuclear terrorism came as a complete surprise, and American officials refused to believe that a terrorist group was fully responsible(or responsible at all) suspicion would shift immediately to state possessors. Ruling out Western ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably Israel and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a very short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program continues, and possibly Pakistan. But at what stage would Russia and China be definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear Cluedo?In particular, if the act of nuclear terrorism occurred against a backdrop of existing tension in Washington's relations with Russia and/or China, and at a time when threats had already been traded between these major powers, would officials and political leaders not be tempted to assume the worst? Of course, the chances of this occurring would only seem to increase if the United States was already involved in some sort of limited armed conflict with Russia and/or China, or if they were confronting each other from a distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments may seem at the present time. The reverse might well apply too: should a nuclear terrorist attack occur in Russia or China during a period of heightened tension or even limited conflict with the United States, could Moscow and Beijing resist the pressures that might rise domestically to consider the United States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of the attack? Washington's early response to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own soil might also raise the possibility of an unwanted (and nuclear aided) confrontation with Russia and/or China. For example, in the noise and confusion during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist nuclear attack, the U.S. president might be expected to place the country's armed forces, including its nuclear arsenal, on a higher stage of alert. In such a tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of reality, it is just possible that Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intentions to use force (and possibly nuclear force) against them. In that situation, the temptations to preempt such actions might grow, although it must be admitted that any preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response. </span><br />
